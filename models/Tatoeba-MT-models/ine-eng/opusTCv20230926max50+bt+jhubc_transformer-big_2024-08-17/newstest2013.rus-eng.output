The Republican Strategy of Resistance to Obama's Re-Election
The Republican leaders justified their policies by the need to fight falsifications in the elections.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, arguing that cases of election fraud in the United States are more rare than deaths from lightning strikes.
In addition, Republican lawyers counted only 300 cases of electoral falsification in the United States in ten years.
One thing can be said with confidence: these new trends will have a negative impact on the turnout of voters.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
That is why most state governments since 2009 have passed laws that complicate the process of registration or voting.
This phenomenon gained new momentum after the November 2010 election, which brought Republicans 675 new seats in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills limiting voting rights in 41 states were passed in just one year in 2011.
The new election laws require the voter to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws shorten the period of early voting, abolish the right of registration of the voter on the day of the will and deprive citizens of the right to vote who are guilty.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law in 2008.
The republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have initiated bills that require voters to present ID cards with photographs in 34 states.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have such a universal identity card as a health insurance card.
In fact, 11 percent of U.S. citizens—that is, 21 million people who have reached the age required to vote—do not have an identity card with a photograph issued by their state’s government.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such a document.
At the same time, the cost of obtaining the required identity card often exceeds a hundred dollars.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
In fact, 25 percent of African Americans, 15 percent of people earning less than $35,000, 18 percent of citizens over the age of 65, and 20 percent of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
But that's not all.
Voter students who are believed to vote for Democratic candidates are not allowed to use a photo ID issued by their school in several states.
But those same states allow members of fishing and hunting clubs that vote mostly for Republicans to use the certificates issued by those clubs for voting.
Until 2004, no state required proof of U.S. citizenship to vote.
For the first time, such a requirement was introduced in Arizona.
Since 2011, more than 10 states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures are obviously aimed at limiting the voting of Latinos.
It is estimated that two-thirds of Latin American voters vote in favor of the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers initiated in 2011 laws abolishing voter registration on the day of the vote in eight states.
They also restricted the right of individuals or groups to provide assistance to those wishing to register.
This restriction did not pass without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 elections, the voter registration campaign helped to list about 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken since 2009 have led to a 17% drop in the level of registration of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states passed laws aimed at reducing the period of early voting.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of early voters were African-American, although the latter accounted for only 13% of the state’s total electorate.
The same was true of those from Latin America.
Representing only 11% of voters, they made up 24% of citizens who voted early.
In contrast to whites, who formed 76 percent of voters, only 46 percent of those who voted early.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters are actively opposed to the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills were vetoed by Democratic governors.
The most ambiguous laws were suspended with the intervention of the United States Attorney General.
This allowed to partially limit the negative consequences.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring photo IDs.
However, the new rules that have come into force will certainly make it difficult to exercise the right to vote in the 2012 elections.
Critics of the Democrats condemn the biased laws that have been passed, seeing them as an obvious focus on influencing the results of the 2012 election in key states.
The Brennan Center’s 2011 report shows that the states that passed these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidential election.
It is too early to argue with confidence that these legislative changes at the electoral system level will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
Only one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on the turnout of voters.
In this sense, such actions partially discredit the system of American democracy.
Screening for prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes gives erroneous results, false-negative, and sometimes false-positive, which lead to useless medical intervention.
For men, and so reluctantly undergoing dispensation, there is more to be doubted about.
To take a test or not?
We asked for the opinion of two experts.
In studies conducted in the United States, there have been numerous cases of infection among the study groups, so the data obtained is difficult to interpret and it is difficult to make any clear recommendations.
Another study, this time European, found different levels of mortality in those patients who had undergone screening and those who had not.
This study also showed, after 12 years of observation, that the likelihood of metastasis is 30-40% higher in those who did not pass the screening.
Therefore, I would recommend taking the test starting at age 50, or 40, if one of the direct relatives had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also at increased risk.
The key point is to make the right decision as soon as the cancer is detected.
Cancer can be both aggressive and sluggish.
The patient needs to explain the degree of risk of his cancer, offering him possible options, without the mandatory treatment of prostate cancer, which does not pose a danger to life in the long term, and making the choice, in these cases, in favor of active monitoring of the disease.
To date, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer will not undergo a course of treatment, since their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to life.
We will offer them active monitoring, and if the disease begins to progress, we will begin treatment.
More and more often, we accurately determine the criteria for deciding who should or should not undergo a course of treatment.
I would recommend taking the test, though.
But it is also important to consult with your doctor to determine whether you need to take this test or not.
In collaboration with the International Association of Urology, Movember has created a tool to evaluate everything for and against passing the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, maintaining a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It is believed that if all people ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancer cases could be prevented.
“If no one smoked anymore, that figure would have risen to at least 50 percent,” said Andre Boley, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Association.
However, it is estimated that 10% of cancer cases are caused by heredity.
Several types of cancer remain completely inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Association, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the reduction in the number of smokers.
Smoking is associated with 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is a risk factor for many others.
It does enormous damage to people’s health.
“Even today, there are 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said spokesman André Bollier.
Ten years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weight
According to the CAR, excess weight and obesity also contribute to the appearance of the disease.
They increase the risk of breast, colon and rectal cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus.
"Studies show that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colon cancer," the association added.
Feeding
The association also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In too large quantities, it increases the risk of developing colon cancer.
Sausage products should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
"The latter can harm the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," the Association explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists have been studying the effects of vitamin supplements on cancer development.
But at the moment, the results of these studies cannot be called unambiguous.
According to the SCC, studies of vitamin E give conflicting results.
If one of them showed a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, the other gave the opposite result.
In the assessment of the impact on the development of vitamin D cancer, there is also no complete clarity.
However, Mr. Bollyo stressed that it was important to discuss his concerns and family history with a doctor.
"The fate of the analysis does not lead to cancer."
Higgs boson in detail
Last summer, a report that scientists may have been able to detect the Higgs boson caused a real stir - and not without reason.
It is believed that this boson explains the mass of all the particles in the universe, neither much nor little.
In addition, it is the last particle predicted to exist in the Standard Model — our best, or at least the “least imperfect” description of nature and the behavior of matter — but which has not previously been detected experimentally.
But physicists are not yet completely sure that it is the Higgs boson.
We know, without a shadow of a doubt, that we are dealing with a really new particle and that it strongly resembles the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
In addition, the new data presented this week at a major physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm this, although some data is not yet sufficient for full confidence.
Let’s imagine, however, that we are talking about the Higgs boson, since the chances of making a mistake seem minimal, and let’s see what it means.
There is, in this world, one law absolutely inevitable, which says that two things cannot be in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to circumvent this rule, do not even try too hard, otherwise harm yourself.
But although elementary particle physics is a rather strange world, it turns out that it also has one law of a similar nature: Pauli’s exclusion principle, which posits that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same “quantum state”—that is, some of their “states” are in common.
Based on this, physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner, we find good-natured citizens, called fermions, who wisely obey the Pauli principle.
In another, the bosons, a sinister band of anarchists who have no respect for anything — at least for this principle, which means they can rest assured to be in the same place at the same time.
As reported by the site (by the way, completely unusual) Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratory, these bosons are divided, in turn, into two groups: mesons, which we will not talk about here, and "particle of force", by means of which the main forces of nature are distributed and to which in some way the boon belongs.
These same bosons, it should be emphasized, are not all such exotic creatures as you might think.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it’s thanks to one incredibly banal boson: a photon, or “particle of light,” which is the “courier” of electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a single particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it “disrupts” the electromagnetic field at that particular location, much like a stone thrown into a pond.
From this "violation" an electromagnetic wave (light, or infrared radiation, or ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the bosons of the "transporters of force".
A more stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the only difference being that in order for this boson to appear, another field, the Higgs field, must be "broken".
However, the Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to achieve very and very high energies, as if it were a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be shaken by a very large stone.
That’s why you need a huge particle accelerator like the one used in CERN – the Large Hadron Collider, which is a ring with a diameter of 27 km! – to achieve such huge energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is also useful for explaining the relationship between the Higgs boson and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, such as magnets, interact, others do not: a sheet of paper, for example, will never stick to the refrigerator itself.
Similarly, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that interact have mass, while others (such as a photon, by the way) do not.
So, what can all these studies "bring" Mrs. Plamondon asks?
In science, they are used to verify the correctness of the Standard Model (SM), and this also allows physicists to sense the difference between the results of observations and the predictions of the SM.
In addition, some of them passionately yearn for such a discrepancy to be discovered, because the slightest discrepancy can open the door to "new physics" and close some of the Model's holes.
The latter, it must be said, still has significant drawbacks, offering no explanation for gravity (oh!) or for dark matter, which forms about 80% of the universe (oh!).
But so far, no such differences have been found in CERN.
Implications
The benefits of these studies for the daily life of the average person are harder to predict, but it would be a mistake to assume that it is not.
In the early 1960s, pioneers of laser research at Bell’s labs couldn’t even guess what a revolution their work would bring.
They predicted their applications in science, but no more.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Laboratories, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (previously impulsive) in 1962, said that the laser was originally viewed rather as a "laboratory gadget".
Imagine...
In addition, the application can be found for the toolkit accompanying the study.
For example, the same William Boyle during his optical research in 1969 developed a small light sensor.
This sensor, although it was not its original purpose at all, now serves as an “eye” for all digital cameras in the world and has earned the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that the work of the Large Hadron Collider will necessarily change our lives, but it only shows, in fact, that everything can be.
Palliative care is the best way to die... <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Commission for the Decent Death in Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
Debates should resume soon, and at this time a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this crucial area.
The "debt" tried to take a closer look.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. Still lived alone in his apartment in Montereggio.
Prostate cancer, which destroyed him from the inside, gave him a two-year delay.
"I was given five years, I lived seven," he says, between life and death, lying in bed in the palliative care ward of Victor-Gadbua in Belaya, where he arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, it's impossible to prepare for it," he says.
The disease does its job: an incredible weakness that does not allow you to go to the toilet on your own and even eat on your own.
Sitting at a table with an appetizing lunch, he surrenders and agrees to help him eat.
He wakes up, even manages to smile, talk to strangers who work around him, bring him medicine, take him to the bathroom.
Courage before ordinary death.
“My greatest desire to be cured of diarrhea is humiliating,” he admits.
A few hours later, the staff found a cure for this ailment.
“Throughout life we are taught that a man should urinate standing,” says Pierre Broder, a psychologist at Victor Gadbou’s clinic.
Regression to the condition of the child is an intolerable humiliation for some.
“It all depends on a person’s ability to cope with a decline,” he says.
Since, according to many people involved in palliative care, important events are happening in the midst of this decline.
Patients who enter Victor Gadbou's palliative care are all cancer patients.
Forecasts give them a maximum of three months to live.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses does not provide more help, called "medical."
Ms. A., 89 years old, is most afraid of dying "in the consciousness of strangulation."
But the illness allowed me to get to know my children.
“I have good children,” she adds.
“I don’t want anything in life anymore,” she says, before allowing her to wear a breathing mask.
She is still waiting for the next days for the last visit of her son, who came from Italy.
In the shelter Victor-Gadbua with the help of a group of volunteers provide body care and food assistance.
This is palliative care that remains when nothing else can be done.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is one place in palliative care institutions.
This is very little, given that sooner or later we will all die.
Here life goes on in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel - one of the doctors of the shelter.
Whether it’s physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
To the dying, we will agree to provide mouthwashes from brandy or Pepsi, as he asks.
We no longer force diabetics to control their sugar levels.
Death is a part of everyday life.
Last night we brought a beer to Mr. H., who died tonight.
In the morning his son drank this beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We are helping loved ones as well as patients,” says Natalie Savar, director of patient care.
In the reception of Victor-Gadbua, no day is like the previous one.
Next to a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last meeting with his family in the courtyard, lying on his pillows during a toast in his honor, a 36-year-old man tragically dies surrounded by his parents, his wife and two young children and tried everything to survive.
“In the past six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dr. Christian Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbua hospital come from home, and 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is estimated that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care that is provided to alleviate the suffering of patients who have entered the final stage of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a ward.
And some institutions, such as the Victor Gadbou Shelter and the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is this large gap in Quebec’s health care system that causes many palliative care practitioners to fear the adoption of a law legalizing euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Beginning in October, a manifesto signed by palliative care lights, Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lyapuant, has been circulating, testifying to their disagreement with such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, Quebec’s health care system is not effective enough to ensure the right to high-quality palliative care before the transition to euthanasia is allowed.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who spent 14 days in the emergency room in terrible pain, and no one took the necessary steps to relieve them.
I'm afraid patients only want to die because they don't get adequate care.
At the same time, many oncologists try to save patients until the last day, despite pessimistic forecasts.
Hopes for Helen Richard's survival were already minimal when she stopped her debilitating chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was stopping treatment, she told me that she was sorry that I was stopping the fight.
She told me that my days were numbered.
There is no omnipotent care.
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who ask to die thank the medical staff for not fulfilling their request after the palliative care team eases their pain.
However, it should be noted that palliative care is not absolutely omnipotent in the fight against pain.
According to Elsie Monroe, director of palliative care at the Greater Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, patients are not susceptible to pain relief in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to palliative sedation, in which the patient sleeps until the moment of his death, either from time to time or constantly.
We can no longer pretend that we do not know about these sufferings.
Increasingly, patients who fail to relieve pain will be able to have access to palliative sedation.
Those who suffer from pain always say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But it doesn’t necessarily mean “I want to be euthanized,” it means “I want to be made easier.”
The creation of this report was made possible by a journalistic grant from the Canadian Institute for Health Research.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec City
Officials in charge of road construction, construction contractors, political party fundraisers, and Italian mafia specialists tell us day after day what they know about the colossal “system” that envelops the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists, and mafiosi.
“Industry” that cost Quebec taxpayers a lot, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It is curious how this system disintegrates after all the funds have been released,” jokes Jacques Duchesne, a member of parliament and former police chief of Montreal.
It was thanks to him that the scandal broke out in 2011 as a by-product of an investigation into official crimes related to road construction contracts in Quebec, to which the then Prime Minister of the Liberals, Jean Charré, agreed very reluctantly.
The Duchenne Report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties, and corruption.
“Since the investigation began in 2010, the Department of Transportation alone would have saved a billion dollars on contracts,” he said, “if some held back their instincts to take a share.”
The Charbonno Commission has "already displaced two mayors", he adds, hoping that it will be able to "open up the schemes behind individual personalities".
Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011
The case was joined by the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit established in 2011, which included a large staff of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
And, in addition, the employees of the special unit "Molot", who after 2009 forced the "waste cartel" of Montreal, to stop overestimating the cost of contracts.
A series of searches have been carried out in recent weeks, and some municipal officials, including Frank Zampino and Richard Markotta, mayor of a small town, have been charged with fraud and corruption.
Next up is Gil Weyancourt, who recently resigned from the post of mayor of Laval, the third largest city in the province of Quebec.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes when placing state orders.
In addition, the official charge was brought against several Montreal’s communications service engineers and construction contractors of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter blew up a real bomb, leading the investigation about the "system" of obtaining state contracts.
For several years, Zambito gave 3% of the value of the contracts concluded in Montreal to some mafia-related intermediary, who in turn transferred money from the party of Mayor Gerald Tramble to the United Montreal.
In the 2000s, Zambito squandered money on the right and left. He transferred more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to various parties in the province, mostly liberals, who were in power at the time.
He also admitted to illegally raising funds for former Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, Natalie Normando.
Sewerage contracts in which the value has been exceeded
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked flawlessly.
Jill Surprenan, a former civil engineering engineer, described it in detail before the commission: for ten years he received from construction firms gifts, invitations to travel, to golf tournaments, to restaurants, to hockey matches and bribes totalling $ 736,000 in exchange for a canal.
Other officials in charge of road construction admitted that they were getting on the paw, overbilling by 30-40% with the help of fake additions.
Then one of the organizers of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tramble of deliberately turning a blind eye to the existence of a parallel budget that filled the party cash registers with dirty money.
After these revelations, Mr. Tramble resigned in early November, plunged Montreal into a deep crisis.
Chantal Rulo was one of the first MPs in Montreal to sound the alarm.
The mayor of the Riviera de Prairie district in the east of the island, she has been resisting since 2010 the sale of a municipal plot bought for $5 million and resold for...1.6 million to builders in the midst of a construction boom.
70% of dirty money in election campaigns
She says that in the investigation, which will eventually be launched, she “will pull the strings to understand how the ants’ nesting system works to stop gangrene and identify the culprits.”
This process she describes as “painful but positive.”
We are in the process of clearing the wound, but Montreal will need its own investigative team and observer to avoid the return of questionable practices.
How do we get home?
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesne notes for his part that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials who knew about this scheme" but did not participate in the machinations.
Given that the share of dirty money in funding an election campaign in Quebec reaches 70 percent, he jokes, “I was told it was just a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to 100 dollars to parties, but, according to him, this will not change the situation: “Until we strictly limit election expenses, there will be dirty money in politics.”
He calls for a complete restructuring of the system of government contracts and party financing: “We cannot go down; by boldly looking into the essence of things, we will be able to build a house on a stronger foundation, with better control and legitimacy.”
If this story casts a shadow over the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesne calls on those who laugh to look into their own backyard.
PSG - not FC Barcelona!
This season, you have achieved an extraordinary extent in PSG.
How would you explain this growth?
This can be explained by individual consciousness, but it can also be explained by a new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
I grow up with them every day.
The technical staff also contributed a lot.
These factors make me raise the level of my game every day.
And during the game, it's easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I'm not burning.
From the very beginning, in the center of preliminary training at the NIF in Clerfontein and until my arrival in St. Etienne, I always stepped forward.
Thus, you benefit from the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer, it is not new to play very high-level matches.
They also know that every workout is very important.
This leads to the fact that a player like me wants to be at the level and get the most out of it.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti supports my positioning.
He is helped by substitutes like Claude Macellele, who played in the same position as me.
Ancelotti - the owner of the position?
Of course.
Ancelotti has the respect of all the technical staff.
Today in the First League he is not equal and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has extensive experience and he has won many titles with high-class clubs.
He worked with great players.
I think he will bring new titles to Paris.
In January, I had an encouraging conversation with him.
Then I walked away from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first season of PSG?
In the First League, Lyon took the position of leader.
But we're still ready.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified effectively for the one-eighth final.
What is the purpose of the club in this tournament?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
We will be able to speak face to face with very good European teams.
We want to finish first in our group, ahead of Porto, to be able to take a rematch in one of the eight finals.
Can PSG become a first-class European club in the short term?
He already has a budget...
In order to become a major European club, Paris needs to win titles and consolidate its position in the long term.
That's not the case today.
Financially, PSG has the means to make this project a reality.
Not to take the title in the First League, like last season, will be a big failure?
Of course, that would be a big disappointment.
This year we really want to win this championship title.
We were close to that last season.
In May, there was disappointment, because we had everything to come to the finish first.
It was a very good season.
We finished with 79 points.
As a rule, 79 points implies the title of champion.
But another team, Montpellier, played an even more fantastic season.
This year, I think everything will be fine.
Despite the fact that such strong teams as Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux have entered the fight for the title, I think we have the strength to win.
Don’t you think the media is expecting too much from PSG?
It is normal that we expect a lot from us, given how much has been invested and what kind of players we have.
We are fully prepared for this.
On the other hand, when we win 4-0 against Troy at home and we still find something to criticize, of course, it’s a little disappointing.
We wonder what people expect from us in the first place.
We will never be able to win every weekend with a 4-0 score.
We're not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to implement a game project.
The team is formed over time.
We have proven in the Champions League that we can respond to modern challenges.
Look at Manchester United, which has not been able to make it to the eighth final for two seasons, even though they have also spent a lot of money!
Taking into account the amounts invested, we represented you 15 points ahead of the winter break.
That would be a disdain for our opponents and for the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not at the height last season, were “excited” by the new PSG.
This shows how exciting the First League is.
I hope that in May we will be able to smile and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have won as a result.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s exploits.
Well, what if they say that there is some kind of "Golden Dependency".
This only means that Ibrahimovic is very successful and that he scores a lot of goals.
He came for it and he proves that he is a star of the First League.
Wherever he played, he showed that he was a great player and a world-class star.
In the group, we respect him as a person and as a player.
He also respects the people around him.
What he did is truly exceptional.
It also encourages others to improve their game.
Tiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motivates everyone to move forward.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
As a disappointment.
I really wanted to be part of this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from tearing up some game time.
I saw a lot of things there, and I came out stronger.
Today I am able to play good qualifying matches.
That's what I've been hoping for since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we must behave in an exemplary manner.
What do you think of Didier Desham’s first months in the lead of Blues?
They are effective for him.
He has a good position in the selection team for the World Cup.
He is a strict coach, he is close to the players and inspires to win.
How was Laurent Blanc?
But I don't want to compare.
Blanc has achieved his goal, he qualified us in Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps brings the Blues to Brazil.
A well-deserved draw (1-1), which took place on October 16 in Spain, is a fundamental match?
This match gave us confidence in ourselves.
Everyone was fighting for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, there were no such matches in my career.
Pay and sell without the help of banks - with Bitcoin
The complete opposite of the current exchange of money based on central banks, numbered transactions between the receiving parties c commission fees for their processing.
In addition, as is often the case with these technologies, there is an obvious political vision: the belief that the current monetary system, consisting of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros ...) and a protected exchange protocol like BitTorrent, which allows you to exchange files between participants of the same level.
About 200,000 operations have already been registered with 15,000 computers on the network.
Several thousand sites accept bitcoins to make donations or as a means of payment.
The bitcoin rate, peaking at $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell five months later to $2 before returning today to about $10 (the rates are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing special compared to the global exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) in its report on virtual currency, published in October, was interested in this system.
He describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as “credits” used to promote a video game, which are earned during the game or which can be bought (and sometimes exchanged).
The social network Facebook has also developed a similar system.
But exchange operations are always controlled and handled by a central body.
In Bitcoin, all the nodes of the network are simultaneously holders of the ledger, auditors, currency issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses, much like an e-mail.
Only for each new payment can the user choose a different address, thus providing anonymity.
The set of information relating to this transaction is signed electronically, using a dual-key encryption system.
The network can also verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is possible to check that the bitcoins used in the transaction actually exist in a public ledger sent across the network.
The key step is to register a new transaction in this book.
It passes through the solution of a mathematical problem sent to computers, which, like a temporary central bank, is given the privilege of adding this new line.
It is a phase of hashing a file, that is, converting a large file into a digital signature, short and unique.
Computers “take” a new transaction and add a number to it before they “hash” it all together.
The goal is to find a number that will give you a unique digital signature (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number is found, other nodes easily check that it is correct.
The transaction thus becomes inextricably linked to the chain of all other transactions; any modification will change the digital signature.
If, in order to deceive the user very quickly (less than ten minutes) would like to pay twice with the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network - and the other would remain unconfirmed, since they have different electronic signatures.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, the reward is regularly split in half, probably by the end of 2012.
The number of Bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided up to one hundred million, which leaves another reserve...
The complexity of the task also increases with the increase in computing power.
The life of the network has already experienced ups and downs.
Sites providing Bitcoin services were attacked, and Bitcoins were stolen from the reserves.
“The defect used does not apply to the protocol itself,” said Pierre Nouza, who recently launched Paymium, a company that makes payments in real money using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of money laundering through this anonymous service.
But cash also has this drawback.
Major players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blog platform, allow them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and found that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
"Giant Sales" was announced in November.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” rejoices Jon Holmqvist, who works at Coinabul, which is engaged in the conversion of bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Nouza, another author of this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as an operational network.
Its system, Paytunia, is the equivalent of a credit card (in real money) or contactless payment via a mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions, which is thus cheaper.
The owner better controls his personal data and can thus be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement for entrepreneurs who do not need to install new devices or software.
It is enough to communicate the address, which can be "photographed and recognized" by phone, Pierre Nouza specifies, assuring that he already has thousands of users.
There is a general tendency to revise hierarchical systems in favor of more horizontal ones.
“Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
By the way, the ECB’s report envisages reviewing the various risks that are considered to be elevated today if this system is successful.
We're out of Afghanistan.
What's next?
French troops have left their zone of responsibility in Afghanistan (Cape and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
The time has come for the Afghan army to regain control of its territory, and for the Afghans to choose their future without relying solely on us.
We were mainly affected by Afghan peasants, whom we considered terrorists.
And we ourselves, with 88 killed soldiers, and wounded and crippled.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former commanders hiding in Pakistan, but also often peasants who reject the presence of a foreign army, as it was under the USSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and archaic, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tajiks.
They are tolerated, sometimes helped by local insurgents, but they will be gone as soon as the West behaves more delicately.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the heights of the hills planted with almond trees thanks to French loans, went well.
Convoys of trucks and armored vehicles accompanied by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
As of the end of 2014, there will be no Taliban invasion of Kabul.
Circumstances have changed since their insurmountable progress from 1994 to 1996.
At that time, Kabul was empty, the country was on fire and blood because of the struggle between different groups.
Their takeover of the country was then perceived as a kind of liberation, a return to security.
Afghan women have paid for the obscurity of these peasants, in which they were overtaken by al-Qaida, but their situation has not improved to this day.
The former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban are united in their desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main characters of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into dealers seizing state lands to resell them for construction to repatriates returning from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of huge US subcontracting contracts.
They are discredited; most of them, by the way, did not even fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have succeeded in American generosity: the outflow of capital is significant.
Young people are tired of war and its ideology.
They lived in the modern world during the exile in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated its advantages.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; there are now 5 million inhabitants in Kabul, one fifth of the total population.
Public schools in the cities are filled with both boys and girls.
It is necessary to provide jobs for these young people who do not want to return to the obscurity of the old parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including armed militants, loves mobile phones, television and Turkish soap operas, which represent the modern world and which look everywhere.
There is an army now.
Will the authorities that will command it be considered legitimate?
The old commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already taking steps to restore the provincial wives who would not obey the central government.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local differences, must be to some extent decentralized, modeled on Western countries, but the United States wanted to turn it into a centralized state with strong presidential power, eliminating the post of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, especially before the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But his country, since the 1950s, and even earlier, depends on foreign aid.
The industry has not been put on its feet, no dam is functioning, no irrigation system has been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except vegetables and fruits.
Priority is given to a private initiative.
In a country devastated by thirty years of war, state control of infrastructure would be necessary.
There have been rumours that Afghanistan has huge mineral wealth.
This only increased the feeling that Western countries were present there, only to conquer them.
Without the energy to process iron ore or copper on the spot, without the means of transportation to export them through the mountains, there is no extraction of minerals.
The Chinese have already almost left the Mes Aynak copper field, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to dig up a huge Buddhist complex and remain the province’s largest employers.
It is also necessary that one day Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports depend to a large extent, should restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of the French combat units ended on November 20.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the preservation of traditional assistance: high school for girls, for boys, the French language faculty at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in an effort to "conquer hearts and minds" and to fulfill the impossible task of combining assistance with offensive operations, the service of "military-civilian activity" under the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), abolished in 2012, together with a small French public organization, the way
These works, with the intensive involvement of the local labor force, were able to help contain the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, protection of soils and increasing the area of arable land.
What will we leave in our memory if we spend two billion euros on military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to improving the living conditions of the local population, very harsh in these valleys, often located at an altitude of more than 2,000 meters above sea level.
The Embassy has received dozens of written requests for small-scale agricultural work from local communities in the province of Capis.
To get rid of the uprisings led by foreign groups, which the farmers want, as they told me, you need to provide them with a little non-military support, which would be well controlled and would come to them directly.
Births of the Constitution of Egypt
This is a new risky step by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever, on the issue of a constitutional declaration that temporarily gives it extraordinary powers, it has decided to play va-bank.
To everyone’s surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote on the final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state gave the Assembly two additional months to complete the work.
For almost two years now, Egypt has relied on a preliminary text, which has been amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative only strengthened the country’s division.
According to his opponents, the President persists in his "autocratic delusion", continuing to "violate this word" and "violate the law".
In the camp of his followers, they are convinced that this is a way to end the institutional and political crisis by accelerating the transition process.
The referendum must be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time, which forces the Brethren to abandon the intention to explain to the Egyptians the text, the article after the article.
For the president, it is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while discontent rages across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote in favor, as he told the American weekly Time in an interview.
Moreover, the call for an accelerated vote resembles an ultimatum to the Egyptian people: “Either you vote for my text, or I leave to myself extraordinary powers”, which are supposed to be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this strange atmosphere, 85 members of the Constituent Assembly, mostly Islamists, voted yesterday for the text.
Most liberals have not responded to the challenge.
In mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they knocked on the door, feeling unable to give their opinion.
Representatives of human rights defenders, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
To achieve the required quorum, 11 alternate participants were hastily added yesterday morning.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Not surprisingly, in most cases, the articles were voted unanimously.
The commentators, by the way, were distracted by the fact that one of the few disagreements of the day arose around...time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the Hours of the Constituent Assembly were wrongly tuned.
The text, which was voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
The subject of universal attention, article 2 ultimately remained the same article from the 1971 Constitution, which stated that "the principles of sharia are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for which the implementation of Islamic law is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace the "principles" with "rules" that would allow them to be applied more strictly.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a testament to their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy,” say the liberals, who only see it as a PR.
Because, in their opinion, the Islamization of the Constitution occurs through other articles.
They point in particular to article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egypt expert Sophie Pomier, this is alarming, because “people who are called to make decisions are not elected and do not have any democratic legitimacy.”
We can see the birth of theocracy.”
Many liberals, moreover, are agitated by the fact that the next rector of this university seems to be far less moderate than the current one.
“At the moment, there is no specific religious intervention.
With this constitution, we remain within the framework of civil law.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not ulema, but people with a university education, some have studied in the French system,” says Alexis Bloe, who is preparing a dissertation on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he admits that “there may be ambiguities around Article 220, as the terms used in it are borrowed from religious lexicon.
This applies in particular to the “fiqh” [Islamic jurisprudence].
And in the future, there may be a question of how competent civil judges are to make decisions about this.”
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is subject to criticism as it gives broad powers to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim brothers claim that they have significantly reduced compared to what they were under the old regime.
Another controversial point: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the consideration of the defense budget will be held not in the Parliament, but in the National Defense Council.
Nor will the trial of civilians in military courts be prohibited, despite requests from human rights associations.
The latter also expressed concern about the text, which they considered to be detrimental to freedom.
Responsibility for blasphemy remains, and insults are now prohibited, which can have serious consequences for freedom of speech, and especially for freedom of the press.
In addition, none of the articles speaks anymore about the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Moraef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture in article 36.
A word that did not appear in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was due to speak on television last night, the demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state, in turn, will take to the streets on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for holy places, the Pup of the Earth and the sea from the brine
The Promised Land combines the grandeur of biblical truths, modern comfort and the primacy of nature.
The AIF has identified five of the most important reasons to visit Israel.
Let's Worship the Holy Places
It is worth visiting the Jordan River, in which Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that for all who enter this "couple", the grace of God diminishes.
And Galilee is the place of the miracles of Jesus: turning the water into wine at the wedding feast, walking on the water, calming the storm and filling the nets.
Here Jesus appeared before the disciples and after the resurrection.
But most of all, the sanctuary in Jerusalem.
Believers here pass through the Way of Sorrow or the Cross of Jesus (in Latin - Via Dolorosa).
It begins at the fortress of Antony - Pretoria - where there was a court, and on the streets of the Old City leads to the Temple of the Tomb of the Lord on Mount Golgotha - to the place of the Crucifixion, the Stone of the anointing and the place of the burial of Jesus.
Here is the symbolic Christian Pup of the Earth, symbolizing the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem will be built in the place where, according to Christian legend, the tree grew, from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the holiest place for Jews - the Wall of Tears, left over from the temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave here notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Make a journey through the vertical
The ruins of the fortress of Massad remained from a secret refuge from enemies, which Herod the Great built in 25 BC for his family.
They are located on steep cliffs in the mountains at an altitude of 450 m above sea level.
And only those who are interested in mountaineering can reach them with their own pace.
The rest on this historical peak is delivered by a lift on a cable car.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, on which in the winter months - a huge influx of tourists.
To him from the foot of the mountain delivers a shuttle bus.
The total length of the ski runs is 45 km.
According to ancient tradition, there were supposedly pagan gods living on the top of the mountain.
Visiting unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
You can't go on one trip at all.
But at least five of them, the most interesting, are worth visiting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the oldest Cumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in the caves of the Jewish desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
It is also worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his exposition are widely presented paintings of impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cezanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall, Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the Al Basha Bath Museum, which represents several halls of ancient Turkish baths with paintings of visitors and bathers of the time.
In Caesarea it is worth entering the unique partial Rally Museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Dali and Rodin.
There are no tour guides and souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth – the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv – tells of one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section - a children's memorial - is built in memory of 1.5 million children destroyed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter it and you find yourself in absolute darkness.
They beat the stars.
And the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is mentioned there as well.
Rejoice
Israel’s three main resort areas are located on the shores of the Mediterranean, Red and Dead Seas.
Each of them has pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Interestingly, the Red Sea is bathed even in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not drop below 21 degrees of heat, and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The dead sea is even warmer, and they swim there all year round.
By the way, this is the most unusual sea in the world is at the lowest point on the planet - 417 m below sea level.
The azure water in it is a brine that easily holds on to the float even those who do not know how to swim at all.
The scenery around it is unreal.
They come here to undergo a course of treatment with the use of salt water - rapeseed, and curative dirt, and to cure health in dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes mellitus, to put in order the weakened nerves.
Touching the secrets of antiquity
They are kept by the ancient part of Tel Aviv - the town of Jaffo on the shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
Through it passed the famous Sea Route, connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom they lived a long and happy life.
Tourists love to wander through the narrow streets named after the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you lean against the walls on the street "your" sign, Fortune will become favorable.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds coming from all over Israel and even other countries for photo shoots.
And in Caesarea - the city of King Herod - you can wander through the Roman theater, "take" the fortress of the Crusaders.
During the Roman period, Caesarea was the capital of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for evening concerts and opera performances.
Tourist on the note
When traveling to Israel, do not worry about your imperfect English: in the country about 30% of the population know Russian.
It is better to take money on the trip not in euros, but in dollars, which are easy to exchange for shekels (now 1 dollar - 3.8 shekels).
Urban transport is mostly buses, but Jerusalem has a high-speed tram, and Haifa is the only metro line in the country, consisting of six stations and connecting the Lower City with the Upper.
Actually, it's an underground funicular.
Travel in all types of urban transport costs 6 shekels, for which you can travel with transfers for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sundown on Saturday, markets, shops, public transport stop working.
On Sunday mornings, the working week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels - only kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, shellfish and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There are a large selection of dishes made from lamb and beef, soups and desserts made with coconut milk, traditional Jewish hummus paste, a variety of sauces, balls of ground nut - phallel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are a lot of fed cats, which valiantly "walk by themselves".
In the evening, they can be seen sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
Murliks love popular places and do not give up treats.
Car rental, depending on the brand, will cost from $ 37 per day (Hyundai Getz) to 188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Plus the insurance is $15 a day.
And the bike rental will cost 15 shek. per day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
The Language of Numbers
In 2012, Israel was visited by more than three million tourists from all over the world.
Most to travel and rest came citizens of the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, which is 51% more than the same figure in 2010, until the cancellation of visas on February 9, 2011.
“Great and powerful” will lead to Moscow: migrants save money on language
While deputies and human rights defenders argue that the law on mandatory language testing will give, fraudsters have already appeared in the country, trading in "lip" certificates
Every year 13 million guest workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support families left behind in their homeland.
Since December 1, the law has entered into force, according to which every labor migrant will be required to pass the examination for knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this rule only applies to those who intend to work in the field of services, housing and utilities, housing and retail.
However, over time, the FMS promises, the tests will become mandatory for all visitors.
It will be necessary to hand over not only the language, but also the Russian history, and the foundations of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language will have to be confirmed both to obtain and to extend the work permit.
The exception applies only to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Not subject to the law and people who managed to obtain certificates and diplomas of education before the collapse of the USSR in 1991.
Use, Conviction and Protection of Rights
The network of examination points will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the University of Friendship of Peoples, MSU, SPbSU and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to pass the tests in all cities; already in Russia more than 160 such centers have opened.
The initiative to introduce testing was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the FMS.
But human rights defenders, before the law came into force, many times managed to ask the press: what will it actually give?
What will change the obligation to know the language for Russians and for the visitors themselves?
First of all, - answered the representatives of the migration service, - this will reduce the number of people suffering from "labour slavery".
A lot of people are now talking about protecting the rights of labor migrants, explains the head of the representation of the FMS of Russia in Tajikistan Viktor Sebelev.
The protection of their rights must begin before they leave.
Only the system of organized recruitment will allow 90% to solve the problems of foreign workers.
Problems arise in migrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language, who do not have a medical examination.
Without understanding the language, the future migrant is doomed to face unscrupulous people who, under the guise of help, will shove him "trip" into a terrible narrow barrack, where he and dozens of people like him will spend months without food and documents, inciting 12-14 hours a day.
We get a lot of complaints from our migrants.
"They are promised one thing at home, and on arrival they are cheated, passports are taken away, they do not pay the promised salary," Tolib Sharipov, head of the Chief of Labour Migration Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Tajikistan, confirmed.
Don't argue, settler!
However, while many citizens of the Central Asian republics who are going to make money in Russia admit that they not only do not know the language of the country in which they aspire, but also write on their own with difficulty.
Of course, it is not so much their fault as the trouble: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tajiks can afford to get even an intelligent primary education.
After all, their families have nothing to feed their children, not to mention to dress them properly, put on shoes and equip them for school.
Growing up to adolescence, such guys at the first opportunity are sent to earnings.
It's hard if you don't know the language, they admit.
“You feel humiliated and undervalued.”
However, with regard to the law on language, human rights defenders note one important point.
The test will be conducted only for those migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no exam or subsequent official work.
Meanwhile, most of the guest workers still live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome, or Foreign entry is prohibited"
Many of the visitors claim that getting official status in our country is not so easy.
The reason is in bureaucratic hurdles and all the same language difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: from 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
But a fake registration can be done quickly and for only half a thousand.
Employees of the Russian police know that we have mostly fake documents, there is no registration, hence the cases of extortion.
“A hundred, two for cigarettes, tea will be asked,” Umed Khuskadamov, a citizen of Tajikistan, told reporters.
"Fly, don't buy, buy painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the law on language, it became clear that not only migrant registration documents are fake.
Several "lipo" certificates of passing language tests have already been withdrawn by FMS employees.
Fake papers are printed on a regular color printer.
Of course, they got the new owners not in vain: each of the migrants, hoping to facilitate the task of passing the tests in this way, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two times more expensive than the official testing procedure: it will cost a labor migrant three thousand.
The main task in the near future is to protect the system from corruption, so that "shortcuts" can not be just bought, both representatives of the government and human rights defenders agree.
While the authorities can promise guest workers who have not successfully passed the test from the first time, it is time to study the basic language course.
In addition, visitors who do not know Russian will be offered work in areas that do not involve active communication with people.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs does not take into account the illegal arms market
The proportion of crimes involving the use of legal weapons is extremely small
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia proposes to tighten the law on the owners of civilian weapons.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: Press shots at weddings, when it was without victims, and the massacre, organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, which resulted in the death of seven people.
Police want to ban the use of trauma in public places and raise the age from which a gun license can be obtained - from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption Irina Yarovaya and promised that amendments to the law on weapons will be made to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is satisfied with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by “twisting the nuts”.
An open letter appeared in the network, the authors of which - representatives of various public small organizations - demand to abandon the "meaningless tightening".
The percentage of hooliganism with registered weapons is minimal, criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov told the Russian service of the BBC.
According to statistics of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, in the six months of 2012, 142 crimes were committed with the use of firearms registered in the internal affairs bodies, while in the same period 1,168,000 crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are confident that tightening legislation in the field of civilian weapons does not place the criminal to go to the "black" market.
Now, according to them, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry claims to control the situation with the spread of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The “black” arms market is replenished through several channels.
The main five such channels, says retired Colonel Viktor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the structure of the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of the site that accepts orders for weapons
The first is an “army or military trace”, that is, a weapon that was stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were drawn by Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves,” says Baranets.
The next type of "black weapons" is stolen by criminals from representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes both stolen from police warehouses and stolen from law enforcement officers directly.
Illegal “guns” go on sale from military warehouses.
In many military warehouses, there were frequent explosions.
"There are proven versions that some of the fires were made specifically to cover up the shortage," the former military official said.
According to Barantz, the weapons manufacturers are importing their lepta.
“Now there are private weapons factories that do not withstand competition in the international market and throw weapons from the ground to the black market, including Moscow,” the expert said.
Another source of the “black” market is smuggling.
In particular, there are a lot of guns and assault rifles coming from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is its production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia was formed that organized the flow,” explains the former military.
Where'd the gun come from?
Experts have estimated the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of illegal weapons to the “black” market.
This report was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Public Administration Design.
Specialists analyzed the reporting of the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Rosstat, criminological literature and open data portals on weapons issues.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers write, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market were there "because of officials whose work is related to weapons," the report said.
According to the researchers, 17% of the cases of weapons come from places of armed conflict, in 14% of cases there are thefts at the stage of production of weapons, 5% belong to the "black archaeology".
The salesman-consultant of one of the gun shops, who asked not to mention his name, assures that the weapons found by black miners, no one buys for a long time - too old.
Most often, as he says, behind the new party, sellers go to the military warehouse.
Through the flag, a person buys a unit, such as a TT gun.
He's being written off, handed over through the lock.
“He takes it to the city and sells it here for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>900 a piece with two shops,” he says.
"The truth is, the police are aware of all the cases, so periodically when a plan for the detection of crimes is burning, they carry out a control purchase from dealers with illegal weapons," the consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
The seller and the buyer most often find each other through acquaintances.
I looked at the sites, the blogs, until a friend who offered to come to the platform “Begovaya”, where there will be a person who will take me to the “corner”, where we will trade.
The price of the gun I only knew there.
Military Reviewer Viktor Baranets
To get the gun, I need a friend who has a way out, - says the sales consultant. - I have such a friend, but I'm not sure about it.
There are sellers in the markets, but you also need to come there, conditionally, "from Ivan Ivanovich, who asked to convey that his daughter's tooth fell out."
I'm even getting a couple of castes through a guy I'm sure of right now.
He also supplies them only to me, because he knows that I will not give them up.
Newbies are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranets tried himself as a buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was preparing to publish an article about it.
The plans, he said, have not changed.
He was given a photo album, where there was "anything".
“I felt like I was in a luxury store,” the soldier recalls.
The buyer, according to Barantz, is not offered a cat in a bag - everything can be tried.
I, a potential customer, don't just buy - we go with the seller to the forest, we set a target there.
“I’m given the opportunity to shoot, and when I’m convinced that the weapon is hitting well, we start trading,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shop on the sofa
Search engines on the Internet take to sites and groups in "Vkontakte", where they offer to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are needed for this.
"It is enough to have a certain amount of money," - write in the advertising hat on the site "Buy a gun or a machine gun."
On it, users leave their requests and ask questions.
Will it be sold to minors?
"Without a license of course", - asks the user "Ivan" (the spelling is preserved).
"I buy T.T.Moscow" - laconically formulates the request "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has now deployed a huge network of paratroopers and those who want to buy weapons of war with a shovel.
People go like a hungry fish for food, and then they extract coal in Siberia.

I have heard about such schemes: usually the site is registered outside of the Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes a payment through an ATM.
“In response, they send a photo and an instruction where the weapons are hidden,” said Dmitry Kislov, a spokesman for the public organization “Right to Arms”.
Victor Baranets claims that leaving the application on the site, you can remain without weapons and get behind the bars.

Makarov for 100 dollars
When buying illegal small arms, according to experts, you can settle in the amount from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Right to Arms", Makarov's gun can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
We'll have to wait a month and a half.
It is shipped from long-term storage warehouses by the management of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to official statistics, compared to January-October 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia as a whole decreased by 7% and amounted to 22.9 thousand, and the number of revealed facts of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the United States, workers of fast food and supermarkets are beaten
Through work at the ticket office "Macdonalds" passes to a quarter of all American teenagers
In recent days, there has been a wave of protests against low wages in Walmart department stores and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
Until then, no one is going to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or it is destined to die out in the early stages.
The actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing public organizations.
In addition to raising the modest salaries that ordinary Walmart workers and the fast food system receive, the goal of protest organizers is to create trade union organizations in them.
So far, this sector of the economy is almost not covered by the trade union movement.
46 cents a year?
The action began last week, after Thanksgiving, on the so-called “Black Friday,” when an orgy of cheap sales collapsed on America, capturing millions of residents and sometimes accompanied by riots.
On this day, some employees of Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and picketed with trade unions and left-wing activists the stores of the corporation, whose goods are intended for people of modest and medium wealth.
Walmart sells everything in the world, from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in its stores are on average from 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many of Walmart’s low-wage workers only get paid at work.
The availability and range of products made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to critics, Walmart can afford to sell goods at a discount in part because it pays its employees little.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, for example, the lack of forklifts or manual scanners.
Shareholders in Black Friday demanded an increase in wages and said the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation had jumped from $30 to $100 a month.
The typical Walmart worker, who gets $9.5 an hour, this expense is not in his pocket, they said.
Scientists from the University of California at Berkeley prove that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 billion.
That’s about 1.1% more than she spends on her salary right now.
If Walmart completely shifts the growth of wages on the shoulders of buyers, then every visit to the store will cost them only 46 cents more.
In a year, they will spend about $12.39 more than they do now.
Walmart’s supporters say the protests have occurred in only nine states and have not caused any damage to the corporation.
Black Friday continued in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day, during which time Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers produced almost 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
Dan Fogelman, a spokesman for the corporation, told the Huffington Post that fewer than five Walmart employees had left their jobs in total, and that the protest was just another “piarous trick” by the union that organized it.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York City, where their object was not Walmart department stores (they are not complaining in this progressive city, and therefore they are not here yet), and McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s says it sells billions of servings, and after that it doesn’t even give you hospitals or pay you for honest work!
Julien Williams, Member of the New York City Council
At the moment, the minimum wage, according to federal and New York law, is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants raise it over time, but not much, and on average their regular workers get $8.90 an hour in New York City.
No one earns less in this expensive city.
How it is possible to exist in New York for such money, for me it is incomprehensible.
Once, a quarter of American teenagers who worked behind their backs after school, while living with their parents, passed through the McDonald’s.
Few saw this as the main source of food or planned to stay there for a long time.
Right now I’m constantly coming across interviews with McDonald’s employees who complain that they have to live on that salary and sometimes even feed their children on it.
On the other hand, on the forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment, the author of which notes that it is irresponsible to raise children if you do not know what you will feed them.
Protesters, who began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and fast food cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, more than doubling their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that trade union organizations be set up in the field of fast food.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from obstructing and punishing trade union activists with harassment and dismissal.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But it is difficult to cover fast food by the trade union for objective reasons.
One of the main ones is the unusual flow of personnel.
Disagreement
Loud protests took place on that day and at a number of other cheap restaurants in Manhattan.
The culmination of the action was a mid-day rally at McDonald's near Times Square, where several local Democratic politicians spoke, in particular, a member of the Council of Governors, Julien Williams, who said: "Macdonalds" says he sells billions of portions to you, and then he doesn't even give you a job.
Other prominent New York Democrats supported the protesters, such as City Mayor Bill De Blasio, who said that "we must join hands in supporting fast food workers so that they get the fair pay and economic well-being every New Yorker deserves!"
As the New York Times described it, it was the largest such action in the history of the American fast food industry.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, and not all of them were workers of fast food, which in New York employed tens of thousands of people.
It is not yet clear whether this spark will spark a flame of mass movement.
"Until the brain is tricked, it's average."
Popular among fans of modern technologies, the topic of augmented reality has recently been accepted mainly through the prism of special glasses.
First, Google showed the current model at its annual conference in the summer, and then in November it became known that the application for the corresponding patent was also filed by Microsoft.
However, from a conversation with the head of the interactive 3D technology group at the Cambridge laboratory of Microsoft, Sharam Izadi, it follows that for the scientists of this company glasses is the stage passed.
They are seduced by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Please tell me, in general terms, what is your research team doing?
- We are engaged in human-machine interaction, but at the same time we are trying to push the boundaries of this interaction.
While humanity in the mass is stuck at the stage of working with pixels on the flat screen, sometimes typos in them with a finger.
We also want to look 5-10 years ahead and anticipate radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without Kinect is not sold, because everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else is ahead?
Despite the fact that Kinect has moved the interaction to the physical level, a lot still happens on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is not very much yet.
We are trying to change this, we are working on truly three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projective ones.
We need to let the computer world into our physical world, make it more tangible.
To do this, however, you need to recognize not only the user, but also the space around him.
Then we can complement the real world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form.
And first of all - to hell with these stupid virtual reality helmets!
What do you think about voice control?
It's a popular thing, but isn't it overrated?
- It definitely can not be called a panacea - the question of privacy arises, because it does not always want to inform others about their actions and intentions.
In fact, all kinds of interactions with computers are good, but each in its own niche.
For example, for the management of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about swaggering, but about such clumsy, short ones.
At the same time, the gestures were taken not by the camera of the device, but by a wristband, which fixed the movements of the bones and muscles.
While it is large, but theoretically it can be reduced to the size of the wristwatch.
But in general, the future behind a mixed type of control, for example, gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this soda can?
You will say and show at the same time.
- I usually just talk.
- Oh, it's gonna be very hard to tell.
- So you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or can not at the moment?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will mainly have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to more accurately determine human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they give a good resolution in depth, this is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what are your claims to modern cameras?
Lack of depth, depth, or anything else?
- In principle, the current generation is something that can be pushed back in our work on three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get megapixels 8 at a speed of 1000 c / s.
But it’s not about the megapixels themselves, but as a matrix and depth.
From the last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us - it adds work to the designers of algorithms.
That is, it is necessary to remember not only about the resolution of the X and Y axes, but also Z.
Also very important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and the current 30 cc is frankly small, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes from our Redmond laboratory made a touch sensor with adjustable processing delay - from 1 to 100 ms, with modern serial sensors closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between humans and machines.
I would have been very useful in my work the equivalent of such a device, only not requiring touch, so that the frame per second was more.
- Don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared emitter, and the second - a receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is, in fact, the usual sensor of the visible range.
It is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially more cameras could solve the problem...
Or make it worse by increasing the required amount of calculations.
It would be nice to create a flexible analogue of Kinect, play with the curvature of the cameras and see how it will help in three-dimensional definition of the position.
As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that in terms of everyday use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most promising platforms?
- Of course, all the time walking around, holding a smartphone in your hands is not very convenient, but here's what I think: the coolest option would be a "transitional" augmented reality, when based on the cloud platform you could switch from glasses to a smartphone, a projection screen and so on.
Glasses are a very personal device, this is their power (private things see only you), and at the same time weakness - augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to a mere mortal.
There is one problem that is often pointed out by critics of such an idea: there is no tactile feedback!
My hands don't feel anything!
What are your team’s responses to this challenge?
In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth may well be the addition of tactile sensations.
So far, one of the interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a kind of substrate for the image.
It registers the clicks very well!
But there are also technologies that are really aimed at giving these “pictures in the air” touchability – for example, the interference of several directional ultrasounds at a certain point where the finger is located gives a feeling, but for now it is very weak – as if you were put on a pillow.
There are wristbands that affect the nerve endings in the fingers - also a promising direction.
Have you tried to fool your brain?
To make him think that he feels what he’s supposed to feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another task that has to fight for a long time - how to make a person physically in a very limited space, to believe that he is going on an open, almost infinite - we are also working on concepts of running paths (not at all like in clubs), moving platforms, as well as huge piles.
While deceiving the brain turns out to be average, the work is still very many years.
That’s what makes working on virtual reality so appealing to the researcher – many things in an absolutely incipient state.
Taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
“Rosbalt” continues the project “St. Petersburg Avant-garde”, dedicated to the citizens who are in front, in the vanguard of culture and art.
This top list has already included prominent figures of the art scene of St. Petersburg, whose achievements go beyond the city, often finding recognition in Europe, bypassing all-Russian fame.
The new hero of "Rosbalta" is the stunning artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller - a bearded man, dressed in all red, who is found at the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden, and at fashionable parties and vernissages.
The paintings of Kirill Miller always gather crowds of spectators wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of the purely St. Petersburg socio-philosophical fables, the creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a bright man of the St. Petersburg avant-garde of the late 80's - early 90's.
In addition, he is a person of the city, his appearance on the streets causing a smile from the citizens, raising everyone's mood.
Recently, he took a charmer in his hand and became a St. Petersburg charmer, as he matured for this difficult role with all his bohemian existence, philosophy and image.
- Kirill, why are you still walking around the city in all the red, not in yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose red color as a model, engaged in the look and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the artist, the image-maker, and society.
Although in society everything that is almost gray, causes aggression and arousal of bad property.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole history of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- At the exhibition in DK Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I knew it was my way.
Then the wave of old free unofficial artists passed, and new, free types of me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the artists of the new wave, with the post-gazonevshchyna, which led to Pushkinskaya 10, and there was no more wave.
He throws me in the theater, clothes, music, in all genres except the word.
- And all this has come together in your Art Clinic... - It was important to me to be in the center of the culture of St. Petersburg, where all the best creative forces must come together.
In 1995 I occupied the territory on Pushkinskaya-10, and there, until there was a repair, there was a music and art club, a bohemian club, a house of St. Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: NOMs, Tekila-jaz, I remember how Shnura was brought up with the project "Ear of Van Gogh".
The string and his friends sang light songs under the banner, they were in a tightening tricot, among them was the fashionable now composer Igor Vdovin.
When the band played live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was the leader of many programs before the Hali-Haliv times.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and his great career went, and he received basic education and education from us.
Gallery "D 137", club "Griboyedov - are echoes from the Art Clinic.
That's where our employees and forever have gone.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In 2000, the poll was in the press, the prize was "People of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was named, my culmination ended.
In the new times it is uncomfortable to work according to the old rules, I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our years it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are divided, you can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is in a recognizable way.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they have a pronounced relevance and sharpness.
I'm going to have a show called Russian Museum in Clowns.
Clowns are a temporary category.
I used to be sociable, now being so is painful and scary.
But in clowns everything is smeared, tragedy is removed.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through totalitarian disguise in the order of the story.
Now on clothes meet, focusing on the external mechanics, and not on the internal person.
And maybe you can't give him a hand and spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed with the help of disguise.
And recently we've seen you play the role of the city's charmer.
To whom, if not to me, they should be.
- Well, maybe commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art should be neat, tactful, sweet.
There is a disintegration of cultures.
In the past, people were in flocks, bohemians loved one thing, simple people loved another.
Now everyone has broken into micro-communities, now it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar piece of paper for everyone to like.
Now you have to think about who you're going to like.
Now, each cult hero has 100 fans.
- And on Stas Mikhailov comes a few thousand!
- He's got tossers, and that's where the sex and social sphere works.
And on the cultural ground 300 people will come, and 10 thousand will not come, and in the end less management, money, everything will sneeze.
I have fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to spoil the gained.
When I was young, I wrote paintings that had one collector hanging on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually end.
Now, concepts are often confused.
They say: spiritual culture, culture of consumption.
There is no culture of consumption, it is from another opera.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, grew up on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, gave up money for painting.
I'm in favor of that culture.
- Kirill, what is St. Petersburg lacking?
- Good cultural experts.
There is such a thing as an official of culture.
However, not all of them have a culture.
With the right kings everything was not so, kings may not have understood much in culture, but they understood that you need to keep the right experts.
There are good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who could be experts, but they are biased, because we need higher experts who will correctly evaluate these experts and give them a path.
The taste buds are thriving now.
The same Erarta, but they are distinguished by the fact that they honestly say that not all modern art we accept, there are such artists who should look for themselves other museums.
- What's the matter with you, St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is soil.
And on our stones, art is difficult to grow.
We need cultural soil, and we now have more writers than readers, that’s not right.
Here in Europe a lot of people curious. who go to exhibitions, concerts.
We have this thin layer.
We need to make fashion art, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project was implemented on the funds of St. Petersburg grant
Born in Space
The earth is in danger.
Global warming or a collision with an asteroid-killer.
Caravans of spaceships with earthlings on board go in search of a spare planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question arises, how to continue your race in conditions of weightlessness or on the same spare planet?
I think the choice is small.
In fact, the real planets are only two that can be mastered at least hypothetically.
"It's Venus and Mars," said Vladimir Surdin, a senior scientist at the State Astronomical Institute named after P.K. Sternberg.
But if conditions on Mars are more suitable for life, then on the surface of Venus - the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
Approaching the issues of reproduction in space began with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments were conducted on plants.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit were no different from their terrestrial varieties.
Then - the removal in orbit of insects, tiny fruit flies-drosophila.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to check how the embryo develops in conditions of weightlessness.
We get a perfectly normal bird.
But then the problem begins.
“The problem is that this bird has to find support, it has to stand on its feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems (IMBP) of the RAS.
Unable to find the resistance, the birds squabbled indiscriminately.
And after 10 hours, the newborns had a complete atrophy of instincts.
The birds did not respond to light or sound.
And the trouble was, after four days, they just died.
"And twice we hatched birds, then refused, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," - Vladimir Sychev notes the failure of the experiment with birds in space.
With animals, the last time a biological "minivan" flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, on the biosatellite "Bion" will be only same-sex individuals.
There was an experiment with rats that were sent into space already with the fetus.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found there.
"It was just on biosatellites, but again - it is a single experiment, and such research should be carried out," - said Vladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
But to approach the problem of reproduction directly in space is not yet possible.
It's not an easy task.
Animals, losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instincts.
Unlike animals, humans, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, and is able to create a proper emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
Tereshkova had the greatest risk.
And the most precious thing that mankind has is a female body.
Our Chaika flew away, and no one on Earth could have said whether it would survive after flying into space.
Will she be able to have a baby after this flight?
"Because no one has answered this question," says veteran of the rocket and space industry Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just a year after the flight into space, the first female cosmonaut Valentina Tereshkova gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child Andriyan Nikolaev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitska, who had twice been in orbit and even worked in outer space, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk remains.
We have few, there are units of astronauts, who after long flights everything has cost, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," concludes the cosmonaut pilot, Hero of the Soviet Union, Hero of Russia Valery Polyakov.
And yet, humanity needs to look for some new avenues in biotechnology, radiation protection, the creation of artificial gravity.
CPC hydrolaboratory is a mandatory stage of preparation for flight.
Here, in the conditions of zero buoyancy, astronauts work out the skills of working in open space.
Water imitates weightlessness.
If for adults water, although comfortable, but still a foreign environment, then for breast children - a native element.
Small ichthyanders seem to confirm that life on land came out of the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months old with the mother in the fetal fluid, it is easier for him to get used to the watermelon later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth, from the moment of the first bath, only 2 weeks pass.
“It’s very little to forget something,” says breaststroke instructor Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a born child, then for a woman - gravity, the force of gravity is necessary.
Very quickly in weightlessness the muscles of the abdomen, pelvis, drops the ability to push the fetus.
All right, let's get this down to the stimulators of labor.
You can, of course, go to childbirth in a special chamber, she will push him out.
"And then what?" - asks nontrivial questions Valeriy Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the attraction of the earth, the body will not form a skeleton and a muscular system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible, as an adult, to wear a special load suit for training.
He will simply be deprived of what he will need in life.
"And this experiment, which we will go to with you, allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the fact that we will bring to Earth a disabled, completely unadapted person," - predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the RAS Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is a matter of theory.
However, in time, this will become a reality when the Earthlings on their ships go to a distant planet that will become home to their descendants born in space.
Head of the Main Control and Audit Department: The inspection of the blacksmith system failed due to the fault of politicians.
In the public procurement sector, the Czech Republic has good control bodies and, despite the presence of quality legislation, lags behind in its application.
This is a statement by Miroslav Kal, Vice-President of the Supreme Audit Office, from an interview for the website Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
“The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack,” Kala commented on the current situation.
Such conclusions are provided by a joint inspection of the Czech and German control bodies.
As an example of incorrect practice, the approach of Peter Nechas to the so-called Schwartz system is given.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP (Civil Democratic Party) will not bother entrepreneurs with checks – is this prohibited or allowed?
“The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, then the Prime Minister can not oppose the work of the institutions, which are entrusted with the duty to verify and enforce the obligations,” – states Kala.
At the meeting of the audit committee in the Chamber of Deputies, you discussed a joint project between the Czech and German sides, within which the legislation on public procurement of both countries was compared.
What was it specifically about?
This is a parallel check that we started, probably two years ago.
Put simply, the fact that European legislation affirms how public procurement should be carried out is followed by national legislation and then also by application in practice.
All the information was collected and, even with an unfinished check, interesting differences were found - in simple terms, the legislation we have can be "accurate and flawless", but in practice we are inferior to Germany by some parameters.
It follows that it is not enough to create more and more precise rules, it is necessary to focus on the application of the law itself.
How can this project help you, what does it mean to you?
It is this joint monitoring that can contribute to efforts to stop the clarification of laws, reduce and improve restrictions, because it does not lead to a positive result.
Economics means getting the right thing at a reasonable (but not always low) price to avoid enrichment and possibly criminal behavior.
But not the fact that we will achieve this by reducing the restriction of orders.
Perhaps this system will be overcrowded with "papers" so that those who wish to find loopholes in this system will find them much easier than if the restriction had not been lowered.
You are talking about the internal problems of practical application of the legislation on public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there such an organization as our KRU (Control and Audit Office) or does it work differently?
As far as the institutions are concerned, the Bundesrechnungshof, which is based on our principle, acts as our CRC, and there is also a college that operates a little differently, but basically both institutions function in the same way.
In addition, the powers are somewhat similar, but since Germany has a federal structure, then there are audit units and at the level of federal lands - in this their system is somewhat different from ours.
BRH can only manage federal money, we have government funds.
Public funds in our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of the Federal Accounts Chambers.
As for the local legislation, is it easier than we have?
In general, I would not like to compare without specific data, but in some respects Germany can be taken as a model, but it cannot definitely be said that it is better in everything.
Is it because they are better at controlling?
Definitely not, but I repeat, I do not like such comparisons.
But it must be said that even exemplary countries face many problems.
Otherwise, they wouldn't get any benefit from working with our office, would they?
If we talk about domestic legislation, how did the amendments to the Public Procurement Act affect your institution, in what way are the consequences?
Given that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet been reflected in our monitoring work.
Since we control the fact, it is necessary to take into account some delay.
We take this into account only in the process of preparing future inspections - we started using our new tool "detection of the risk of non-conservation", through which we drove almost 14000 government contracts. We analyzed them. There, of course, these changes will manifest themselves, because the restrictions are changing, the conditions of some types of tenders are changing and so on.
Do you think that the passage of this law will bring benefits or additional burdens on the bureaucracy system?
I think this law is definitely a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that may arise is that the rules will “harden” and it will not be possible to comply with them.
In the operation of the previous rules, controlled enterprises are connected with the supplier (for example, regional operational programs - with the regional council) in that any non-compliance with the law on public procurement means a violation of budgetary discipline.
Should the law be tightened in this way?
I don't think it's that way.
The system should exclude those who want to seize and abuse, but not punish those who make a formal mistake that does not affect the decision.
Such a system will only create even more pressure on the bureaucracy.
How to get out of this situation?
Let's face it, this path won't lead anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the GDP will not bother entrepreneurs with inspections of the so-called Schwartz system. What does this mean?
"Schwarz-system" prohibited or allowed?
The law should be established in some way, and if it prohibits something, then the Prime Minister cannot oppose the work of the bodies that are entrusted with the duty to verify and enforce the obligations.
You can say, "We'll change this law and we'll let it go," but you can't say we'll pretend like nothing's going on.
The law on public procurement contains quite strict rules as to how and what should be formally carried out, and this is correct. This will protect public procurement.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best offer is disqualified only because of formal flaws.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly, which, in my opinion, we lack.
The roads are slippery, but mostly pass by.
In some parts of the Czech Republic, roads are frozen and snowy.
Mostly they pass, but somewhere with more caution.
Karlovarsky Krai
This morning in the Karlovy Vary region roads were passed, but somewhere frozen and snowy.
The temperature dropped from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day it should warm up slightly.
Snowfall in the region has stopped, only in the lowlands there is a small layer.
However, on the ridges of the Red Mountains lies about 30 centimeters of snow.
From the information received from regional road workers, it became known that places had lower visibility due to fog.
The R6 motorway and first-class roads in the region are currently open without restrictions.
However, caution is needed, for example, on bridges where the surface can be frosty and slippery.
Also, all roads belonging to the second and third classes, including mountain tracks, are passable.
But in some of their areas there are still remnants of frozen and stagnant snow.
You need to be especially careful on roads located on high altitudes.
Pardubice and Kralovegradecki Krai
The administration of roads and highways of the Czech Republic on its pages on the Internet informs that some roads of the eastern Czech Republic are threatened by ice, and on mountain roads and roads located on the heights, there may be a layer of snow.
Regional road workers warn drivers about holodeck, which can be formed especially on the heights of the Pardubice region.
The Holodeck can be near Lanschcroun, Usti nad Orlici, Polichki, Svitavi or Vysoke Mito especially on the roads of the second and third classes.
Roads I/43 and I/34, located in Svitava, are treated with chemicals.
Especially snow lies on the roads of Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e and the Orlicki Mountains.
The rugged snow layer is located on roads located on highlands in the areas of Richnov nad Knezhnou and Trutnov.
In the east of the Czech Republic today there is a variable cloud without precipitation.
The temperature usually ranges from minus three to plus one degree Celsius, light wind.
Plzen Region
Roads in the Plzen region pass this morning, but in places you need to be careful and adapt to the weather.
In the morning it is cold, the temperature ranges from three to nine degrees below zero.
After snowfall and subsequent cooling in some places can be slippery.
In places, drivers may encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
The information was provided by regional road workers.
The D5 highway is now virtually unrestricted, however, road operators recommend caution between 80 and 131 kilometers.
Most first-class roads have a dry and frosty surface.
In the south of Plzny and Tahov can get frosty areas.
The roads of the second and third classes are wet, and also in this case there is a warning in connection with the possibility of the appearance of slippery areas.
Drivers should be careful, especially on underused roads in the Shumava area.
Olomouc Krai
Drivers heading to the heights of the Olomouc region should take into account the snow on the road today.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Red Mountain saddle and on the road in the direction of the Videl Cross.
At night, the snowfall forced road workers to take to the streets, according to information from the road management, about three centimeters of snow fell in Schumperk.
In other areas of the road edge, as a rule, pass without restrictions.
"On the heights of Schumperk lie the remains of snow.
Drivers heading towards Essenik should bear in mind the presence of snow porridge in the Red Mountain saddle,” – said today CHAN (Czech News Agency) dispatcher of the Schumperk road management.
At night, their colleagues from Essenek went to clean the roads, they assured that the roads on the heights after processing chemicals remained naked and wet.
In Olomouc, the roads pass without restrictions, but in Sternberg, drivers should be careful in forest areas where humidity is still present.
Ustetsky Krai, Liberec Krai
This morning, road workers from northern Bohemia report that there are a few hard-to-reach places left.
According to the information from the police database, in addition to several places with ice or snow, the mountain road on the site of Telnice on the Clinic in the Usteck region is closed.
Also, the temperature remains negative in the lowlands, so snow and ice remain on the roads. In the lowlands, especially to the south-east of the Czech Midlands, on the contrary, there are no problems, the roads are mostly dry.
Complications on the roads have not yet been reported.
Road workers report the appearance of holocaust in the vicinity of the damage.
According to meteorologists, perfect conditions were created for his education at night - all day it was raining and melting snow, at night the sky cleared and frosts began.
Unfavourable conditions are reported on the main highway and on the I/13 road on the border of the Ustets and Liberets regions.
Due to the snow-curved branches of the trees, the road itself, was forced to close the road in Telnice on Kninice.
Shimon Ornest: We want to accumulate positive energy at concerts
What do you think about the end of the world in less than a month?
This is just one of the many disturbing news that we humans find so easily.
Together with The Tap Tap, we are constantly joking about this topic and saying that we are the only band in the world that will be able to gather enough positive energy to delay or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December you are going to give absolutely unique three concerts towards the end of the world.
Can you tell the readers more about this?
This is a national fundraising event that we have been planning for two years now.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that the Mayan calendar has, the end of which was announced on December 21 at 11:10.
The day before this event, on December 20 at 21:00, three concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava will start in parallel.
They will end, roughly speaking, at the moment when the May calendar ends on the island of Kiribati in the Pacific, whose time zone is 12 hours earlier than ours.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we all came up with it together with our artist Gonza Augusta.
In addition to the fact that we want to accumulate enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think together with the public about the state in which this world we will one day pass on to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the May calendar, we have created a unique collection of items from shoes, T-shirts, bags and original keys towards the end of the world. These items can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz and thus support us.
The Tap Tap band, along with other musicians, also performed the anthem against the end of the world, which is called "The End of the World Cancelled".
Will the already-favoured YouTube audience hear the anthem at these benefit concerts?
Of course, at the very end, if in the end everything will work out and the end of the world will not come.
It is sung by all the performers at all concerts at the same time.
The anthems will also be broadcast live on Czech television.
Words to this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in the video Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Ganak, participates in the performance of also Xindl X...
How did you start working with them?
We also cooperate with other persons of Czech cultural life, as we hold many charity events and concerts.
We are actively trying to connect them to these projects.
It turned out that many people like to work with us, they are interested.
What will the proceeds from the concert towards the end of the world go to?
For the purchase of equipment for the barrier-free educational center STUDEO, for the sixth year we have been working with the Tap civil association at the Edlichki Institute.
Teachers regularly visit students of schools of the Institute of Edlichka and hold fun and interesting events with them.
The students themselves do not have the means to go to the teachers, and we try to provide them with this opportunity.
As part of the project of additional construction of the Institute of Edlichka, a separate building will be created in the future, into which we will move with this project.
At each concert there will be several musical groups and performers.
What were the selection criteria?
We have tried to create a program that will interest all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Marian Bango and Irji Suhi.
All details can be found at www.kpks.cz.
Are you planning any such “grand events” in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring Festival and here, of course, we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would love to have a performance at the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, would love to perform in Washington and Chicago.
You have serious plans about foreign countries, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the road in terms of organization and logistics?
It’s not as scary as it seems at first glance.
We have five participants on electric wheelchairs, their strollers should travel in the luggage compartment, plus a large amount of cargo and boxes with tools.
However, while they handled it without problems. Czech Airlines <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways have always been excellently prepared for us, which surprised me many times.
Even in Moscow, where we recently returned from, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to trips abroad, you can compare different countries in terms of accessibility, public relations to people with disabilities and so on.
What have you faced so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where everything works better than we have, in Russia we have witnessed that in the east is still at the basic level.
Compared to Prague in Moscow there are many barriers, and there is still a wildly independent movement of a person on an electric wheelchair in the center of the city.
Also, there are no such banal things as giving way to a disabled person in the elevator.
Fortunately, there are already social organizations that are trying to draw people’s attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And on the contrary, what do we have to constantly catch up with advanced countries?
There are a lot of things, the level of performance of which is far behind.
But it is important to clarify that improving and improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those to whom it concerns.
In London and Madrid, it is perfectly normal for people with severe disabilities to move around the streets on their own, to go to the toilet, to the museum, and anywhere else.
It is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities take an active part in public life, in this we are a little ahead of them with The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public or barrier-freeness is one thing, but the moment we see famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers, then everything will really start to change.
So far, these are isolated cases - people with strong will.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but let’s go back to two years ago, what made you organize it in 1998?
I went to the Edlichka Institute as an educator, there were a lot of young people around me who wanted to do something.
And since I am a musician and I play saxophone, I organized an interesting music circle together with my colleague.
Well, and over time, as our leading lady Angelovich says, it got a little out of control (laughs).
The popularity has only come in recent years, or am I confusing something?
It’s true, it helped us that we started to join the famous singers and actively work on the group’s propaganda.
We have come to the conclusion that work, which no one can appreciate, is essentially as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the funds of the European Union, we can afford qualified teachers, equipment and so on.
Was it your goal to promote The Tap Tap so well?
From the beginning, I felt their potential in the ability to do something extraordinary.
The show business is full of things that mimic each other.
This is logical, everything new is taken with caution, and it lasts a long time.
There are very few rare things, but I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us, of course, pity, is natural...
But this pity is completely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not some suffering and all abandoned personalities that we should be sorry for.
They are people who can live a full life and develop, of course, only if they have the necessary resources.
I say that if people with disabilities succeed, it is a shift not only for them, but for society as a whole.
Has success been ensured by being a strict leader, as many consider you?
If we want to do the job qualitatively, we have to be uncompromising in many things and keep a certain discipline.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and fly in the clouds, and when they find out that twice a week they have to go to rehearsals, attend preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the road, very quickly lose enthusiasm.
But this happens in any group that wants to work and achieve something.
There are currently 20 members of The Tap Tap.
How many were there at the beginning of 1998?
There's only one Lady Angelovich.
We are an open group, people come and go, it is impossible to prevent.
For those who have willpower and desire, our doors are always open.
It will take place a day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will be held in Prague at the Incheba stadium, in Brno - in the club Fléda and Ostrava - in the center of Plynojem with the participation of 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the concert, all three cities are connected by a telebridge at the time of the performance of the band's song The Tap Tap "The End of the World Cancelled".
The aim of this project is to raise funds in the amount of 25 million kronor for the purchase of multifunctional barrier-free equipment for the STUDEO educational center at the Edlicka Institute in Prague.
Tickets for the concert cost 400 kroner, admission is free for children up to 12 years. Tickets can be bought in advance at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and Space.
Last week, at a meeting of ministers of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as the second country from the former Eastern Bloc countries (after the Czech Republic, which became a full member of ESA on 12 September 2008).
Poland began working closely with ESA in 1994 and over the next few years took an active part in a number of Agency projects.
But the journey to space in Poland began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish enthusiasts were engaged in space flights, but this was not always met with understanding.
I would like to recall, for example, the lecture by A. Sternfeld, who presented ideas from his groundbreaking work “Introduction to Cosmonautics” at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory on December 6, 1933.
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) left the audience indifferent, after a few years Sternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomsky was interested in his work.
In 1934 in France, Sternfeld won the Robert Esno-Peltri and André Luis Hirsch Prize for "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomsky (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great propagandist of astronomy and cosmonauts.
He has published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and has written a number of books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky became a well-known world propagandist of spaceflight, and his contribution was appreciated, among other things, that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named in his honor.
Already in 1925 in Poland was built a railway girder equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea remained unknown, as well as the details of the project.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should have been used to accelerate or brake the cart.
Information about this costume is known only from the press of that era.
Since 1933, the Polish artillery began to think about missile arrows.
The study was carried out by the Section of Weapons Technology in cooperation with Professors Mechislav Wolfka and Gustav Mokzhitsky.
From the preserved materials, it can be seen that the studies have reached the stage of practical tests.
But with the arrival of German troops, work was interrupted.
In 1937 in the specialized press appeared the idea of a photoelectric fighter rocket, which was proposed by the engineer Rogozinsky, and the following year came out the work "Air missile-torpedo and aviation missile-bomb" by the author Lelivy-Kzhivoblotsky.
Both projects were designed for military use of rocket engines.
Before the war itself, all projects for the military use of missile technology were carried out by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all work.
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, the work was finished because of the beginning of the war.
The next scientific work on cosmonauts appeared in the Polish press after the war, thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronauts (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time about the society is mentioned in the November 1954 issue of the magazine "Problems", in which four voluminous articles on astronautics are published.
In one of them, Professor M. Subotovich proposed to organize a society that would be engaged in astronautics.
At that time, artificial satellite projects were already gaining momentum, and it was clear that space exploration was a promising industry.
Since the beginning of 1956, the Polish Society of Astronautics (POA) has been trying to join the International Federation of Astronautics (founded in 1951), and in the autumn of the POA became its full member.
The following year, Kazimierz Zarankevich, the first chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics (1902-1959), became vice-chairman of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He remained in this position until his death, which occurred in 1959.
Since 1956, the POA has made a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological missile RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile to carry out scientific research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first launch took place on October 10, 1958.
The missile, able to overcome a distance of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long, and its weight was less than 5 kg.
Subsequently, an improved version of the RM-1A was built, and in the summer of 1959, two-stage tests of the RM-2 rocket were carried out on the Bled desert.
This rocket was about 1.4 m long, and its weight was about 11.5 kg.
The next version of the rocket was already able to do real scientific work - the rocket RM-34 could overcome 14.5 km, and its task was to monitor the high-altitude wind.
In 1962, however, further development was halted.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage, its total length was 510 cm, and the initial weight - 32.5 kg.
Three types (designated Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed in the size of the camera for scientific equipment.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a volume of 0.4 liters, Meteor-1B - 0.34 liters, and Meteor-1C - 0.62 liters.
The maximum flight range for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Institute of Aviation was developing a Meteor-2 rocket, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket with a launch weight of 380 kg was able to lift a payload weighing 10 kg to a height of about 60 km.
Then were built versions of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3.
It is also worth mentioning the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Committee on Space Research) in 1960 and the establishment of the COSPAR National Committee two years later.
In addition, as part of the Intercosmos program, Poland participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites, and in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslav Hermashevsky became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution to the problem.
Last week, the Constitutional Court overturned the Public Works Act.
The decision sparked a lively debate in the community.
It will certainly be interesting to look at this issue from a broader perspective.
Liberally-oriented economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of multiple, unregulated economic competition.
In essence, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems, are in constant conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital together with unbridled financial speculation.
As a result of a significant difference in the cost of labor (wage) there is a price tension.
By this concept it is necessary to understand the state when the manufacturer by means of the delivery of cheap goods tries to withstand economic competition by "converting" the value of the competitor in order to take up most of the market and thus increase its own income.
On a mass scale, this means for most entrepreneurs either the transfer of production abroad, or cheap purchases abroad, or disappearance. As a result, unemployment increases in those countries where the cost of labor, compared to others, is high.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility, including for the unemployment it produces, the inevitable costs of the state for social needs increase.
In general, the situation reinforces the reluctance of the employers to pay taxes and thereby compensate for the social economic and social damage they cause in the pursuit of profit.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to give specific statistics.
Unceremonious methods of private capital create at the level of the economies of individual states a situation where the governments of countries are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially reduce the social level of their population in order to attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments give their own population at random to private capital, despite the social decline.
This is reflected primarily in the changes in the current legislation.
The aim is to make its people economically obedient to the dictates of private capital, especially in the field of wages.
It acts as a system of economic coercion in the event of long-term unemployment and at the same time serves as a tool to curtail the rights of workers in the field of labour law.
As a result, the level of poverty increases, and at the same time, the difference between the poor and the rich.
In Germany, for several years, there has been a public distribution of food to the poor, who are unable to feed themselves with their own labor.
The number of these people is already approaching a million.
Within the framework of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are constantly cases when employed people receive such a salary that the state must pay them in order for them to receive the subsistence minimum.
Such a scandal became known to the public and in the case of additional employees of the Bundestag.
Economic measures in almost all the southern states of the EU undoubtedly lead to the same state in which people under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in social status are forced to either emigrate, as it was in the 19th century, or to exist on a poverty-stricken salary on the backs of society in the hope that they will be invested in the future.
But the question is, where will he come from?
If capital comes from other EU countries, then poverty will move from one country to another, or it will not come at all, because the Chinese, Hindus, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians, Africans are still working for a share of European wages.
This applies to the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theory and the mass media go so far as to claim that the state cannot participate in the capital of its own economy, that a managed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital insists that the state should not interfere with the economy by controlling actions.
The question must then be answered as to whether private capital, which is now practically in charge of politics and therefore of the whole state, operates for its own selfish purposes.
The unequivocal answer is yes.
The evidence is the existence of almost omnipotent and ubiquitous lobbies in all states.
As a result, we have a hopeless situation, manifested in corruption, the provision of mutual benefits, in legislation, where almost everything deserves punishment, but is not a crime.
In Germany, the situation is such that state ministries, due to the lack of funds, entrust the development of draft laws to private law firms that are closely related to industry.
Then these bills are approved by the Bundestag.
All power does not come from the people, as the constitution of the Western type says, but from financial and powerful groups that prefer their own interests.
It is obvious that liberal-oriented democracy is now rapidly finding itself in a situation as described by Appian in the work “Crisis of the Roman Empire in the days of Caesar and Pompeii”: “The state has long since disintegrated, and the agencies are engaged in violence.
Abductions, unlawful receiving of graces with the help of stones and swords.
The peasantry and corruption prospered without any prohibitions, and the people went to the elections with the vote sold in advance"... the decent people did not run for the position of ruler at all, in the end one day the state was left without a consul for eight months....
As in ancient times, in modern society predominate own reckless interests without taking into account public interests.
Private capital is no longer, in essence, intended for public use.
The present result is no different from the past: the unprecedented decline of the elite without any effort to carry out reforms of a deeper nature.
The reason for the rise of fascist and communist regimes is that we must look for the reckless liberalization of the economic systems of the 19th and 20th centuries.
To date, the absence of these regimes and the existence of a liberal-type democracy can be perceived as a certain pause, after which the next round is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elite completely ignores the consequences of the hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are already witnessing, along with crimes against humanity, as we know from old and new history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a decision, or at least not forever.
Under the pressure of competition at both international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will have to continue to look for ways to further reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic in nature.
The solution is targeted political and social reforms that will strengthen the shareholding of the state in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the governance of the state and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: The Laboratory of Chaos.
“Nothing will come out of violence, and it can never come out” – Sting, the song “Weak”, where the main verse of the refrain are the words: “let’s not forget how fragile we are”.
"If my sons didn't want war, they wouldn't have it." - Gutel Schnaper, wife of Meer Amschel Rothschild.
The latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, has elicited many responses.
Some argue for Israel, arguing that it has the right to self-defence, while the Palestinians act as terrorists, others support the Palestinians, arguing this with the racism of the Israeli state, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is accused of terrorism.
I do not want to think about who is a criminal in these periodically recurring waves of killings, and who is a victim, after all, today’s citizens of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born at the time of the current political situation, and were not witnesses of the beginning of the violence.
My goal is to offer readers a behind-the-scenes look at who first serves the 95-year-long tension (counting from the signing of the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small piece of Middle Eastern land.
Some of my reasoning is supported by historical facts, some of which are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people is the main driver of events in modern history.
The history of mankind is first and foremost the history of the struggle for power.
In each era we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
That is not so clear - whether these people always took their own steps completely independently, or behind their throne was someone who directed their actions to the previously planned goals.
It must be admitted that we are living in a period when world wealth is concentrated in the hands of several individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that flows from it could not have occurred in the lifetime of one generation.
Among the astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered as the head of the spruce (I don’t know if anyone stands above them, but this is not excluded) – the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
They bought the first news agency (Reuters) back in the 90s of the 19th century to stop rumors linking their name to crimes in the higher realms in which they were in the shadows, which always led to the strengthening of their power, the accumulation of wealth, or both.
They have large stock packages in almost all the central banks of the world, and against countries in whose central banks they do not have their share, they are conducting or preparing a war (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were only 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Gaddafi there were only four countries, but at the same time, the government of the country remained focused on its own.
Anyone who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to retain the status of a central bank under the Rothschild Bank of America, during the Civil War he began to issue his own (understand - government) money and was killed in 1865 in the theater.
John F. Kennedy began to issue his own money and wanted to abolish the Fed (Federal Reserve System), was killed in 1963. MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for unleashing the Great Economic Crisis in 1929.
Their thirst for world power between 1859 and 1871 led to the development of a plan of three world wars, created by the great mason of the 33rd level Albert Pike.
The task of the first war was the destruction of the monarchical states in Europe, the second was to destroy the colonial dominion, especially the United Kingdom, and the third was to reduce the world's population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number of slaves would be enough to ensure their comfort and luxury, and they would not consume many resources).
The method by which a group of the richest families, led by the Rothschilds, works is the challenge of the crisis and the subsequent proposal of solutions (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
But these decisions are false and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the FED’s foundation, which was supposed to prevent the recurrence of the crisis caused by them in 1907).
Thus, after they succeeded in unleashing World War I by killing the Habsburg heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed tsarist Russia by initiating the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly, unwarranted in military and economic terms with the capitulation of Germany (there was no longer a need for war to destroy tsarist Russia) and, as a result, there was a fragmentation of the Central European power, Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of World War II, the bankers and politicians created a hidden conflict situation, imposed a huge military reparations on Germany, than to create a precondition for the radicalization of the impoverished masses, then it remained only to throw the Germans strong enough, blaming the guilty and offering simple solutions to the leader.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds provoked the foundation of the Zionist movement, one branch of which sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the area of historic Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration created a prerequisite for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and the first clashes with the local Arab population began.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke out of the chains in which he was originally held by the bankers, or everything he did was planned, in any case, the suffering of European Jews in concentration camps created the prerequisites for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, just as Germany was provoked by military reparations for World War II, the State of Israel was proclaimed to create the focal point of the Third War.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing it, the Jewish people, as in World War II, will become a victim of fighting on the front line, now together with the Arab or, to put it simply, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a giant laboratory, a source of discord and chaos not only within the country, but also at the international level (to take only the sharp division of people into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame, and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, where insult breeds resentment in an endless chain of violence, if it all began with the greed of individuals and their desire for world power?
Here it is necessary to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, like us, international bankers bribe people to vote in elections exclusively for their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel hawk Netanyahu is a typical example of a fascist, loyal to the international bankers and a politician who does everything to start a war with Iran, which, thanks to Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan ...), will threaten to overgrow.
In what light are the words of David Rockefeller in 1994: “All we need is a common crisis, and people will adopt a new world order.”
The new world order in their representation is the world of lords and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves as a handful of financial aristocracy enjoying comfort.
A world where every born organism at birth is implanted with a chip, with which it becomes a being under total control.
“And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to have on their right hand or on their forehead a seal, that the man who is not marked with the name of that beast, or the number of his name, may neither buy nor sell.
Here is wisdom: anyone with a mind can calculate the number of the beast.
For it is in the name of man, and the number is six hundred and sixty-six.
The movie "Operation Argo": When there is nowhere worse, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamist student demonstrators seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They were to be released in exchange for the overthrown Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution in the United States, who had been the patron of his regime for decades.
The U.S. administration did not expect a positive outcome - it could not afford to throw the chess overboard, because it could fundamentally undermine the trust of allies in other countries.
However, to achieve the liberation of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which was later reinforced by a failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The detained diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after talks brokered by the Algerian government.
Their fate caused a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The defeat in Iran greatly contributed to Jimmy Carter's defeat in the 1980 presidential election, which ended with the election of Ronald Reagan.
The film, directed by actor Ben Affleck, "Operation Argo" describes one of the episodes of the story that brought America small victories.
Shortly before the occupation of the embassy, six workers managed to escape.
After some difficult journeys, they ended up at the Canadian Embassy.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, aided by the extravagant legend of cover-up, according to which they went out on Canadian passports as members of the filming group, looking for a place in the country for filming a science fiction epic.
Combination of genres
The plan, invented by “evacuation” expert Tony Mendes, required Hollywood’s cooperation.
In order for the legend to be true, specialized magazines wrote about the project of the film, press conferences were held, the fictional production company had a real office.
Details of the operation have long been kept secret, a film based on the memoirs of Tony Mendes.
The film Affleck is a special combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a real political thriller, the so-called "movie-movie-opus", the story of a successful affair, an affair - an example may be a number of films about friends of Ocean.
The moods in the film are constantly changing - on the one hand, documentary scenes from Tehran (the titles show iconic historical photographs of events and how the same situations were demonstrated in the film - there are no big differences in this).
On the other hand, the lighter Hollywood passages intersect with irony and a moderate exaggeration.
And then scenes from the headquarters of the CIA and other institutions - men in suits discuss the situation at the negotiating tables, on the stairs of institutions, by phone ...
Ben Affleck did a great job of restarting his career.
From the ridiculed actor became a respected director, and his game ceased to be an object of ridicule.
"Operation Argo" is his third full-length film, after the dark detective "Goodbye, Baby, Goodbye" (2007) and the thriller "City" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck’s first film, which is not filmed in the director’s hometown of Boston.
The feeling of the atmosphere of the place at the same time refers to the qualities that elevated the director's earlier films above the Hollywood standard.
And Affleck demonstrates this in Argo, where Tehran is “playing” Canada.
The best scenes in the film take place on the streets, while reconstructing real events - the opening scenes of the fall of the embassy impress with their clarity, which also conveys the emotions of confusion and unpredictability that arise when somewhere suddenly history changes.
A similar effect is achieved by Affleck and his colleagues in the scenes of the fictional (fake headquarters on the Tehran bazaar).
Too many processes in too many places.
The director had to deal with the fact that the story does not involve many exciting scenes of cinematic significance.
He works quite successfully with this few, sometimes he thinks something up - there it all comes out not so elegantly (the scene in which a phone call in America prevents the impending crisis at Tehran airport, and the chase on the runway looks rather over-the-top).
The disadvantage of "Argo" is the distraction associated with the need to show too many events in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman in the role of Hollywood colleagues are really very charming, but their characters would deserve more space, and they are not the only ones in the film.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of drama, it is a film that can be watched with moderate interest, appreciating the staging and retro style that recreates the thrillers of the seventies.
But it's hard to capture.
However, this is enough to remind one, still in a certain sense of living history, as well as to testify to how exaggerated are the notions of omnipotent and omniscient intelligence services.
Rules of inflating balloons, bananas and circus
The portal www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually conducts a survey on the most absurd bank charges, has now decided to announce a competition for “the most absurd resolution or project from an EU workshop”.
“We were moved to this last event in which the EU plans to accept a 40 percent quota for women in the administration of large European companies,” said Patrick Nager, organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities already put forward for nomination is the recent decision of the European Court of Justice to combine the rate of insurance contributions for men and women.
So far, women have had life insurance benefits because they are objectively less at risk for insurance companies.
“Further incredible ideas from the EU workshop people can put forward for the competition before the end of this year.
The vote itself will take place by the end of February 2013,” Nager said.
The EU's controversial regulations include, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel, which results in harm to nature, as well as a ban on the use of reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of dangerous substances, or a directive on the size of the cage for chickens, which is why it is essential this year.
Also criticized was the actual ban on the use of the term "butterfly oil" or the withdrawal from the sale of classic bulbs.
High-quality bananas should be 14 centimeters long.
The pan-European apparatus often makes a decision under the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, whose positions in Brussels are usually defended by a state or group of states (so the Czech Republic now even under the threat of veto defends the demands of its banks).
The interests of the lobby are: for example, high-quality bananas in the European Union had to reach a length of 14 cm and did not dare to show an "abnormal curvature".
At the same time, the European Commission has justified itself by only harmonizing the existing fragmented national rules that have complicated trade.
The EU, despite the resistance of some states, has still softened the standards for fruits and vegetables, citing that existing directives will lead to food waste.
A candidate for the poll may also be last year's EU resolution, according to which air balloons sold must necessarily be provided with a warning that children under the age of eight can not inflate them without the supervision of adults.
The EU has called for U.S. studies showing that in-game balloons are a potential cause of death for children through strangulation.
Such a restriction now applies to children under the age of 14 who are prohibited from blowing into fair pits.
Funny ideas are born at home
The rule concerning European officials themselves is quite absurd: anyone who holds any official position in the EU cannot, given the sensitivity of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia, and should instead say "BURM" (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The portal Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com, in cooperation with the association of liberal economists "The principle of non-intervention" (Laissez Faire), proposed to vote, in addition to several of the above absurd rules, for example, the EU rule on the volume of food reserves in the territory of a member state.
The EU has set a maximum amount of food stocks that may be in the Czech Republic on the day of its accession to the European Union.
Subsequently, the Czech Republic exceeded, for example, the established volumes of preserved mushrooms, for which it was threatened with a large fine.
Organizers of the questionnaire were also interested in the idea of paying some countries for not having a sea, and the idea of granting subsidies for a grant application.
But these ideas arose in Prague, not in Brussels.
“We are in a bad situation because we don’t have a sea.
We will ask the European Union for compensation," the then Minister of Agriculture, Yaroslav Palas, said in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the country had a high crop of grain, and as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full stockpiles of stocks that had to be exported.
For the fact that the Czech Republic is far from the ports, the EU, according to the Palace, had to pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
As a result, the European Commission went to the Czech Republic, organizing a tender for the purchase of grain from countries that have no access to the sea.
Subsidies for the subsidy were offered to the villages by the Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Paul Nemts (US-DEU), in particular, such subsidies had to go to the application for subsidies from Brussels.
EU: Odd orders are an exception
Although decisions in the Member States are easily criticised, the EU’s efforts to regulate, as well as to make the European Union function and develop more effectively, are, according to many experts, more deserving of recognition.
A serious problem, according to experts, is the extraction of EU subsidies for projects that do not even have an indication of something in common with the deepening of European integration, but which Member States achieved when discussing the budget.
The Czech Republic, like other countries in the European Union, should fight in Brussels for the right to a specific identification of its traditional products, and it does not always win in this competition.
Although the Czechs, after six years of fighting with the Germans and Austrians, have retained the name "Olomoutsky cheeses", but "Tuzemsky rum", the traditions of which in our country go back to the 19th century, our producers had to change their name to "Tuzemak".
Rum can only be called products from cane distillate, and not from sugar beet.
In the official list of registered products of the EU, along with the world-famous "feta" and "gorgonzola" cheeses, marzipan from German L<0xC3><0xBC>beck or Parma ham, have already been found, for example, Karlovarské d<0xC5><0xAF>hari, Po<0xC5><0xBE>or<0xC5><0xBE>elice and Trebo<0xC5><0x88> carp and <0xC5><0xBE>ateczek hme.
The EU trade mark can also be proud of Pardubice gingerbread and Gorzhitsa pipes.
“People want me to protect the republic, but I’m an amateur,” Okamura said.
Mr. Senator, how does it come to a person's mind to run for president?
I don’t think about becoming a senator or president myself.
If we had everything in the country without problems, then I would not have run anywhere.
But I can no longer watch the country get robbed over the last 20 years, how thieves get lost here, people raise taxes and the retirement age.
I had no ambition to be a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, I try to find a way to change it.
And since I am already forty years old and I am an independent person who does not belong to any party, I have no other opportunity to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You went to the Senate, but you soon went to the presidential palace.
Do you not turn your back on the people who have chosen you?
I've always said that I'd join the fight for the presidential castle depending on the outcome of the Senate election.
I later clarified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
My goal is not a post, a post is a tool with which I can implement my views.
Therefore, I need the greatest influence and the broadest authority.
But the difficulty is not only that we as a nation are yelling at ourselves in a bar or on TV, but that we are ready to crush anyone who tries to change anything.
To this is added the media, which denigrates the person, and which confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lies.
For example, I was told that I give bribes to journalists, or that I was an adviser to Irgi Paroubek.
Let's move on to your views.
The struggle for the presidential castle began with theses about the material and criminal liability of politicians and about the return of property declarations in the amount of more than twenty million.
To do this, the law needs to be changed.
You have no such powers as president, and only an entire Senate can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, lobbied for tours to become a free enterprise, this was promoted.
The problem is politics – when someone comes up with a good proposal on the left or the right, they are deliberately obstructed, and this deters citizens.
As an independent non-party person, I have much more potential to gain support from all parliamentary parties.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country, and apply it, without the party’s division on the shelves, without regard to dogmas.
Do you consider yourself to be more of a right-winger or a left-winger?
From the Czech point of view, it seems to me that people treat me rather to the left.
It doesn’t matter to me at all – a little to the left or a little to the right.
It is important to me that we move forward.
It’s not about someone being on the right, it’s about someone on the left, I want to bring people together.
I will always support any good decision for society, whether it is proposed by the CCPM or the GDP, and I will also be against a bad idea.
You get angry when someone says you're a populist.
But don't you prove it by what you said?
When you create a business plan for a firm, you also have some ideal goals and views.
And that’s what you’re trying to get close to.
You can call it populism, but all the proposals I’m talking about are already working in the world, or they’re being talked about by prominent experts.
But without the support of parliament, you will only have slogans.
You won’t be able to do that in politics for long.
Or do you think that when you go out to people and talk to them, you will be able to realize criminal and material responsibility?
I have no other choice.
Only to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to persuade them on our side so that we can achieve ours.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to organize a live television broadcast in which I would appeal to the chairmen of parliamentary parties to legalize material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And if they refuse, they will have to tell you why they don’t want it.
If there is a strong person who will voice abuse, then it will be possible to put pressure on the political scene.
Take the direct election of the president - it was a merit of pressure from the public.
I say directly that I am an amateur, not a genius and not an intellectual.
I try to find allies to defend my beliefs and views.
I am just a beginner in politics, and for my program I will try to get the support of the majority.
I'm trying to push things on my own; if I don't, I'll be done in six years and I'll be back in the private sector.
It sounds, in part, like Okamura has to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a rescuer.
I know I’m not going to do anything alone, so I bypassed a number of famous people with an offer to run for the Senate.
I went to Radim Yanchura, he refused due to the large amount of work.
I also at least supported leading investigative journalist Jan Lorentzov, who uncovered a scam involving light fuel oil products.
I put forward my candidacy because people are really unhappy, but now I feel like I’m on a roll.
Sixty percent of the people did not go to the elections, and the majority of those who went elected representatives of the establishment.
There are only two independents in the Senate.
The people elected the Senate so that the changes would be difficult to implement.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for direct elections of mayors and governors.
Do you think about the foundation of your own party?
I haven’t thought about it yet because I don’t have time to check the purity of every potential supporter’s past, and I don’t have the money for that.
There is no money for the presidential campaign, on my transparent account only twenty thousand kroner.
You don't have any money?
You are talking about property declarations, and how are your own affairs with this?
Personal property is estimated at approximately $60 million.
I have a plot in Prague worth about 25 million, an apartment of 10 million, another apartment of 8 million, a collection of works of art of about 10 million, Aston Martin of 3.5 million and Skoda Superb of a million, well and a few million more on account.
By the way, Aston Martin came to me because it was my boy's dream - I always liked James Bond, who was driving a car, was gallant with women and at the same time fought against meanness and lawlessness.
You drive to Aston Martin, you own $60 million worth of property, and you don't have the money to campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don’t want to invest your own money in it.
That's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to go into debt?
I've already invested $2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have sponsors shows that my program isn’t that interesting.
And I don't have to pay for the election campaign out of my pocket.
The cost of the campaign is basically going to cover the senator's salary.
But for this money I would not live, for example, I would not be able to pay my son for an English school, which costs 30 thousand a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't be running for office.
So, will you continue to do business so that you can live?
Didn't you say you'd cut this activity?
But it doesn’t depend on the size of the salary.
As I promised, I have partially reduced my activity.
For example, the managing director of the travel agency in the spring will be my deputy.
People would like me to be the silversmith who will keep the republic.
But I also have to live for something.
How much, as an entrepreneur, do you get used to receiving monthly?
Two hundred to four hundred thousand, which I still get.
If I were president, I would have finished my business.
You will find the full interview in the Saturday edition of the newspaper "Prawo".
MVRDV architects prove that true adventures are not only in the imagination - on the example of Speakenisse and his newly built Book Mountain - 2 photos
“This building seems fun to me, it looks futuristic, finally we can see something interesting again,” says Lizette Verhaig, walking on the edge of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT specialist at a nearby large enterprise, thinks like this: “No, this building is really beautiful.”
But I ask myself: why do we have another library today?
Everyone has the Internet, iPad, and e-books.
Now no one voluntarily goes to such old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spekkenisse, an unremarkable sleepy town near Rotterdam, holds an unusual record.
Its population of 80,000 people has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
To combat this annoying circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to build seven imaginary bridges, which are depicted on euro banknotes, in the form of painted miniatures made of reinforced concrete.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the city fathers realized that they had the only chance to beat the statistics: to build a library here!
Vinnie Maas of the Rotterdam architectural bureau MVRDV, a master of bold bar charts and the author of witty, sometimes even cynical constructions, took on the task with his usual impatience and appeared at a competition audition in 2003 with five books under his arm and a nod to his face.
And while the members of the jury looked puzzled and shrugged, the daring Maas composed from his original gift a pyramid in size and concluded the speech in defense of his project with the following words: "Dear citizens!"
Here it is, my proposal: "Book Mountain" in Spekeniss, the so-called Buchenberg!
Nine years later, this mountain, worth 30 million euros, has grown.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes an underground garage, supermarket, post office and several adjacent residential houses and townhouses totaling 50 apartments.
In early November, the Book Mountain was awarded the second prize of the competition "Best Library of the Netherlands 2012".
The project also participates in the national Dutch wooden building competition of 2012.
Thus, the impersonal suburb, which previously could not offer anything except a postmodernist pedestrian zone and the surprisingly ugly town hall, whose white facades suggest a dairy, became richer for one modern work of architecture.
But most importantly, the first public building of cultural purpose in the history of this town appeared in Speakenisse.
The Long Road to the Book
First impression: the book Eldorado under the cap for cheese.
There is only one elevator passing in the center of the mountain range, because real fans of architecture and reading will prefer to explore this area on foot.
Glassed on all sides, the room is bright and easily seen, floors made of burnt brick and elegant street lights create a sense of public urban space.
The urban environment is perfectly recreated.
Look involuntarily looking for benches, dogs and playing football boys and girls.
And everywhere - books, books, books.
“Usually the bookshelves stand along the facades, and in the middle there is a large dark hall, usually uncomfortable and faceless,” says Vinny Maas.
We put the classic configuration of the space from the foot to the head and pulled out the reading area from the inside out.
The inner space of the mountain is skillfully used: in the center there are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental center and technical premises.
Especially pleased are the black bookshelves, which serve as wall decoration, parapets, and stair railings.
Their appearance, texture and smell are unusual.
Even experienced architects and engineers-builders get lost in guessing what this unknown material is.
“We wanted to work with secondary materials,” explains Yop Trauborst, project manager representing the Speakenisse community, according to the standard’s requirements.
And once at an agricultural enterprise in Frisia, we found a suitable by-product of agriculture.
For many years in greenhouses and fields in the Netherlands, artificial fibrous material of millimeter thickness has been used as a substrate for roots.
It is cheap and saves time.
Thin textiles serve one or two seasons, after which it can be thrown away.
For the library, this canvas - for the first time in such volumes - was pressed into a four-centimeter-thick panel.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbauplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, uniform, durable material, a little like a new car and a little sneakers.
There are 105 steps to the top.
Anyone who overcomes the path of almost 500 meters in length will be rewarded in a literary cafe not only with fantastic views of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and wooden ficus in pots.
They care about the atmosphere, and first of all about the correct humidity of the air on the literary mountain.
The Cost of a New Soul
“It’s hard to believe, but this building, despite its many glass surfaces, is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The heat of the earth is used for its heating and cooling.
Although the Book Mountain is under a glass cap, even on clear days the sun gets inside only for a short time.
Large farms made of glued wood, located perpendicularly to the glass facade, give shade and take on most of the sun's rays.
The climate in the room is very pleasant.
The rest of the protection is provided by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the IT skeptic mentioned above, has already visited the new library.
Lizette Verhayg was already here.
Also, traditional Chinese medicine teacher Cynthia Bogard, who called Buchenberg "the soul of Speakenisse, which has long been lacking."
The reason: a few weeks before the opening, each resident received an invitation to donate one book from his own collection.
These books were to take up empty seats on the shelves of a library not yet fully stocked - at that time there were 70,000 books in it.
The idea worked.
The shelves are up.
“There’s nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Vinnie Maas.
“I think that thanks to our invitation now every resident is somehow connected to this new home.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration.
Thus, MVRDV managed to solve the royal task, which in professional jargon is called identity creation.
Spokenesse wrote his own literary history.
Let them be very young and uneducated.
This is just the starting point for identity building.
Sabo: "The Germans must play a more important role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the recognition of Palestine.
According to Stefan Sabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic path.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first made it clear that it would vote against the Palestinian request for observer status at the United Nations.
Berlin abstained from the vote.
Why? Why?
Stefan Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli actions in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be cautious about its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I believe that she does not support the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence, without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the introduction of a no-fly zone.
In the end, NATO implemented this proposal.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
The fact is that it is in the process of transforming its foreign policy, namely, from the policy, which, so to speak, was run by the United States, to the German foreign policy itself.
The situation is further complicated by the fact that Europeans do not have a coherent unified policy.
Thus, the Germans again find themselves between the two fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe that so far they are only sensing their role, but are on the way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
Such a foreign policy as is carried out by France or the United Kingdom.
What exactly does “normal” foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a willingness to take a position in their national interest that does not depend on the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy depends on economic policy, that is, on exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are very different from those of other major states, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
First, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it needs to be careful not to offend the public and the elites in Arab countries.
In any case, it plays a role.
But I wouldn’t attach too much importance to that, it’s not a completely one-sided connection.
But in any case, it plays an important role in the calculations of the Germans.
Has Germany harmed its relations with the United States by refraining from making important decisions, such as voting on Palestine?
I am sure that understanding of the German position prevails in Europe and even in the United States.
So I don’t think it was as dramatic a snag as the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect in this way.
After all, this signals that she should be taken seriously as a player in the international arena and that her interests should be taken into account.
There are differing views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The U.S., on the contrary, has clearly expressed its support for the veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the United States and many European countries?
Because of American domestic politics, such differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has a deep understanding of the European position.
But due to the local political situation, the government, of course, cannot openly take such a position.
I believe that the significant differences in opinion are not as significant as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about Netanyahu’s policies.
Is it easy for Germany to combine its close ties with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the most important partner in the EU on the other?
I think that is what makes the situation so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a single, uncontested European policy, but now it is not.
Therefore, they cannot take a broader approach and are forced to act instead, relying only on their own vision of the situation.
This is what they do with the euro.
I think that in the future Germany will take a leading role in developing a common European position.
It is clear that this is not easy for Germany, at least because of its ties with Israel.
This topic has always been tricky.
But I think it is clear to the Germans that they should play a more independent role.
If Germany sees itself as an important international player, will it not really take the lead?
Or is the leading role still hard to give to Germany?
Germany is not yet used to this, it is still always unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is always difficult to play a significant role.
Consider, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes on an important role, there are various anti-German feelings.
The Germans don't just deal with it.
Actually, it’s an old problem: you don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It should take into account the most different neighbors and opinions, and this is not easy.
So, the influence of the US in European politics is constantly weakening, but at the moment the EU does not fill this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
Even if you do not like it, unpleasant or strengthens the dislike for you - such a life!

Trademark protection in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is also.
What is Armani Polo?
This is a completely officially registered name in China, which has nothing to do with the firms from which it is formed.
However, it will be protected until the owners of the original names file a claim.
It is unclear if they will be able to defend their rights.
“Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing, which specializes in trademark infringements in the Far East.
There's a new case like this on my desk every week.
It is enough for imitators to add just a few letters to get the right to register their trademarks.
So from Gucci comes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you can register Prada-Kny.
In the same way, German companies, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma, are legally copied.
Pattloch opens a folder with the records of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, the Chinese company registered there the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that also used the name of the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In large cities there are multi-storey department stores selling almost exclusively fakes.
On behalf of his trustees, he opposes the Chinese companies being formally granted the trademark registration authority the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Ban Minpai", a passenger brand.
This word is associated with "ban dakuan".
That's what they call women who hunt for rich men.
The Chinese government does not admit guilt.
“It’s damaging to the business, it needs to be fought,” Pattloch said.
“The brand is being washed away, the unique position is being lost, the image is suffering very much.”
Financial losses and procedural costs in the affected industries are estimated in the millions, especially in the case of expensive copied products.
According to market research firm CLSA, China, with sales of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion a year, is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods.
However, it is difficult to achieve the removal of questionable entries in the trademark registry, and it is expensive.
The process can take up to nine years, with an unclear outcome.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court rejected the lawsuits, as after a long time the contested name became "the reality of the market".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay the plagiarist, as he has damaged his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
There are also famous cases about graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a lawsuit with construction machine manufacturer Sany, a company that had just acquired the concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
Therefore, the Chinese still have the right to use the emblem, similar to the Mercedes star.
The Volvo-bought Geely company originally used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The manufacturer of fashion goods Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, in which the famous crocodile looked the other way.
The Chinese authorities do not consider themselves to be guilty.
The CTMO trademark registration office in Beijing confirms that in 2010 there were difficulties due to the lack of staff and equipment of the premises there.
But last year there was a “return from an emergency in the working process to normal”.
Thus, the number of pending objection cases decreased by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases were closed, 75 percent more than last year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending in the department.
Fighting it is expensive.
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has topped the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the ministry said.
The same applies to the total number of actual trademarks, only 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan of fees were paid.
If simplified, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
To protest it is worth many times more, as the case of the German family enterprise Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the concern has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans managed to ensure that their illegal production of fake car parts was eliminated.
However, the impersonator secured Chinese rights to the Freudenberg trademark.
This was a personal oversight, as surnames in Germany are not subject to protection, says Hanno Ventzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
And the CTMO trademark registration agency rejected the claim of the Munichers.
True, in both of the following instances Freudenberg won, but the opposing side continues the fight to this day.
You need to be on the lookout
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Ventzler hopes to bring the case to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, “The process is extremely expensive and takes a lot of time, money and nerves.”
Internal costs can hardly be taken into account, the archive of the firm had to view even the acts of a century ago to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a “large six-figure sum in euros” for the settlement.
“It’s clear from here how expensive it is for us,” says Ventzler.
The dangers of the Far East threaten to spill over even into Europe.
That is, if the imitators register unprotected trademarks there.
So, one Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the Freudenberg name for shoes and leather goods.
The concern has long ceased production in these areas, but despite this was able to prevent registration.
“You have to be on the lookout,” says Ventzler.
Both he and Pattloch’s lawyer recommend that German companies be very careful with China.
It is not enough to rely on international regulations on the protection of trademarks, rather foreigners should "all that is somehow worth protecting, register also in China", - says Ventzler.
Otherwise, it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed, if Freudenberg loses in the final act of his trademark drama, he will have to pay the opposing party license fees for his own name, Ventzler explains.
Otherwise, we will be pushed out of the market in the controversial segment.
World AIDS Day: Flooding, Singing, Helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing – and in Swaziland, the AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The history of relationships that have crossed a distance of more than 8733 kilometers.
First, the watering is distributed: cowboy boots, basketball sneakers, women's boats and men's shoes pick up the beat on the parquet floor and quickly find it.
One-two-three-four.
It is only after this that the voices of the singers – alto, bass, tenor and soprano – slowly increase – they come, enchant and follow each other.
And Fite Hopf, a 29-year-old conductor, almost jumps out of his motherly shoes when he leads them with flexible and expressive gestures.
On Monday evening, in the music hall of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi choir is rehearsing a new song.
Fifty choir members from 23 to 69 years old, from a human genetics specialist to a courtier, came to the rehearsal.
"Om"Obani" is not an easy thing, each choir voice has its own text, in addition to a completely foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to Unaids, the United Nations AIDS programme, there are about 34 million HIV-infected people in the world.
23.5 million of them live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans living in Swaziland.
At the same time, more than 40 percent of the population is HIV-positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Eschitz, Voices for Africa found bosses in Germany.
70 of them attend a school that prepares them for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can take on the boss.
It guarantees the child money for school, school uniform and daily hot lunch at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi in the Zulu language means narrator or praiser.
In this room, they don't speak fluently, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been learning songs in this foreign soft language and from time to time even bringing them back to where they first appeared: South Africa.
After all, at a distance of 8733 kilometers in the summer from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitzeni, which depends on the voices of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
There live about 2000 people, some still in simple huts made of clay and straw, among the inhabitants many children.
More than 300 of them were left without their parents who died of the virus.
In Esitzeni, the miniature reflects the disease of the whole of Swaziland: the highest level of HIV infection, the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
Circumcision of the extremity in men, which has been proven to reduce the risk of infection by half, is almost not accepted among the population.
More than forty percent of Swaziland’s population carry the immunodeficiency virus, and death in the middle of the fourth decade is not uncommon.
Choir opened this village on a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, but before that, Imbogni participants saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without school education, a person in a poor country has no chance at all.
At first, it was a private commitment of individual participants – for several euros a year to send the child to school and give him the opportunity to receive hot food once a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the Voices for Africa association, which since then has almost professionally taken care of the AIDS orphans in Essijeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most important diseases that are transmitted sexually?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and tripper (gonorrhea).
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes, and hepatitis.
Frontal pediculosis and scabies refer to parasitic STIs.
What are the main affected groups?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, at least four out of every five cases of syphilis in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), gonorrhea and human papillomavirus.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults is relatively low, but about 20 per cent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are significantly more common than among other groups of the population.
According to European data, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
Among young people there is also often a human papilloma virus.
How does the number of infections change?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory registration.
The incidence of syphilis, according to the Robert Koch Institute, more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreasing since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This is about a tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate a venereal disease?
With infectious diseases, there may be ulcers in the genital area, complaints of urination, discharge, pain in the lower abdomen, as well as blisters or tightness.
However, they are often not accompanied by pain and other symptoms and remain unnoticed.
How can I protect myself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but do not provide 100% protection.
After all, partially pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be spread by contact infection and with close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular screening, especially with frequent changes of sexual partners.
With early diagnosis, it is possible to cure most STIs and avoid distant consequences.
The leadership, the donations and, last but not least, the fees for the performances of the choir throughout Germany allow us to collect something.
“In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Essen,” says Annet Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, money from Germany is at the disposal of Tzodva Dlamini, a conscious and active woman.
She also takes care that the orphans are well-groomed, for example, in one of the grandmothers.
Gogos, as the Zulu call old women, is the backbone of the village.
Some of them took in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and make sure that children in uniform showed up every day on time for lessons.
Those who don’t have any relatives come to the shelter of Hanisila, a single woman who receives a salary from the union, as well as two cooks who prepare every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, Voices for Africa organized a sewing school, built two chicken coops, and jointly with the U.S. health organization PSI organized HIV testing for many villagers.
It is hard to imagine, but about the disease, which is so obvious throughout the country, they prefer to be deeply silent.
King with 14 wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annet Lennartz, “because it’s linked to sexuality.”
It is quite unusual for a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his love of excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a state-sanctioned lifestyle is also to blame for the fact that the HIV virus has spread so quickly in recent years.
But it also lies on the wandering workers who spread the virus across the country.
Free condoms are literally on every corner, says Annet Lennartt, “but they’re hardly used.
Another culture is the flesh to the flesh.”
To support a little cultural exchange, the Ibmogni choir makes a trip to southern Africa every two to three years and sings songs full of sadness, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-awareness that many on the southern edge of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people who sing songs in black language - such recognition not only brings good mood and joy, but even, happened, caused tears in the eyes of harsh border guards.
The trip always leads also to Esitzeni, where the singers visit the foster children.
Despite the fact that a small village can hardly be found on the map, in the valley of the Etsulveni river it is more than known.
"Go to Esitzen, there is light," say the local people.
And after the 8733-kilometer flight back to Heidelberg, when the drowning singers return to the rehearsal hall on Bergheimer Street, you can see that this light burns here as well.
Messenger: NASA Opens Up Ice on Mercury <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet can be up to 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has proven the presence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is located closest to the Sun, there is also frozen water, according to three studies published Thursday in the special journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that a region of the planet that is constantly in the shadow is covered with ice.
Its thickness should be at least 30 centimeters, and possibly even up to 20 meters.
Supposedly, the water comes from a comet or possibly an asteroid that collided with Mercury.
No one associates the discovery of ice with the existence of life on the planet, said the probe’s scientific director, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
However, these discoveries could help explain how water and other building elements of life have gotten to other places in the solar system.
Unnoticed to Earth’s inhabitants, probes, telescopes and small robots, such as the Phoenix, explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to Earth: small windows into infinite daisies.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres, according to a new definition of the International Astronomical Union from 2006, is not a "planet".
This fragment of the infrared image of the Spitzer telescope represents a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars in the form of blue dots, it is more difficult to identify pink "newborn" stars in the star circle.
This region of star formation – scientists call it W5 – was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This superimposed heat of a dying star was photographed by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
A donut-like ring consists of material that the star has thrown away in the process of dying.
In the gigantic Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars emerge from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope took this picture of the galactic birth chamber.
The Pleiades star cluster, also called the Seven Sisters, can be seen at night with the naked eye.
Of course, with a telescope, colors get better.
How the red eye dazzles the observer of the Snail Nebula in this infrared image.
It is located at a distance of 700 light-years in the constellation Aquarius.
Similarity to the Earth's continent brought this nebula the nickname "North America".
The combination of normal and infrared photography provides an expressive color transmission.
This new star in all its beauty was photographed only with the help of infrared sensors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they came into being is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
Perhaps these are fragments of Saturn’s moon, which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and clearest images of the Hubble Space Telescope: the Aquarius galaxy
Depending on the color transmission, images of spiral galaxies are transformed into real works of art.
Published by the European Southern Observatory, the image shows the Triffid Nebula in the constellation Sagittarius several thousand light-years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (three-dimensional, three-part), as the dark bands of dust divide the heart of the hot cradle of the stars into three parts.
In the constellation of the Snake, astronomers photographed the harbinger of a cosmic collision: at a distance of 400 million light-years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies collide and inevitably collide.
This birth of the star of the Hubble Space Telescope was filmed in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical cuts can call it by the nickname "Southern Tissue Wheel".
A photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a fragment of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula, which is 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust particles that are ten to one hundred times smaller than ordinary household dust.
This image was composed of optical and X-ray images of various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was photographed by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.
The large spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
In this stellar nebula is the brightest group of new stars in our Milky Way.
The star cluster is constantly creating new stars.
This stellar cloud, connected to the Rosetta Nebula, is also constantly creating new stars — at a distance of 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this brightly glowing galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
The researchers suggest that it originated shortly before the Big Bang, when the universe was mostly hydrogen.
Our views of the universe: the most important telescopes
Probably, the telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lippersge, even before Galileo Galilei began observing the stars a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have become more and more - and the space available to their view is getting deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror depicted here had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the “Big Binocular Telescope” is installed.
It allows you to look into space with two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The Gran Telescopio Canarias has a giant internal device – the diameter of a single mirror is 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the "Big South African Telescope" in South Africa is segmented - in order to reduce the cost.
However, in diameter it reaches about eleven meters.
Lack of inexpensive design: the telescope is rigidly fixed at a vertical angle - this limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberley Telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
Its feature: high light-emitting ability.
It reaches - despite the relatively small diameter of the mirror - the parameters of the largest telescopes in the world.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening to extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
By participating in the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) project, any computer owner can help by providing their computing power.
View of the European Astronomical Service (ESO) Observatory in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the "Very large telescope" - fully corresponding to its name.
Its four mirrors allow you to illuminate in the visual tube even the average infrared spectrum.
ESO is also planning to install a European Very Large Telescope at the Chilean Observatory.
Its main mirror should be spread over 42 meters - and will be made up of almost 1000 mirror elements.
However, photos should not be expected before 2018.
Until 2007, both Keck telescopes on Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They have two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which along with them also looks at the sky with the help of the Subaru and IRTTF telescopes.
In addition, a new giant telescope should appear on Mauna Kea - with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
Here you can see them in illustrations.
However, the most important species from space is supplied by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has been supplying paintings of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for planets outside the solar system, primarily those on which life is possible.
On February 2, 2011, NASA reported that 1,235 candidate planets had been discovered since the start of the mission.
The photo shows the latest preparations of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space no earlier than 2018 aboard the Ariane 5 rocket.
The main mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope: it must look for the light of the first stars and galaxies for the Big Bang.
Scientists suggest that there is ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data on this, as the Messenger revolves closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements over the decades have indicated that there is ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger probe launched in 2004, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now confident of this.
Drink oil every day - and live to 168 years
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically-honored age.
There is even a museum here.
Searching for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many residents reach a biblically-honored age.
There is even a museum here.
Searching for a solution in a country where 97-year-olds seem still relatively young.
A trip through the Talysh Mountains can be called wild and romantic.
A noisy minibus rolls along a winding road past thickly forested hills, tumultuous sayings and simple peasant houses.
Everything around you is so green and bright that you can think of yourself as being in Schwarzwald.
But it is the southernmost border of Azerbaijan, the Iranian border is only a few kilometers away.
The Talyshi live here - one of the peoples of the Caucasus, about which little is known, except that they speak perfectly in Farsi and Azerbaijani and differ in longevity.
The final stop is Lerick.
The small town is teeming with too heavy a Soviet-era architecture, which is not at all in harmony with the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the road from the Azerbaijani capital Baku is too tiring.
At 323 kilometers, it takes eight hours, since the road has only one lane.
The legendary wealth to which the country owes the oil of the Caspian Sea, here, in the province, has not yet reached.
However, Pilate Fatulaeva (48) is convinced that in Lerik there is something to interest tourists.
"In May Baku was famous for the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we will have a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulaeva.
She is the director of the museum of longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is a documented biography of about eight dozen talyshas from these places, which are more than 100 years old. Fatulaeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he's 120 years old.
At the age of 136, he had another child.
But the controversial star of the museum is the chaban Shirali Muslyumov, who allegedly turned 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate, however.
And given that the oldest person, whose age was confirmed by documents, turned 122 years old, the age of Muslyumov seems extremely doubtful.
“He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973,” Fatulaeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he allegedly had a daughter.
Has the Chaban of the Muslims added a couple of decades to his age?
After all, even Rembrandt Scholz, an age researcher from the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, had heard of long-term residents in Central Asia.
“A surprisingly large number of elderly people can also be found in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” says Scholz, “there are also extremely many very old people living in Sardinia.”
However, due to the lack of documents, scientific confirmation of age is not possible, since there were no civil status registers.
Every day a glass of warm oil
Nevertheless, there is a fact that people in the Lerick area strikingly often reach Bible age.
There are now 20 people over 100 years old.
Why are there so many long-term residents in the south?
The Azerbaijani tour guide Farid Mugimzade explains this with the special genes of talisha.
The director of the Fatulaev Museum, on the contrary, believes that it is a matter of nutrition.
Talyshi loves meat, bread and most of all dairy products, many of them drink a glass of warm oil every day. However, such a high-calorie diet is unlikely to be healthy from a dietary point of view.
Or is it a case of a primitive way of life that preserves people's youth? In Chengemaran, a tiny village near the city of Lerik, lives Rubab Mirzoyeva.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzaeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a barrel of oil, which she tirelessly rides back and forth.
There are eight people living under one roof, including one of Mirzaeva’s sons and daughter, who have long had their grandchildren.
There will also be two kids in the vicinity.
In the kitchen, guests prepare tea, which is served in typical cramped glasses of armuda.
Mirzaeva has perfectly straight and strong white teeth, under the headboard she hides long dark-blue braids, which her son proudly reveals to us.
I always have my hair with milk, so they never fall out and retain color.
“And I’ve never used shampoo,” says Mirzaeva.
Monthly pension is enough for life.
She always ate only what grew in her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
I have never bought food in a store in my life.
Then she tells about her husband, who served in the army.
The worst was after the Second World War.
But it got better when Heydar Aliyev’s “favorite father” got in the driver’s seat.
Propaganda doesn’t often sound like an old woman’s speech.
However, the cult created around the figure of the father of the nation, who ruled the country as a dictator, in Azerbaijan knows almost no borders.
He was in power until 2003, after which his son Ilham took over.
However, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijani elderly.
230 manats (about the same amount of euros) Mirzaeva receives monthly as a pension, for local conditions this is an amount for which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzaeva’s long-grown son is also right: “The elderly in our culture have a deep respect.”
They live in a big family, loved ones, surrounded by care and happy.
There’s no reason to stay alive as long as possible.
The word "human rights" is not in the Constitution.
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Competing demonstrations in Cairo are evidence of the country’s deep divisions.
The future constitution, based on sharia law, has met with fierce resistance.
The Egyptian president did not pay attention to the paphos.
We need to create a transition.
“And his success lies in my responsibility to the people and to God,” he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, but primarily to Christian Copts, liberals, enlightened Muslims, and non-religious Egyptians.
After all, all of them, still hopelessly divided in the lost opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a religious state in the Nile at the mercy of powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohammed Morsi, almost apologizing, said he had temporarily curtailed the constitutional court’s jurisdiction and expanded his jurisdiction “to save the revolution.”
However, what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save is not quite clear to the Egyptians and the whole world.
Will the judiciary be deprived of power?
In fact, 234 articles were able to be dragged in a 15-hour night jump with obstacles at an Islamist-minded constitutional assembly of 100 participants, and this is partly a cause for concern.
As in the previous constitutions, the draft states that the trial is based on the “principles of Islamic law”.
But what does "principles" mean?
This has been and remains a matter of interpretation, and it can be feared that Islamists will use vague wording and the resulting legal loophole for a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
At least one new article suggests this: Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamist institution, should be brought to the council in all matters relating to the sharia, which has great authority in all Sunni Islam.
This should not, but could mean that the clergy are supervising the legislation, which would de facto have the effect of limiting the judiciary.
In the draft Constitution, much is the subject of interpretation.
Another problem: the jurisdiction of civilians in the military court must remain.
These courts during Mubarak’s rule served to suppress the opposition.
After the overthrow of the dictator, there were up to 11,000 civilians in military detention.
Also, as stated in the draft, the state must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “maintain its morals and values”.
Legally, this is so vague that state institutions will be able to control even the content of film and literature with the help of this article.
Open text means nothing more than censorship.
In general, no article directly establishes equality between men and women.
But the other forbids insulting and perverting the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what the offense is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The wording that “insulting people” is prohibited is also questionable.
Will there be enough cartoons on the president or jokes about the law?
The question of interpretation, as well as much in this project, which Morsi proposes for signature and which, according to him, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians in a referendum.
“The Revolution is Back”
For several weeks now, an opposition has been formed against the superiority of Islamists.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unanimity on Friday evening in Cairo’s Tahrir Square and vowed to destroy the document before it could enter into force.
“The revolution is back and we will win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who took third place in the presidential election.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohammed ElBaradei, said the draft constitution had a place “in the dustbin of history.”
Through Twitter’s short news service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to lead “a coup against democracy.”
"If he announces a referendum, we will go to his palace and take him down," opposition leader Yasser Said said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been avenged," opposition politician Khaled Ali's Egyptian media quoted him as saying.
Many judges also said they did not want to watch the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, in turn, called for the opposite demonstration, but, with caution, not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of the Cairo University.
It was attended by a large number of women under the veils and Salafi adherents who shouted: “The people demand the application of God’s law.”
They demanded of Morsi: "Cleanse the land!" and assured him: "The Qur'an is our constitution."
The struggle for power over the symbolic square, on which it all began, provoked a state of almost civil war.
Morsi's followers obviously didn't want to take that risk.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both opponents and supporters of the draft constitution spoke out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
For most Islamists, this is considered a decided thing.
“The concept of ‘human rights’ is never mentioned.”
Hafiz Abu Saeed is furious at this forced constitutional process, which, in fact, was supposed to last until February with the participation of all public forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and the chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he shared their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, sentenced, arrested.
And now the words "human rights" are never found in the new constitution, he regrets in conversation with "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Morsi’s influence to all three branches of government in the state disappoints the lawyer.
These measures represent clear blows to the democratic rules of the game and will lead the Egyptians to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening the civilian state, the president de facto annulled it,” Saeed said.
Without civil society organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that everyone has left him, even the international community, which looks at the ideological struggle of the directions on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
There may be a reward for this.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns, “You’re creating a monster that you can’t control.”
Norwegian rakfisk: the most smelly fish in the world?
Norway’s population of five million is one of the highest living standards not only in Europe, but also worldwide.
Perhaps the secret of this country’s success is somehow linked to a local addiction to one extremely sinister fish dish?
Take a few overripe pieces of cheese.
Put them in a bunch of dirty and sweaty sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You will get a pungent smell of rakfisk - one of the most famous Norwegian delicacies.
I'm in a small town called Fagernes, three hours' drive from Oslo.
Around the snow-covered picturesque views. It is very beautiful, but in the air there is an inexhaustible characteristic smell.
Rakfisk is a trout, sprinkled with salt and floating in the water for up to a year, depending on what kind of soul you need to achieve.
As dusk thickens and cools, crowds of Norwegians gather for a festival in Fagernes, dedicated to this very, let’s say, exciting dish.
“They eat it raw and drink it with a hint of aquavit, the local vodka,” explains Howard Halvarsen, a local firefighter by profession and co-founder of the “Raccoon General” who runs the festival.
All around us people eat fish cut in small cubes and drink it in large portions of alcohol.
“Somebody likes aquavit more than rakfisk,” says Howard.
This drink is able to stop the smell.
I'll try a couple of pieces.
If you manage to carry a piece under your nose, then everything is not so bad - little is different from the portion of land that you have carried with you for a long time on the bus.
Rakfisk is a Norwegian product from very different times, times of poverty, when, even before the appearance of refrigerators, fish were soaked in hermetically sealed barrels with salt water in the autumn.
Then, in the deep winter, when the fish had already thoroughly and thoroughly fertilized, it was extracted and, after smothering the perception of alcohol, consumed in food.
In memory of the last generation, the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work and emigrate, mainly to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, who are attracted by jobs, high salaries and a developed social security system.
Residents of Sweden (a long-time rival, and not so long ago and a much more sheltered neighbor) come here en masse to work.
Rakfisk is perceived as an important symbol, an indispensable, though somewhat sinister, element of Norway’s past.
It is one of the most expensive local dishes.
On the other hand, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich will cost you <0xC2><0xA3>9 ($14).
Norway rarely appears in the world’s news, and most of the country’s residents seem to like it.
People here are still reluctant to mention the name of Anders Breivik, a racist and right-wing extremist who shot and killed 77 men, women and children last year.
Without mentioning his name, the attack is called “the July 22 incident.”
It is very difficult for Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their fellow citizens was capable of such atrocities and murders.
Norway’s current prosperity is based on the growth (since the early 1970s) of one of the largest oil and gas industries in the world.
“Oil, however, is not the only reason for our prosperity,” says Anna, our waitress, carrying trays with a durable rakfisko, a woman with long light hair and strikingly blue eyes, the embodiment of Nordic well-being.
We are a people of understanding, as you call it.
Like most Norwegians, she speaks excellent English.
We don't like to show off, we don't brag.
Norway is very careful with its oil - most of the revenues of the oil and gas industry is invested in a special fund created for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was squandering money they didn’t have, Norway was carefully calculating all costs.
“As long as you can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, that’s enough for happiness,” says Anna.
"And there's rakfisk," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow in the queue for some food - rakfiska is enough for me.
Here is a hamburger with salmon meat - it's definitely exotic, delicious juicy meat.
But in the evening we are waiting for even more of the same fish with an unforgettable smell.
In my hotel there is a special dinner dedicated to rakfisk, during which visitors by voting determine the best or perhaps the most fragrant fish.
There's a live TV show showing the leader in a tie-button, surrounded by plates with rakfisko.
This is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"So, Thor Jurgen, what's your assessment of the best fish out there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Howard, here's our assessment."
Everyone laughs and applauds.
Someone falls from a chair, perhaps by taking over the aquavit.
Or maybe just the smell of that fish.
Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto will have a difficult start to his career.
As Mexican President-elect Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant invites us to look at the difficulties he will face and the mixed expectations of his country’s population.
The traffic in Mexico City is in a particularly dire state.
This city is overcrowded with transport and at the best of times, and since Monday, steel dams have been erected that cut several key highways to the capital and caused chaos on the roads.
However, this was done not to prevent people from getting to work from the suburbs, but to prevent protesters from getting to the parliament building.
On Sunday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, will wear a presidential tie and take the country’s reins.
He has a difficult task ahead of him.
Mexico has achieved good economic performance under the administration of Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, who is now in power, but the country is immersed in the war on drugs, which in six years has already claimed about 60,000 lives.
“My government is declaring to the people of Mexico its readiness to fight violence,” Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the White House earlier this week.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Prior to such statements, Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto's political career developed alongside the President of the United States as governor of his native Mexico State.
In his homeland, in the densely populated and vast state surrounding the country's capital, opinions about the new leader were divided.
A straight-line man
In the idyllic town of Valle de Bravo, for example, it is remembered with warmth.
Residents credit him with the revival of tourism, the development of the resort area and the creation of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new highways built by Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, which are very different from the roads with quarries and pits that were previously at this place.
The plaques with his name hang on the modern building of the sports center and on the impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We are linking him with the hopes of real and serious change,” says his friend and political ally, Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a state congressman from the Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto-led Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
We look forward to the real and decisive changes that are so urgently needed in our country, especially in the area of security and economic development.
After 81 years of continuous rule, PRI was ousted in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olivera admits that after his 12-year absence from the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high hopes for Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
In addition, he denies the accusations of inconsistency put forward by the opposition to the new president.
He is very straightforward and very committed to the realization of his vision of the future of the country.
He is an excellent statesman and, above all, a man who is able to listen.
But in another part of the state, many people have a different idea about the former governor.
The municipality of Nesaualkoyotl, also known as Ciudad Nesa, is the most striking contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle de Bravo.
Hidden under the highways, it is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the municipality also have a severe character of this metropolis.
Earlier this year, troops had been drawn in to appease the drug-trafficking gangs in these areas, and violence against women was particularly acute.
In the last two years alone, several dozen bodies of murdered women have been found in the desert near a large dump.
More than a thousand women were killed in Mexico City during the governorate of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, far exceeding that figure in the notoriously violent city of Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, whose name has come to be called when it comes to the murder of innocent women.
According to Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto ' s opponents, he could at best be said to have been unable to cope with the problem of killing women during his tenure as governor.
At worst, his administration is accused of completely ignoring the problem.
A resident of a concrete house, similar to most houses in this weary area, Irineya Buendia is struggling to contain her tears by showing me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes she was killed by her co-habitant.
“When I got to her house, it looked like her body had been washed before,” Buendia recalls.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the body was already cut.
Mariana’s mother retells this story, and the portrait of her daughter looks at us from the wall, where he hangs next to the crucifix, on which is written only one word: justice.
That’s what they said was denied to the family.
“The state officials treated me like an old gossip girl, an unsatisfied disturber of peace.
They want people to just believe everything they say and keep quiet.
But it’s not right, it’s not possible, especially when there are so many violations and shortcomings around,” she says.
Wearing a presidential tie on Saturday, President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto will take on a difficult responsibility with her.
Over the past six years, tens of thousands of families in Mexico have been affected by violence-related crimes, and the new president has promised to make addressing the issue a priority during his presidency.
“I hope he will be exactly the same president that he was as governor,” says Olvera, a congressman from Valle de Bravo from the PRI party.
However, that is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Ness are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning has not complained of ill-treatment, the prosecution claims.
Prosecutors are trying to refute Bradley Manning’s allegations of poor detention conditions.
The hearing focused on Manning's stay in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence demands that the case be closed on the grounds that Manning’s conditions of detention were cruel.
The U.S. military is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents.
On Friday, the prosecution tried to prove that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of classified material in U.S. history, did not take advantage of numerous opportunities to file a complaint of ill-treatment, which he said he had to endure while in the military.
During the cross-examination at a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, the military prosecutor Major Ashden Feyn stated that the records of Manning's weekly visits by the prison administration for nine months of his detention in Quantico, Virginia, were not severable.
A cross-examination of the defence's application to terminate Manning's case on the grounds that the conditions of his detention were cruel and in itself sufficient punishment was conducted the day after Manning stated that he intended to commit suicide while in detention.
A military intelligence analyst arrested in June 2010 has been charged with the theft of several thousand classified documents during his service in Iraq.
These materials were subsequently published on the Internet on the WikiLeaks website.
WikiLeaks did not confirm that the source of the information was Manning.
During Friday's hearing, Prosecutor Fein along with Manning reviewed the reports, which were filled out after Manning's visits by administration officials during his stay in Quantico prison, where he was under strict detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
During the visits, prison officials asked Manning questions and recorded his answers.
When Prosecutor Fein asked about the reports on Friday, Manning admitted that he considered the prison administration’s treatment of him as “excellent” and the general conditions of detention as “very professionally organized.”
The reports in question do not contain complaints of ill-treatment, despite Manning being asked directly about the conditions of its contents, Feyn argues.
Manning replied that he had expressed verbal concern about these problems and that the administration officials who had visited him had discussed these problems with him and stated that they would deal with them but had not recorded them in writing.
“They recorded ‘no problems’ (after discussing my complaints), but that doesn’t mean I didn’t raise the issue in the conversation,” Manning says.
A military judge, Colonel Denise Linde, also asked Manning why he had not complained of ill-treatment to him in January 2011 during a commission hearing considering the suicidal intentions he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning responded that during that meeting he wanted to have the “preventing injury” regime removed and the conditions of detention relaxed.
The military leadership explained that a limited detention regime – at a level lower than the suicide-prevention surveillance regime – was introduced to protect the prisoner, as well as the safety of others.
“I wanted to let the administration know that I’m okay with them cancelling the trauma prevention regime ... so that my life level improves, from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to a prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He reported that he had thoughts of suicide in Kuwait, and that one day he lost consciousness due to severe heat.
He explained that it is psychologically very difficult when you are not told how your fate is decided and what is happening in the outside world.
“My world has shrunk to the base of Camp Ariphant, to the size of my prison,” Manning said Thursday.
“I thought I was going to die in this cage.”
While in Quantico, Manning said he spent most of his time in a small cell — at least 21 hours, and often more than 23 hours a day — in complete solitude.
Manning reports that he was allowed to leave only a mattress, blanket, slippers, several items of clothing and glasses.
He says he tried to move, as sleeping or even just lying in the daytime prohibited the rules.
According to Manning, in his sleep, his eyes were constantly struck by light penetrating from outside the camera.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned in bed at night, then, according to him, he was woken and forced to turn his back.
Manning's lawyer filed a formal objection to Manning's wrongful treatment in January 2011.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to a military prison in Fort Livenworth, Kansas.
In addition, on Friday, the judge questioned Manning about a statement he made while testifying on Thursday that, after being forced to sleep naked in his cell in Quantico one night, he was forced to stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning check.
Manning said he was unable to cover himself with a blanket during the inspection.
Responding to a judge’s question on Friday, Manning said he understood from a guard’s order that he should drop a blanket that he could hide, but admitted that no one directly ordered him to drop it.
Manning said on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of his attempt to show an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning said he told the officer that he could use a rubber band of panties or panties to injure himself, but did not.
That night, according to Manning, his underwear, slippers and glasses were taken from the camera.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account what he has had to go through during his detention and will significantly reduce his sentence if Manning is found guilty by a military court that is due to begin hearing his case early next year.
The defense said it plans to offer Manning to plead guilty to less serious crimes and challenge other charges as excessive.
The reopening of the hearings is scheduled for this weekend, and the prosecution is expected to insist that the conditions of detention have been justified.
The Pentagon claims that Manning was detained at Quantico in accordance with rules governing the detention of those arrested under the most stringent regime.
The charges against Manning include complicity with the enemy, illegal facilitation of the publication of data on the Internet, the transfer of information relating to national defense, and the theft of state property or documents.
If convicted under all paragraphs of the indictment, he could face life imprisonment.
My crisis of national self-determination is the story of an American of Mexican origin.
According to the author, many Mexicans were forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities to realize themselves.
Mexicans tend to blame those who left because they remind the people of the country of difficult times.
Ruben Navarrette believes that Mexicans of American origin are torn between two cultures.
During a recent trip to Mexico City, I passed through the arrivals corridor, approached the border control zone and froze on the spot.
The signs indicated two lines: one for Mexicanos (Mexicans), the second for Extranjeros (foreigners).
I stood in front of them for a few seconds, not knowing where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I've been called a Mexican all my life.
It’s just a conventional name, like how my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and friends in New York consider themselves Italian.
Later, I stopped at the complex design of “American of Mexican origin”.
But here I was in Mexico.
Here, in my grandfather’s homeland, there was no need for conditional names or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish well enough to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocabulary is poorer than the speakers of the language, and I can’t get rid of the American accent.
That's why I got my U.S. passport and turned in for Extranjeros.
I recalled this story a few days ago when newly elected Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto visited the White House and met with President Obama.
On the agenda were the usual issues for the meetings of the presidents of these countries: immigration, drugs and trade.
President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto willingly spoke about the rise of the Mexican economy, thanks to which Mexicans will now, with the same success, be able to stay in Mexico, instead of moving to the United States.
He wants to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc like the European Union.
In addition, President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto promised to continue the war against drug cartels in Mexico, but no specific proposals were made.
For Mexico, relations with the United States are a difficult and time-honored issue.
Most Americans never thought about the fact that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and, under the tutelage of rifles, forced its leaders to abandon half of their territory.
But Mexicans think for centuries, not minutes, and see reminders of those events in everything.
Therefore, it is only necessary for any U.S. statesman to moan at least a word of criticism towards Mexico, in the press and among the elites of Mexican society immediately distributed complaints that Americans are encroaching on the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the descendants of Montezuma are filled with belligerence.
At the same time, Mexico’s relationship with more than 35 million Americans of Mexican origin living in the United States is the most complex.
Want to talk about insults?
They're enough.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people who find opportunities in this country for themselves, and those for whom there are no such opportunities.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, so many people of Mexican descent have only one reason: at some point in their family history, someone – a father or grandfather – had no opportunity to realize himself in Mexico and was forced to go north.
Most often, they were Mexicans of a certain type - sluggish, poorly educated, from poor peasant families.
We are their descendants, and we remember that.
In Mexico, they see it differently.
Today, our life is the embodiment of the American dream, we studied in good schools and got a good job, but we do not forget that even this dream is American, not Mexican.
Our national self-determination is confused and unclear, but we know which country to consider as our own.
United States of America.
Besides, we know that the majority of the Mexican elite and the ruling class do not like us.
We answer them the same.
They see us as a reminder of humiliating defeats and treat us as second-class people, as non-real Mexicans.
We do not speak Spanish well enough, and our ties with Mexico are not strong enough.
Our very existence for them is explained by failures.
If our ancestors had succeeded in Mexico, they would not have left.
We would not be behind a silk curtain now, finding a rich life in the United States, but losing spiritual ties.
My wife was born in Guadalajara and legally moved to the United States as a child, and this reminds me that there are certain frictions between real Mexicans and Americans of Mexican origin - Mexicans understand their national identity more clearly, and Americans of Mexican origin it.
She is a U.S. citizen and believes she belongs to both countries.
At the same time, many of my fellow Americans of Mexican descent do not feel belonging to any of them.
We listen to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
When you get the best of both worlds, you inevitably lose your roots.
We are Americans in Mexico.
In the United States, we are called Mexicans.
Now, as I found out during my trip, as if our relations were not already sufficiently complicated, some Mexican leaders and representatives of the intelligentsia want to restore relations with the diaspora.
They want Americans of Mexican descent to work as ambassadors to Mexico and represent their interests in the United States.
We could tell our American friends about what a beautiful country it is and how great it is to visit, and we could convince political leaders to strengthen ties with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Nothing's gonna work out.
Too many insults in the past.
And given the gap between the rich and the poor, the rampant corruption and drug trafficking, many of us do not consider this country so beautiful.
I'm sorry, but deal with it yourself, amigos.
And that's fair.
If some Mexicans still can’t forgive the United States for what they did to Mexico a century and a half ago, they’ll have to accept the fact that some Mexican Americans are still offended by how their relatives have been treated in Mexico recently.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Maybe we have more in common than I thought.
The Old Battles in the New Middle East
A cease-fire agreement between Israel and the Hamas group could become a fragile foundation for a future world.
Is a long-term peace between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East possible?
Another round of bloodshed leads to the conclusion that such hopes are in vain.
The usual, meaningless disputes about who started it first sound; many buildings are turned into ruins; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed, and six Israelis have been killed; for the first time during the conflict, rockets fired from the territory of the Gaza Strip have fallen in the vicinity of the capital.
However, despite the fact that the Israelis and Palestinians have hopelessly entwined in their age-old conflict, changes have come to the Middle East.
This can be treated in different ways, but the events of the “Arab Spring” have surrounded many established realities in a storm of rebellion, and Palestinians and Israelis have failed to stay away from the vortex that shook the region.
Perhaps, as a result, their struggle will become even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to hope for a way out of this deadly stalemate.
War Without Winners
At first glance, the situation does not give cause for optimism.
Even if the ceasefire, which was signed on November 21, will be implemented, the clashes this week have only strengthened the positions of the security forces on both sides.
The leaders of the Islamist Hamas movement, which came to power in the Gaza Strip in 2007, say they have forced Israel to back down despite the losses they have suffered.
Despite the fact that some leaders of the group have been destroyed, and 1.7 million residents are blocked in one of the most densely populated and troubled corners of our planet, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is growing in popularity on the West Bank of the Jordan River, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by the more moderate Fatah movement.
Moreover, Hamas leaders may well conclude that time is working for them.
As the influence of Islamist movements in the Arab world grows, Hamas has new influential and rich friends.
A resurgent regional leader, Turkey, which was once Israel’s closest ally among Muslim countries, has come out in support of Hamas; her example was followed by Qatar, one of the Gulf’s richest and most dynamically developing states.
Hamas supporters are calling for the creation of an Islamist crescent moon around Israel, from Lebanon in the north, ruled by a paramilitary Hezbollah group, to Syria, where increasingly pro-Islamist rebels are about to overthrow Bashar al-Assad’s power, and then to the kingdom of Yor.
The most significant change in the balance of power in the region occurred on the southern borders of Israel, in the most populous and important Arab country, in Egypt, where under President Mohamed Morsi the influence of the Muslim Brotherhood movement was strengthened.
Hosni Mubarak, who ruled Egypt for 30 years and was overthrown in 2011, was a secular dictator who paid little attention to supporting Hamas.
The Muslim Brotherhood, on the other hand, is an organization much like Hamas, and its leaders are more prone to populism.
In future diplomatic situations, Hamas may become a significant player, whose voice will not be silenced even by Israel and America.
At the same time, supporters of the “hard” line in Israel will come to the opposite conclusion.
In the military sense, Hamas was defeated.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system justified the cost of its creation and successfully destroyed many of the launched Hamas missiles.
The citizens of Israel can sleep peacefully for at least some time.
As for diplomacy, the United States remained true to its unwavering position; many European countries also blamed Hamas for the start of the last round of violence.
Another important factor is the economic prosperity of Israel, especially under the government of Benjamin Netanyahu, who largely ignored the peace process.
Despite the fact that since 2004, about 30 Israelis have been killed by rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, Israel has not managed to minimize the problem of terrorists-killers, in part due to the wall that enters the West Bank of the Jordan River - a significant part of the state is not recognized.
The position of Prime Minister Netanyahu, whose Likud party - in preparation for the elections scheduled for January 22nd - has been united with even more aggressive conservatives led by Avigdor Lieberman, is very convenient.
What is the point of worshipping the Palestinians and giving them their own state?
If they are given all the power in the West Bank, will they not start launching rockets at Israel from there, as their fellow citizens in the Gaza Strip do?
It is better to keep them behind the wall and hard suppress any attempts to raise their heads.
Supporters of the “hard” line may win; however, their calculations may be refuted in the Arab Spring.
While Islamists, who come to power in Egypt and other countries, do not have the warmest feelings for Israel, their priority will be domestic problems.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than all of its Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with a regional superpower is unlikely to help Arab governments strengthen their own economies.
The pragmatism of President Morsi, who worked with Barack Obama to end the fire, is a good sign and could mark the beginning of change.
Israel, no less, must take into account the long-term consequences of its policies.
As democratic change unfolds in Arab countries, the deprivation of Palestinian self-determination is a slow-moving bomb that will sooner or later explode in Israeli-occupied territories, like a bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already undermines the foundations of democratic order in the Jewish state, and the demographic aspect – the growth of the Arab population – only exacerbates these problems.
The bloody operations that are carried out every few years in the Gaza Strip to suppress the Hamas movement have to be paid for by the growing discontent of the international community.
Both sides need an external impulse.
The only solution that remains to be called upon tirelessly by sane representatives from both sides, as well as much of the rest of the world and our newspaper, is the formation of two states and the surrender of territories by Israel in exchange for security.
There remains hope, not too impressive in the short term, that the ceasefire will allow other countries to influence the sides of the conflict more effectively.
Egypt, which has long decided to cut off arms supplies to the Gaza Strip, as well as Turkey and Qatar, has a more favourable position than ever before in order to persuade Hamas to recognize the borders of the Jewish state adopted since 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and the sharing of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also make efforts to reconcile the Hamas and Fatah movements.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than an upcoming UN vote that could result in recognition of Palestine’s virtual statehood.
President Obama must also play his part in putting Israel at the negotiating table.
During his first term, he never presented his own plan for a peaceful settlement.
Upon his return to the White House, he continues to show reluctance to join in on the issue.
This is a disastrously short-sighted position.
The United States is vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This is possible only in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
In Australia, the Uniform Packaging for Cigarettes Act has come into force.
Warnings about the harm of smoking and images of diseased parts of the body are contrasted on gloomy green boxes, the same for all brands of cigarettes.
The first in the world practice Australian law on the same type of packaging of cigarettes and tobacco products came into force, replacing the logos and color design of different brands with the same box of gloomy-olive color with terrible pictures of the diseased parts of the body and images of children whose smoking is healthy.
In addition to the different pictures and inscriptions warning about the harm of smoking, the only difference between the packs, introduced mandatory from this Saturday - the names of the stamps, which are printed in the same small font.
These are the most severe conditions in the world for packaging tobacco products.
The federal government of Australia says that the goal of this measure is to keep young people from smoking, depriving them of this harmful habit of fashion status.
This decision was based on the results of studies that showed that people who did not start smoking before the age of 26 years, in 99 cases out of 100 never become smokers.
“Obviously, even at a very young age, children understand the meaning that tobacco companies are trying to convey through packaging,” Health Minister Tanya Plibersek said, citing research showing that, for example, the crown in the logo is associated with the idea of a princess.
Australia is one of the countries with the lowest share of smokers in the world, so these changes will not have a significant impact on the profits of transnational corporations, but other countries are already considering such measures.
Representatives of the tobacco industry strongly opposed the adoption of this law.
Tobacco companies claim that this will only increase the share of the black market in which cheap and affordable cigarettes will be sold.
“This law will lead to serious consequences other than those conceived by its initiators,” said Scott McIntyre, a spokesman for British American Tobacco in Australia.
Manufacturers of counterfeit goods from China and Indonesia will supply much more of such goods for sale on the streets of Australia.
For some, on the contrary, the new laws contribute to the growth of business.
Sandra Ha of the small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that the demand for cigars and silicone cases that hide unpleasant pictures on the packaging has grown rapidly (virtually from scratch) since two months ago such companies as British American Tobacco, British Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan sued.
According to Sandra Ha, Zico has already sold about six thousand products to wholesalers and is expecting a new batch.
This is a good business for us.
A potential obstacle to the effectiveness of such measures is, according to experts, the popularity of social networks among precisely the part of the population to which these measures are directed.
After Australia passed a series of laws that made cigarette advertising illegal and supported sports events, as well as prohibiting sellers from displaying cigarettes in a prominent place, tobacco advertising moved to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned local companies and websites from placing ads on the network, but it cannot restrict foreign sites from doing so.
“If you’re trading tobacco products and you only have this small loophole left, the idea of promoting your product online will seem extremely tempting to you,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman notes an increase in reviews of brands written by allegedly ordinary users on social networks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
The question arises - is it really a matter of the hands of a private citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes so much that he did not regret the effort and time and made a video, or is it behind the advertising company?
The Australian branch of British American Tobacco says the industry is now more concerned with adapting to the new rules than with advertising.
Representatives of the tobacco industry have even taken measures such as sponsoring Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules: these states make claims within the framework of the World Trade Organization, claiming that trade has been subjected to unfair restrictions, despite the fact that the trade relations of all these countries with Australia are not perfect.
The WTO decision is expected by mid-2013.
According to Tani Plibersek, the government discussed with other countries the possibility of adopting similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first to introduce mandatory placement of smoking-preventing photos.
This rule is now adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of tightening laws is being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia are demonstratively not following the innovations.
These pictures don't bother me.
I'm just not paying attention.
“You just grab a cigarette and hide the packet in your pocket,” explains Victor El Heig, who buys cigarettes with a photograph of the mouth tumor on the packet.
To be honest, the only thing that can make me quit is my little daughter.
James Yu, head of the King of the Pack tobacco store in central Sydney, says that the same packaging has complicated the task of placing goods on shelves
“I used to have an hour to unload the new party, and now four hours,” he complains.
"The government had to take and completely ban cigarettes, we would then say: what to do, okay, it's over, we close the store," he says, taking his hands up.
Getting bored in the world of electronic networks and constant connections is not so bad.
On this Thanksgiving, I suddenly had to spend five hours at the airport, because our plane had mechanical problems and was replaced by another plane, which we were waiting for.
So I had plenty of time to think about the nature of boredom.
I'm not gonna cheat on you.
A half-day at the airport waiting for a flight is really boring, and neither books, magazines, iPhones, nor even duty-free shops will help much here.
However, recently, more and more scientists and specialists on child development are speaking in favor of boredom.
They say that in certain situations for us and for our children to miss is not so bad.
This forces the brain to be distracted by interesting related topics, which may contribute to creativity.
And since in the modern world we are all constantly in front of some screen, the advantages of boredom pass us by.
Maybe we need to get bored?
Oh, yeah.
And at the same time, no.
We'll get back to that.
In the past, I, like many, believed that boredom was an invention of relatively recent times, when people had more free time.
This is not so, says Peter Tui, professor of Greek and Roman history at the Canadian University of Calgary, author of the book “The Fascinating History of Boredness” (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press, 2011).
“In fact, boredom can boast of a very ancient history,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii are found Latin inscriptions about boredom, dating back to the first century.
The question remains as to how we understand boredom.
The problem is, says John D. Eastwood, an adjunct professor at York University in Ontario, Canada, that the understanding and vision of boredom has often changed.
After studying the research materials on this topic and asking a target group of 100 people a question, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the following definition: boredom is when people “want to, but cannot, engage in, what would bring them satisfaction.”
The difference between boredom and apathy, he says, is that a bored person doesn’t do something they would like to do.
I don’t want to do anything with apathy.
The main thing in the experienced boredom, he says, is “a disturbance of attention and the associated deterioration of mood and the feeling that time is slowly stretching.”
According to the description, boredom can seem very similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood argues that despite the possible link between these conditions, bored people see the causes of problems in the world around them and circumstances, and people experiencing depression see problems in themselves.
Sometimes we think we’re bored when it’s really hard for us to focus on something.
In his study, Unoccupied Mind: Determining Boring in Attention, published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and colleagues refer to a previously conducted experiment in which participants listened to a recording of a voice reading the journal.
Some participants also heard loud sounds not related to the TV program included in the neighboring room, others heard the same sounds at low volume, so that they could hardly be disassembled, and the third group listened only to the recording of the voice without a foreign soundtrack.
Those participants who heard the low-volume TV noted that they were bored, more often than others – they found it difficult to concentrate, but they didn’t know the reasons for this and attributed it to boredom.
When we try to focus on a difficult or exciting task, interrupting attention can cause boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neurology at the University of Guelph, Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteresting, such as looking at the flow of products on the conveyor in search of marriage, distracting music can help avoid boredom.
It’s believed that when people start rocking on a chair or drawing caracules on a sheet of paper, they do it out of boredom, but now we know that actually such actions just help not to relax physically.
“The study found that children who are not banned from rowing and spinning learn better and remember more information than children who are required to sit quietly,” says Professor Fenske.
At some point, we all experience boredom: when the flight is delayed (as in my case), listening to a monotonous speech, watching an uninteresting movie.
However, different people have different degrees of boredom.
In the 1980s, to measure such individual features, the researchers developed a special “tenderness to boredom” scale.
Questions and assertions are used to determine the score on such a scale, such as "A lot of what I have to do is monotonous and monotonous" or "I'm too interested in too much, so there's not enough time for anything."
With the help of such questionnaires, the researchers determined that boys miss girls more often, - says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, - especially in the presence of a variety of external stimuli.
However, in general, teenagers often miss.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of personal and social development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he used a pager to reach nearly 400 teenagers and their parents 7-8 times a day.
It got the following results: 32% of teens said they were bored at school and while doing homework, and 23% said they were bored outside of school.
Only 3% of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson notes that he has no data on what such data on boredom would be like now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that “adolescents have a high tendency to be bored,” mainly because children and teenagers are not allowed to fully decide what to do.
Let’s go back to my original question: is boredom helpful?
Sometimes not, because in extreme manifestations, it can, as studies show, push people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risky gambling, or abuse of certain substances in attempts to get rid of boredom.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers have thought about the connection between boredom and creativity, says Professor Vodanovich, who has devoted more than two decades to studying this problem.
“That’s how our brain tells us that we should do something else; that’s boring,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
However, this same brain does not always know what to do best.
If you’re bored and you channel that energy into playing guitar or cooking experiences, you’ll do better.
However, if you start watching TV, you will only get better for a while, and soon it will pass.
Therefore, if your child misses and you give him an iPad, he will stop missing, but he will not learn to fight boredom on his own or in any other way manage his time and employment,” says Professor Fenske.
“And such self-regulation skills are used in a wide variety of situations,” he says.
Your child not only learns to do something on their own, he also learns self-control in general.
I don't think boredom should be celebrated in any way.
However, to consider it a bad thing is also not worth it.
Rather, you should learn to feel comfortable even outside of a continuous stream of action and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
“We see this so that we need to experience boredom more often, while boredom is an extremely unpleasant, irresistible desire to do something meaningful,” he says.
In fact, people tend to somehow disconnect from constant worries and just relax.
“In today’s world, we are used to the constant overstimulation of the senses,” he says, “and when silence comes, we get lost and don’t know what to do.”
It is not yet clear how the new law on the legalization of marijuana will be applied in the state of Colorado.
Anthony Orosko, a nineteen-year-old soccer player and public college student in southeastern Colorado, is accused of committing a criminal offense that will soon be completely legal across the state: storing a small portion of marijuana and the pipe in which he was smoking it.
Mr. Orosco said that one day in September he and his friends were in Lamar and were driving in a prairie car near the Kansas border when they were stopped by police.
After a police officer found marijuana in his car, Mr. Orosco was sent to court for drug possession and possession of a drug-use device — minor offenses, each of which is subject to a $100 fine — and the court date was set.
“We are treated like criminals,” Mr. Orosco says.
But is he a criminal?
As a result of the uncertainty that persists just weeks after Colorado voted to legalize the use of marijuana in small amounts for entertainment, the resolution of hundreds of small court cases depends not so much on the law as on the venue.
Accusations of petty marijuana-related offenses are already being dropped in hundreds of cases here and in Washington State, which has taken a similar measure.
Police stations have already stopped charging people aged 21 and over for storing small doses, which will be considered legal as soon as the law comes into force in a couple of weeks.
However, in more conservative Colorado counties, prosecutors have decided to review existing marijuana-related cases and continue to hold the drug liable.
At the same time, in some cities from the suburbs of Denver to the mountainous areas of the West, voters are voting to prevent the emergence of new, state-licensed marijuana stores in their places.
“It’s all moving so fast that I don’t even know what to expect next,” says Daniel J. Outs, a police chief in the town of Aurora, east of Denver.
Representatives of the controlling bodies in Washington state also puzzled to scratch their heads.
They will have to form rules to determine the procedure for licensing the cultivation, processing, distribution and sale of marijuana, and all this must be done by December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, good or bad, is ahead of most other states in resolving marijuana use issues, first for medical purposes, and now for entertainment.
“There’s a more orderly market in Colorado, so they’ll serve as a good example,” explains Brian I. Smith, a representative of the Council on the Regulation of Alcohol Production and Sales in Washington State.
But now no one can do more, Mr. Smith admits, than put forward some proposals and hope that it will work.
“We don’t have a real precedent that we could focus on,” he says.
The Washington State bill, called I-502, will go into effect on Dec. 6 and throw the state into a state of uncertainty for a whole year when there is no state licensing system yet, and the right to own marijuana is already legal.
And there are still difficult technical aspects to solve in this period, for example, how to find a balance between the state's order on "adequate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on its trade at a distance of 1000 feet from schools, parks, playgrounds and kindergartens.
“It will be particularly difficult to place licensed marijuana businesses within the city limits, particularly in Seattle and its suburbs,” said Ben Livingston, a representative of the newly established research group, the Center for Marijuana Legalization.
On November 21, police chief Oates of Aurora sent an e-mail to his subordinates saying that the city's prosecutor's office would no longer hold people under the age of 21 responsible for possession of a small amount of marijuana, and that the police would stop charging people with these violations.
Police chief Oates said police would monitor compliance in the city with rules governing the activities of marijuana growers for medical purposes and would prosecute illegal drug traffickers and drug dealers.
The Weld County Attorney in North Colorado, Ken Buck, presents a more rigorous approach to the issue.
Following the vote on the bill, he stated that the prosecution would continue to hold marijuana to account, primarily in order to encourage its users to undergo treatment.
At present, 119 individuals have been charged with possession of two or less ounces of marijuana, although many of them are also charged with other offences.
“It is the duty of our institution to prosecute acts that are considered criminal at the time of their commission,” Mr. Buck said in a statement.
The reaction was mixed even in places such as the rural district of Mesa, where voters rejected a proposal to legalize marijuana.
Police in Grand Junction, the largest city in the county, no longer hold adults responsible for possession of a small amount of the drug.
District Attorney Pete Hutzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to drop the charges in open cases related to marijuana storage.
“I believe that it is our direct duty to ensure compliance with the law until it is changed,” he says.
Despite the fact that 55% of Colorado residents who took part in the vote supported this decision, including marijuana use issues for entertainment in the state and legal system will not be easy.
And the contradictory reaction of residents in different places of the state revealed the ambiguity of the attitude of the local authorities to the experiment of the state with marijuana.
“There is a cultural barrier for district prosecutors on this issue,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing the interests of those convicted of marijuana possession, and a local representative of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“They’ve been persecuting people for so long that they can’t really put up with the fact that it’s no longer a crime,” he says.
Colorado and Washington — the first states to have a small amount of marijuana in the same way as alcohol — are destined to become an experimental field on a country-wide scale to test the very idea of legalizing drugs.
Supporters of legalization and state officials plan to expand the territory of legalized trade, but at the same time, they are anxiously awaiting instructions from the federal authorities, who still plan to view the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes.
Supporters of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Office of Justice will concede on this issue.
Despite several widespread arrests of marijuana traffickers and patients on medical records, the federal government has in most cases done well to trade marijuana for medical purposes in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states.
Agents of the Bureau of Narcotics Control are unlikely to break into homes to confiscate a small bag of marijuana, but they are unlikely to turn a blind eye to state-regulated recreational marijuana stores that are allowed under the new law, Kevin A. Sabet says, advising against the issue.
Some cities in Colorado did not wait for the actions of the federal authorities.
Even before the presidential election, some local administrations approved a moratorium on the opening of new shops for the sale of marijuana, which would not have been able to open sooner than a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the western part of the state, proposed a six-month ban on marijuana trade, which is likely to be approved next week.
“We don’t want to be in a position where we’re going to give someone a license and then it’s going to cause serious problems at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we have a contradiction between the results of the local vote and what the state voted for.
There are still a lot of unresolved issues.
Petronella Wyatt: I survived Oxford for being a Conservative.
The persecution of university students for their views did not begin today.
For as long as I can remember, I've always dreamed of going to Oxford University.
My father and older brother studied at Oxford and described it as the world’s best educational institution, a modern analogue of an ancient symposium that laid the two foundations of civilization – freethinking and tolerance.
And yet, after two weeks of studying at the historic faculty of Worcester College at Oxford University in the late 1980s, I picked up my suitcases and left, which turned out to be the first real scandal in my life.
My father couldn't stand it and cried.
My friends were upset with me.
The Evening Standard claimed that I dropped out of college because I didn’t like my classmates having sex in the next room.
The writer E. Normann Wilson joked that I had to leave because I had to drink from the cracked cups.
Actually, it wasn't all that much fun.
I ran away.
Yes, I escaped because I was systematically harassed and intimidated.
Not at all because of my rather unusual name or the fact that I was studying in a private school.
I was harassed for only one reason, and in this glorified cradle of enlightenment it seemed like a real barbarism and blind fanaticism: my father, now deceased Woodrow Wyatt, was a well-known adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I myself was a supporter of the Conservatives.
You may ask, why do you think about it now?
According to the latest data, a new generation of students who adhere to right-center views is subjected to the same harassment.
This institutionalized and ever-growing hatred for conservative students in Oxford is so strong that last week a group of such students demanded the same protection of their rights as that afforded to disabled people, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservatives at Corpus Christi College’s student club in Cambridge state that they are “often actively isolated, subjected to personal attacks and made to feel unwanted guests” because of their political views.
They want to introduce an additional representative to the college's Equal Rights Committee to ensure freedom of expression.
Their situation was only aggravated by the recent BBC 2 documentary about politics in the student environment “The Wonderland: Young, Smart and Right”, in which conservatives were presented by eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
The film featured Joe Cook, a former president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association who rides in a roller-coaster, wears a silver suit and a cane with a silver saddlebag.
At other universities, conservative students complain that they are making “dismissal goats” because of higher tuition fees.
Luke Black, 20, the vice president of the University of Nottingham’s Conservatives Association, said in an interview with one of Sunday’s newspapers that “the university environment is increasing the bias toward left-wing views.
People who don’t even know us consider us in advance to be the brazen and unpunished children of rich parents.”
Samuel Roberts, 21, a student at the historic faculty of Corpus Christi College who was asked to step up his defense, calls the atmosphere "inconvenient," and Stephanie Cherill, 19, the new president of the Oxford University Conservatives Association, says that the attitude of members of the student's club is "inconvenient."
“This poses a threat to both the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and the normal life of the club members,” she says.
The first few weeks at Oxford I was not just in the minority, I was alone.
I arrived there in September 1986, a shy and shy eighteen-year-old girl.
Oxford was feverish in its hatred of the Conservative Party.
A year earlier, the university had voted to deprive former student Margaret Thatcher of her honorary degree due to a reduction in budget allocations for higher education.
Even the Stalinists would be uncomfortable in such an atmosphere.
In the first days of the first week of the first year, when the students met each other and the teachers, I felt for the first time what was waiting for me ahead.
I did not yet know that the teachers not only looked through their fingers at the enthusiasm of conservative students, but also gladly took part in it.
Political issues – the miners’ strike, privatization, and the government’s refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid government in South Africa – penetrated through the wooden-paneled walls of the auditoriums.
At my first seminar I had to translate the French text of the eighteenth century into English, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Miss Wyatt," said the teacher, now deceased Harry Pitt, "please translate the first paragraph."
The text was difficult for me, I was stuck.
Harry Pitt was a very bile person with a cake-like face.
"Thatcherists don't learn French in principle or they just lack brains?" he asked.
The other students nodded.
I had tears in my eyes.
“I advise you to take a few initial lessons of French in your spare time, if you’re certainly not very busy circling around in society,” he said.
I returned to my room completely unlucky.
That night in college, I was sitting at lunch alone; then someone patted me on the shoulder.
It was James, a second-year student from the Faculty of English who introduced himself as a member of the University's Conservatives Association.
“I know who you are,” he said friendlyly.
- Unfortunately, the case is as follows:
Everyone who is suspected of being sympathetic to the Conservatives will be mocked.
It's not easy for me, and in your case, they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be harder for you.
Most of the first-year conservatives pretend to be Labour.”
Later, at a local pub, I tried to be cowardly.
I insisted that I didn't agree with everything Margaret Thatcher said.
The trick didn't work.
A first-year student at the Faculty of Philosophy, Politics and Economics, who himself studied at Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contagious."
Other students took up his words.
I was spoiled, dirty.
“How do conservatives have sex?” one of them asked.
"They're hitting each other, aren't they?"
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt until the abolition of criminal prosecution in the sixties.
Will I ever be able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Or will I have to meet with like-minded people only under the cover of the night?
Will I be forced to become a Labour and hide my true beliefs?
The next three years seemed like hell, full of persecution and loneliness.
The only teacher in my college who didn’t hide his conservative views was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history.
He was hated not only for belonging to the Conservatives, but also for being Thatcher’s foreign policy adviser and one of its spokesmen.
He barely showed up at college.
He despised it for its provinciality, finesse and commitment to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997 he took a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I started to travel to Oxford from my parents’ house in London, trying to find refuge among relatives and unbiased friends of the capital.
I told my father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his studies in the forties, any political views were accepted there.
“But it’s the best university in the world,” he said lamentably.
- They can't do that there, except in the city of sleeping spires...
Even my communist friends have always behaved flawlessly.”
His wet eyes were blurry.
“Don’t make hasty decisions.
I'm sure it's just a joke.
You'll break my heart if you drop out of college."
I was tired of constant trips to London and my emotional defenses were weak.
My friend, also a conservative, could not stand the pressure and gave up his beliefs.
The next week during the seminar, when the next history teacher took me very seriously as the “enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
In my heart of shame, I admitted that "I was brainwashed by my parents" and called them "old fools."
The breath was short.
The last nail in the coffin of my career at Oxford was destined to kill my father.
At the time, he wrote two columns each week for publications owned by Rupert Murdoch.
My door was locked.
I didn't go out, and five minutes later, my pursuers surrendered.
When they left, I picked up my suitcase and boarded the first train to London.
I never came back.
You can call me a squid and a squid.
But at the age of eighteen, no one should become the object of such anger and intimidation in a school.
The saddest thing is that it was Oxford, which not only released fourteen Tory prime ministers, but to this day hides behind the undeserved reputation of a university in which equality and freedom are valued.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
About the exhibition "Valentino: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC talks with Nati Abascal, Fiona Tissen-Bornemica and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Queen Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital to host an exhibition about Valentino Garavani.
The designer acknowledged this during the opening of Valentino: Master of Sewing, a triumphant retrospective exhibition that brings together more than 130 high fashion dresses created by his “home” over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unique Italian accent.
This exhibition is the final part of the story, the only character of which is "El Signore" Garavani, but it could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always felt charmed by the rare and distant world to know.
In the first hall of this exhibition, open until March 3, will abound with personal letters and photographs signed by the most noble aristocrats, from Princess Salima Aga Khan to Lord Snowden, including Marie Chantal, Princess of Greece, and Margaret, Princess of Great Britain.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from the modest porter from the city of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international “elite”.
Being in love with the royal court is not a bad thing.
“They don’t even put out their cigarette butts on your gorgeous carpet like some of the great pop stars do,” says Baroness Fiona Tissen-Bornemitz.
In the 60s and 70s we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is an incomparable host and welcomes guests with generosity and elegance.
“We all loved coming to his chalet in the Gstaad,” explains ex-wife Heini Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Evgenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
Despite this, he is a star.
Valeria Macza, representing Valentino
The Argentinian model Valeria Mazza recalls a charismatic modeler.
One day we went to dinner at his house, it was after the fashion show in the square of Spain in Rome, many years ago.
Among the twenty guests were Sharon Stone and John Kennedy, Jr.
Valentino's style was manifested in everything - in every detail of his apartment, in her outfit, in food, in music.
“Valentino made each of the guests feel important and loved,” recalls the “top model”, whose work with the model began in 1995 during the Haute Couture Week in Paris.
“He never goes out of fashion because his sketches are real works of art,” she concludes.
The Parade of Genealogy
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsessions, but of love with complete reciprocity.
He loves people with good upbringing and high titles, and they love him.

Nati Abascal and fashion designer, in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentine - as the first love, "it is impossible to forget."
I remember him perfectly.
These were trousers, shirt, vest and jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Nati Abascal, one of the designer’s muse.
“I prefer him to the rest for his femininity, for his great love for women, because he emphasizes our beauty,” added the former Duchess de Feria.
I really like the colors that he uses: they have a lot of light and they "approach" his face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion lawmaker Patricia Della Jovampaola d'Arenberg also can't forget the first time she dressed in Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed that I would have the age and the reason to wear one of his evening toilets...
Finally, that hour came at the end of the 90s.
I bought my first dress from Valentino to wear to a holiday in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edward de Lin.
It was a red dress, with a skirt with collars, a "corsage" in a fold and a cut without straps.
“It was a dream come true,” says the widow of Rodrigo d’Arenberga.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his passion is timeless,” explains the Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess d'Arenberg keeps her holiday dresses from the model with "maximum caution ... because the dress is not just a dress, it is also a set of memories accompanying it".
The "King of Fashion"
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is a wedding dress by Marie-Chantal Miller for her wedding to Pavlos from Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 “girls” (as the fashion designer calls his seams) to make this outfit out of ivory-colored silk inlaid with pearls, twelve kinds of different laces and a four-and-a-half-meter stripe.
According to journalist Susie Menkes, the greatest authority of the specialized press, the dress represents a milestone of high fashion of the late 20th century, "the return of customers from the upper world."
Overwhelmed for many years by the elite’s “lifestyle,” Valentine himself is now its best representative.
Knight of the Grand Cross (sign of distinction of the highest rank in Italy), Knight of Labor, Commander of the Order of Arts and Literacy, awarded the Order of the Legion of Honour, Garavani collected as many honors as any of the spouses of his clients.
“My attention has always been drawn to his subtlety, his calmness, his neat and impeccable appearance,” recalls Dr. Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a celebratory dinner at the Orse Museum.
He was sitting at the table with Countess Jacqueline de Ribe, my great friend.
"He was impeccable, there is no time for him."
If that's what the princess says...
The hardest profession in the world: miners from Kawah-Ijen
For four euros, Indonesian miners risk their lives and health by hauling 70 kilograms of sulfur to the top of the volcano on steep rocky paths
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
Among them is Anto Vijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living by mining sulfur in Kawah-Ijen volcano, located in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
Every day, Anto descends to the very bottom of the crater, where the sulphurous gas rising from the depths of the Earth freezes when in contact with the air.
He cuts off huge pieces of sulfur, the total weight of which can reach 70 kg, he puts them in two bamboo baskets, folds the baskets on his shoulders and carries them upstairs along a rugged stone road.
To the top of the volcano, whose height is 2,386 meters, is only 250 meters, however, it takes more than 40 minutes for the exhausted trucks to climb the tortoise step, with difficulty maintaining balance and carefully sensing the road, so as not to stumble and fall off the cliff.
They know that one wrong step can cost them their lives, as happened to one tourist from France who broke away from the Kawah-Ijen rocks a few years ago.
Kawah-Ijen miners earn 5 Eurocents for every kilogram of sulfur they extract
Being at the top, they make their way between the tourists who photograph them, as if they were circus monkeys and, tired of carrying heavy baskets, walk three kilometers to the weights that the mining company has placed a little higher, at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
We are talking about PT Kandy Ngrimbi, an enterprise that has been operating this volcano since 1960 and, better yet, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euros cents) for every kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) to petrochemical production, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used for making matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even for bleaching sugar.
“Since the norm is to carry 70 kilograms, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each walk,” explains Anto, who usually performs three daily transfers.
He spends three hours on each of them and at the end feels broken, but they allow him to accumulate 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) by the end of the day.
Although it seems a squalor for such an inhumane effort, it is three times more than he would earn in the field.
“The daily wage for miners is very high according to local standards, where the collection of coffee is paid 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) per day and the average monthly earnings is two million rupees (167 euros),” explains the trucker, who previously worked as a stonemason on the tourist island of Bali.
There his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the plot was not so heavy, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a town near the volcano, for a good reason, which in Indonesia is as crushing as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, and I took her to another place."
Anto has asthma, he breathes hard, constantly coughs, and his eyes tear because of toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto spent three years risking himself in Kawah-Ijen, whose sulfur had already begun to affect him despite the presence of masks and special glasses.
He has asthma, he breathes hard, constantly coughs, and his eyes tear because of the toxic gases that the volcano emits.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
“I’m going to work for another two years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished by life, this pleasant and intelligent young man could be a tour guide, waiter or porter in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mules.
It shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers, it gets up every day at two o’clock in the night, because the sulfur does not stop flowing at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends into the crater, illuminating himself with a small lantern attached to his helmet, which he bought for his own money.
About 400 carriers are dragging baskets with gray on their shoulders from the bottom of the volcano
Despite the high profits, the mining company has not mechanized the production of sulfur to save costs and does not provide any equipment to the carriers that work on their own account and with such deprivations.
In fact, they don’t even get a portion of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) photo shoot fee, which, along with an entrance ticket for 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), guards of this reserve charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its mules.
“This is a job for cattle, not people,” says Badrusin, a 42-year-old root-carrier who has spent three decades at Kawah-Ijen since leaving college.
Able to lift up to 110 kilograms, he says he will tolerate working “as much as he can” because he needs money to educate his three children aged 18 to 10.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although the sulfur burns the throat and burns the eyes, when the wind suddenly changes and catches the miners in the dense pillars of smoke coming out of the volcano, they are so hardy that no one complains of their severe diseases... more serious, obviously, than their usual problems with the elbows and thighs.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can now only lift 50 kilograms in his 53 years.
Every day he and his comrades carry 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks transport to the warehouse in Tamansari, overcoming a distance of 18 kilometers along a narrow path among the thickets.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano is my whole life,” Unainik says, opening his mouth wide, which lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30, also works as a sulfur transporter.
Time passes, but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation one of the most difficult occupations in the world: what human mules do with Kawah-Ijen.
Singapore Seeks Children to Save the Economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress, and housing and education prices for the lack of children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I'm a patriot's husband, you're my patriot's wife, let's do our civic duty and make a living!
It may seem incredible that these lines are part of a mint note ad, but despite this – or perhaps because of this – this video became a YouTube hit in Singapore earlier this year.
These phrases are part of a rap that uses local sayings like “Let’s put the bao (bulk) in the oven” to laugh at the birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising agency that made this video, BBH, cherishes the hope that with the help of advertising they will be able to draw attention to this problem in an entertaining way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to make people do “his national duty.”
This thing is exclusively for the Internet, so we needed to make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in the country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt that this is the topic we should touch on.
We knew that the government was trying to do a lot, for example, to launch ghosts with pheromones or organize parties of quick acquaintances (blitz-dates).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don’t we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, namely rap?
1.2 children
Anyone who doesn’t take it lightly is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
The state package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity and maternity leave, and provides tax breaks.
But all this has low efficiency.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leadership and its strict public control.
The birth rate in Singapore, according to its national population management, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was below 2 - what is known as the replacement rate - in 1976.
So why don’t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Min, director of the National Population Administration’s Spouse and Family Policy Department, said the reason for this was “improved education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“This has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, in addition to getting married and starting a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms contribute to the increase in the number of bachelors and the postponement of marriages and childbirth, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policy, which aims to dramatically increase immigration to counter population decline, is causing outrage among the local population.
There are websites in Singapore where there is a barely concealed xenophobia against many new immigrants, especially Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and unwilling to integrate.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s ruling party had the worst election result since independence last year.
After the election, there was an attempt to solve the problem, using quotas and higher taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the decline in fertility has some impact on the nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, medical expenses, and immigration policy, Singapore’s example is also starting to have some unexpected consequences.
The government is making efforts not to build so much small housing.
For example, this is beginning to affect the real estate sector.
The Urban Development Manual has now passed to controlling the number of small apartments known as “shoe boxes” that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments with an area of 46 square meters are very well sold.
However, there is an opinion that they can contribute to a sloppy lifestyle and deprive the incentives of developers who want to build a large family home.
But Lim Yu Sun, CEO of home-building firm EL Developers, says their “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger ones.
They are more popular, in the sense that such apartments are bought for a few days, even weeks, faster than larger apartments.
As a result, our income increases.
However, he acknowledges that the new rules provide clearer guidance for developers who have previously faced hurdles if they wanted to offer too many small apartments in the project.
Too much overexertion
Singapore is a city-state.
While these new rules may be a step towards increasing national fertility, after talking to Singaporeans who work in the financial district of the center, it seems they won’t have much of an effect.
“People are very stressed, housing is expensive, as is education, and because of this, many people put it off,” says the young manager.
Other people can have children.
“But it’s important for me to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women refer to their careers, stress, and housing and education prices as reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to encourage its citizens to have children, in terms of childbirth, the last word remains with Singaporeans.
Personal in the offline - personal in the online
Confidentiality.
According to the dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is a property of private or "the sphere of personal life, which they have the right to protect from any interference".
What is personal for a minor under the age of 16?
How does he apply this definition in his daily life and in social networks?
Does he understand the dangers of discussing situations on the Internet that he would certainly not have shared outside the Internet?
elPeri<0xC3><0xB3>dico interviewed five boys between the ages of 10 and 15, who were frequent users of the network.
In four cases, they associated the term with “something very personal” and “password and username” when they applied it to social media.
“My biggest secrets I wouldn’t upload to a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge, as he tries to explain the importance of personal on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"It's a very secret, my mom may know them, but not the whole world," he says.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures or pictures from games.
I also have fun with my friends.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that’s not mine, or someone who’s behaving stupidly,” he says.
The boy realizes that it is bad to publish indecent photos of naked people, crimes or to write offensive or angry comments.
Jorge assures that he knows 35 friends he has on FB, and nine of his followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother knows she has a password to one of the accounts.
I started Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they answer me, I just download them,” he adds.
“Social media is entertainment, I can talk to distant relatives or to my friends quickly,” he says.
Without thinking, he replies that he would never accept a request from a stranger.
I wouldn't count on someone recommending him to a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Jose is different.
This teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and the latter admits that he does not know 20 people added to his list of friends.
“It doesn’t scare me because we have something in common, music, for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one trusted him and did not ask for his home address or phone number.
“If I’m being pressured or demanded, I’ll just remove them from my account,” he admits.
Jose became a follower of Ask after reading the recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to the experience of what is now known as cybermobbing.
A friend of mine was blackmailed on social media.
He was threatened and robbed of money.
“He never knew who it was,” he said.
The victim, according to Jose, did not delete the account.
"Just turned on the privacy."
It then explains the sequence of steps to set up your account in a secure way.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or confusing situations.
Yeah, I'd do that if I didn't like the person or if I wanted to.
“Although I know it’s cybermobbing,” he confirms.
Key issues:
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a specialist in education and training, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet has emerged as a means to search for information, but with the advent of these sites, the rules of the game have changed,” she notes.
Porras points out that academician Mark Prensky, a master of pedagogy at Yale University and author of Digital Aboriginals and Immigrants, invented these terms to explain the phenomenon.
Digital aborigines are those, children and young people who were born in the age of technology.
“We’re digital immigrants who have to teach them while we’re still learning,” she says.
It explains that this topic is complex, “because we ask them to have a certain criterion of what can or cannot be distributed, published or spoken, at an age when maturity is lacking for it.”
“Also make them elective, while the most important thing for them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to show what privacy is for children and adolescents is to ask questions that make them think.
“To tell them not to do it is useless,” she adds.
Then Porras lists some options: Are there things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, so why are you doing it online?
Or would you like to have a photo of you posted like the one you posted about your friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you sign photos from parties, do you ask permission from other people to mark them?
And one more thing, does everyone need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to let them know that they should behave online the same way they do offline.
The rules are the same.
“Outside the Internet, people behave with respect, responsibility and other principles, as should be in social networks,” she says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university lecturer, a professor of primary education and an education consultant, explains the need for heads of families to read social media policies in good faith.
Understanding each of the points, they have good grounds for talking to children about the prerequisites of opening an account online.
“For example, age and what is allowed to be distributed or published,” he says.
According to Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>, the key question is to remind children of the lesson “do not talk to strangers”.
The UNASUR summit ends without the Lima Declaration being made public
The 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the announcement of the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the family of mandatory participants.
The EFE has repeatedly sought access to the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of UNASUR, but sources from the Office and the Presidential Administration have indicated on the main page that it will be transmitted after the closure, but then confirmed that at some point it will be published on the Peruvian Government’s website.
On questions about the text, they pointed out that the contents were set out by the President of Peru, Olianta Umalas, during brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information about the Summit was always limited.
During the day, only a video of the presidential assembly without sound was broadcast, in the press room, with the message "closed meeting, sound prohibited".
Few of the information circulating among the reporters was provided by the press-secretaries of some of the UNASUR governments present at the meeting, but not the Peruvian one.
The only document circulated during the day was a list of participating presidents, which caused discontent among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who asked for more information.
Subsequently, the administration of the President of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with a “final declaration” of the summit, but it is a statement by Umalas, not an official document that ended the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the III Summit of South American and Arab Countries (ASPA), and this time, despite the insistence of the press, the so-called Lima Declaration, which was previously announced, was also not distributed.
On the official ASPA website, you can check that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities have tried to ensure that transmission systems are provided for all journalists, but to limit the receipt of information as much as possible.
The summit also concluded with a joint decision by Chile and Peru to adopt the verdict of the Hague Court, which will settle the territorial dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Olianta Umalas, and Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met at a regional meeting and ratified that they would abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice, which begins on Monday in The Hague hearing statements of both sides, in the framework of the accusation that Lima has made against Santiago.
“We will abide by and enforce a decision that will clarify the differences that we are currently presenting in this international court,” Umala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile was, is, and will be a country that respects international law, peaceful settlement of disputes, pacts and international tribunals,” Piniera added, and welcomed Umalu’s handshake against the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the International Court of Justice came immediately after Colombia objected this week to the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> Pact, according to which it recognized compliance with the verdicts of that international court following a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered erroneous.
The summit was held in the absence of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rousseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chavez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, whose membership in UNASUR has been suspended since 2011 following the impeachment of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
The incoming president, Olyanta Umalas, was responsible for opening the talks in the morning and closing the summit, just after noon Lima time.
The head of state read the final document, in which he said that 16 agreements were adopted and 31 project directions were approved among South American countries, the amount of the planned investments amounted to 17 billion dollars.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of UNASUR will take “important steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are expanding the agreements on the place of residence”.
He said that actions are being taken to improve “cooperation in the fight against citizens’ insecurity and against organized transnational crime, actions to increase the availability of medicines, low-cost Internet access in all parts of South America and to take into account the risks of natural disasters in a comprehensive and effective way”.
As Europe is in crisis, “the economic unification (of Latin America) should not have a triumphant basis, but should serve to expand our production base and foresee a better future for our cities,” Umala added.
“We have decided to give the privilege to a group of 31 landmark projects that will improve the connectivity of South America’s spaces, especially in rural and border areas... uniting our countries and forming new economic schemes,” the Peruvian president said in a statement.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five relate to Peru, and are limited by the transverse axes on its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are aimed at greater communication with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also touched on the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve its re-accession to the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of well-being and peace, to be united, and to have good relations among its neighbours, was another theme highlighted at the summit.
In this sense, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting to participate in the regional meeting, that he hopes to meet with his colleague from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico City to hold negotiations in a respectful manner on the maritime dispute as a result of God's faithfulness.
"After tomorrow (Saturday), I may meet with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these paths, they are not mutually exclusive, including the pact with Nicaragua will require discussions with Nicaragua," he said.
“With President Ortega, I hope I can tell him that we will deal with this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico City, where they are scheduled to attend the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Also in the framework of the summit, the defense ministers of the bloc met in advance for the approval of the Action Plan for 2013, which aims to strengthen dialogue and unanimity on the issue of the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UNASUR, although the participation of the latter is suspended.
Peru has a temporary presidency in the regional bloc.
“South America must learn from Europe on the integration of citizenship” – Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is the goal in which "South America, in this case, yes, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) held in Lima, told Peruvian state television that the Europeans “killed each other during World War II” and in other clashes, “but now they are practically one homeland.”
He defended, in this context, the South American citizenship project, which was endorsed by the countries participating in UNASUR.
“It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case with members of the Andean community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to bring us back to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian president has also expressed support for the resumption of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San José Pact on human rights.
Those who read the lectures never take on any obligations, and we South Americans, on the contrary, sign everything.
“It is inexplicable that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and funded by the United States,” he said, hinting at Ecuador’s political asylum for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision, because with it he did not betray his principles, but respected his "deep values of democracy and human rights."
He added that at the time "there were certain suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and would not follow the process."
He also criticized Swedish justice for demanding to come to his territory for questioning regarding the alleged sexual offence, while "only Swedish law considers it possible to implement it through a videoconference that could be made from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa confirmed that there is a risk of Assange’s physical and mental health deteriorating.
“I haven’t spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador told me he had a small lung problem, nothing serious,” the Ecuadorian head of state said.
What is really there is a danger of his physical and mental health deteriorating due to confinement in a small space without the ability to do exercise in the air.
"It affects the health of any person," he added.
Correa pointed out that the solution to the asylum problem granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by providing a guarantee of inviolability that would allow him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and European judicial authorities, and stressed that there were solutions to the problems in London.
We do not negotiate on human rights, this word we do not use in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because Assange’s lawyer, Baltasar Garson, is conducting a number of trials in various European institutions,” he said.
He said: “If the UK provides a guarantee of inviolability tomorrow, it will end.”
And if Sweden, as it is perfectly permitted by its legislation and as it has done in other cases, interrogates Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or interrogates him via Skype, the problem will be exhausted tomorrow.
Correa took the opportunity to express himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stressed that he does not tolerate “mediation, dishonesty and lies that distort freedom of expression.”
“The main enemies of freedom of the press are not corrupt political villains, but bad journalists who support money, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In this respect, he was pleased that neither these journalists, “bankers nor bourgeois hegemons, dominate Ecuador,” and added that, being re-elected, “will deepen the revolution to continue development in the right direction.”
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto in UNASUR at least until the next election, arguing that the organization "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and support for coups under the guise of legality" because "in reality it has destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president also considered “completely justified” the desire of his Colombian counterpart Juan Manuel Santos to now negotiate with Nicaragua on the maritime borders between the two countries after the decision of the International Court of Justice of the Hague, which was in favor of Nicaraguan maritime sovereignty.
This decision is not being followed at the moment.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the desire to go together.
You have to work them together to overcome them and keep moving forward.
He also expressed hope for a good conclusion to the maritime border dispute between Peru and Chile, and said that “it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if the two countries commit themselves to a decision, however difficult it may be.”
Regarding the opportunity to stand as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to run for the third consecutive term, he said he considered this opportunity "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite difficult."
Correa assured that if he loses the election in February 2013, he will leave public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in unfair situations such as Ecuador, socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement felt that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to acknowledge this responsibility,” he said.
If I win, that would be my last term as president, and then we're out of public life.
If we lose, the same thing.
“This is a decision,” he confirmed.
Correa also mentioned a new course of treatment for Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke to Venezuelan Vice President Nicolas Maduro, who told me that he had gone for treatment, which was already scheduled, routine, and that he was expected to miss the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean that President Chavez’s health is deteriorating,” he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state took part today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), which ended with calls for greater regional integration to maintain progress, equality and security.
AIDS mortality today is the result of late diagnosis.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was announced that his AIDS analysis had given a positive result.
"I feel as if I have been deafened," he recalls the difficult, despite all the beat of the doctor, a moment.
The young man hid it from his family.
Having decided to cope with the disease on his own, he wanted to learn about it as much as possible. And his efforts were justified - he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
Fabrizio is one of the "oldest" HIV patients of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he got into 1994 after overcoming many obstacles.
He has been living with the diagnosis of "human immunodeficiency virus" (HIV) for 22 years. In the early 90s, it would be hard to believe - too little then there were options for treatment, too little knew about the disease, too biased treated patients.
So, even the director of the clinic of the Mexican Institute of Social Protection did not want to say goodbye to him, "because he had a stroke."
In other words, having AIDS at that time was a sentence.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do it without deteriorating the quality of life.
However, not knowing about their disease, many people still come when the virus has already damaged, "exhausted" their immune system and they suffer from opportunistic infections.
31 years after the emergence of AIDS in the world, at least after the first reported cases, "the great achievement so far is that the survival of a patient who starts treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population is exactly the same," - said the head of the HIV department HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, in a scientific statement.
Andrade Villanueva, an HIV/AIDS expert, explained that since 2008 scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a sentence, but the duration and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system available to patients at the beginning of the diagnosis, with a better expected life expectancy.
To put it simply, the above means that anyone diagnosed with HIV at the age of 25 years, according to these terms, “by maintaining control, will be able to live without problems for up to 75 years,” he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Although mortality has declined significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the emergence of AIDS, 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died.
In Halisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have already been recorded by May of this year; however, it is claimed that there has been widespread access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
- Why are there still fatal outcomes?
Personally, I don't think there's a problem with access to treatment.
That's the way I see it, that's the way things are in our hospital.
At least for the last 12 years we have not had a shortage of medications, the problem is that patients come very late because they do not know about their infected state, that is, in the late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients come when they already have some opportunistic infection; what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make a diagnosis at an earlier stage, and therefore it is necessary to provide samples for detection on a mass scale, for all people.”
In its proposal, experts and officials of the State Council for the Prevention of AIDS in Chalico (COESIDA) agree that the patient is the same, as well as the patients themselves, like Fabrizio, who applied for a check-up in a private laboratory, motivated only by what his friend did and, despite his young age, he was already at the same age.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they’re going to die and don’t want to know anything.
"I'll die anyway, I'd better hope three times a week," they say. But not in my case.
There are positive changes, I eat well, do exercises, take medication.
To this day, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
“I work, I have a lot of work, I travel, I lead an active sex life, but with mutual responsibility, I take care of myself and another person,” said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his personal life with MILENIO JALISCO, to promote his statement of those who now struggle with the world.
Let them check if there was a risk of infection, let them know as soon as possible if they are HIV positive, so much the better, and if they already have a diagnosis, let them know that they can live like any other person, being responsible.
This report summarizes the theme of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There is a great gap between health care programs and ordinary citizens, says Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has dealt with the problem of HIV.
And the biggest one is prevention.
In places dedicated to this task, "in fact, the spread of condoms has increased, we were given one or two before, now we are given packages of a hundred, and this is very good, but it turns out that there are those who still do not have access to the condom," he said.
Teenagers are among the most vulnerable to new infections.
"Why are they for you?" is a popular question, with scolding and condemnation from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health workers who do not want to hear teenagers, the propagandist assured.
I propose changing this inefficient distribution; so that condoms are not just behind the counters and that hundreds of them are in vending machines in public toilets in places that young people often visit.
This is not a promotion of disunity.
It is not about paying for a beer and a motel, Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez replied when asked if it was possible to distribute condoms under his leadership.
“It’s not sexuality, it’s best to make condoms available to those who are already practicing sexual activity,” he said.
Key Data in Halisko
There were 13,435 total cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is ranked 4th in the national ranking for new and total cases of AIDS and 13th for HIV.
92% of infections are in the genital tract, 6% in the blood, and 2% in the perinatal tract.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as for one registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know about it.
Taking into account the ratification by the United States Court of Appeals of a decision that annuls the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt achieved through competitive production in Mexico, the scenario sets a one-year precedent for any national company with branches in a neighboring country that has problems with payment.
It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of firms, which are allowed by Mexican laws, are not valid in the country of stripes and stars, in contradiction to international agreements.
In practical terms, the approval of a June 15 ruling by Justice Harlin Hale in the Texas Northern District Bankruptcy Court leaves defenseless Mexican firms in the face of the possibility of arresting their property on the other side of the Rio Grande.
However, the ruling opens the door to Mexico’s leading glassmaker for appeal to the United States Supreme Court, proving three inconsistencies.
As an introduction, while the judge of the case notes that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, located in New Orleans, says that the main proceedings relate to the competitive proceedings under consideration in Mexico.
The first paragraph implies the cancellation of international judicial cooperation in cases of insolvency of enterprises of transnational profile.
In fact, for this purpose, the United Nations Model Law on the Unification of International Trade Law was created, defining the American Institute of Law as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the inter-company vote, the debts recognised in the critical mass of competitive production that Vitro’s subsidiaries had before their parent company would not have been reached by the majority necessary for the approval of the restructuring.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first time this scheme was adopted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agrimex and Comercial Mexicana, whose inter-company debts were guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Competitive Manufacturing.
It is also true that by subtracting the votes of branches, in one way or another, Vitro creditors, who fought against it in the courts of the United States, namely funds of “poultry” such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not reach the majority.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
The data of the Court of Appeal is omitted.
On the other hand, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation that it has faced since 2008, affected by the serious economic crisis that hit the United States, striking the country.
So far, the firm of the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family will appeal the decision to the Court of Appeal itself, so that the vote reaches its plenum, that is, five judges, because only three voted.
In the event of a failure, an application will be made for a certificate that will require a review by the Supreme Court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
Worst of all, the court rejected a document sent by the Mexican government in the role of amicus curiae ("the second court"), which describes the process followed by Vitro under the Competition Act, signaling that it exempts itself from compliance with the agreements signed by both countries to bind the U.S. 15th Bank to the Act.
In addition, it is noted that the country has complied with the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules established for cases of interstate insolvency, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Carambola from two sides: they beat in Vitro and beat in the country.
Overall balance
Taking into account several months of complaints placed on the table by the Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n trade unions against the former owner of the company, Gaston Ascarrag Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management, the Trade Union Association of Pilots of aviators has already discovered the bottlenecks.
The court, headed by Carlos Diaz Chavez Morino, has just filed a criminal case against the National Commission on Banks and Securities, which is accused of obstructing justice.
According to this, the supervisory body systematically refused to provide reports to the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Republic regarding the operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract 198 million pesos from the trust fund F/589 of the bank IXE, on behalf of Mexicana Airlines.
Resources would be directed to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Management Company.
As you know, Ascarraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Surrounded by Dragon Mart
A group of local and foreign ecologists, scientists, businessmen and members of the general civil society, gathered at a forum at the Caribbean University, and endorsed the creation of a broad front to counter the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a giant sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean country of products of an isolated country, with a residential area nearby for employees of 150 companies.
Earlier, Canacintra managed to unite the governors of the southeastern zone to confront the monumental forces that have leveled some of the protected areas with the ground and pose serious threats against the industry.
The Death of ACTA
With regard to the government’s rejection of the Senate’s request to explain under what conditions and circumstances the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as the abbreviation in the English ACTA, according to the Mexican Industrial Property Institute, the case has already been archived.
As you know, the action was carried out despite the fact that the Senate itself disqualified the possibility of treating it as violating freedom of expression in social networks.
Homex in the long term
In an effort to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term, home developer Homex is placing 500 million pesos of Exchange certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical, with an offer to pay interest every 28 days.
Competival comes to light
Formed by NYCE, e-Quality and Kernet, leaders in information technology, a consortium with the trade name Competival has just emerged, its goal will be the software cluster services market in Central and South America.
Investments in this area exceed $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hettin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Busy basketball traveler Hector "Hetyn" Reyes has been associated with the sport for more than 60 years and, thanks to him, has traveled the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico remember as many basketball stories as Hector "Hettin" Reyes.
And after all, before the brain hemorrhage pinned him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in sports for more than 60 years, as a player of small categories, a player of the Supreme Basketball League, an authorized and head of BSN with Cowboys Bayamone and President Feather.
“I’ve played a lot of basketball roles throughout my life, including a few at the same time as when I was president of BSN, CEO of the National Team and president of the federation in the 90s,” Reyes recalls during Primera Hora’s visit to his home in Bayamo, where he lives with Isabelle, his fiance.
“Basketball was my life.
Reyes doesn't exaggerate by making this claim.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photographs and commemorative things collected for his long journey, testify to this.
Bayamo in the heart
With the greatest emotions, he keeps those who remember his way through the Cowboys, from the mid-50s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old as a co-agent or contract agent.
“These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I had the opportunity to be part of the eight Cowboys championships since 1967, as an agent, co-agent or manager.
There have been many years of joy, including five championships held from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's BSN debut.
From that moment on, “Cuco” Ortiz, who was a great administrator, became the leader,” said Reyes.
I remember Jean Bartow, who was on his way here and was at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, telling me, "I have a very strong player for you, a 6'7".
"Want to?"
And that was the beginning of Minsi, one of the best players Puerto Rico had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gauss, who gained citizenship and became one of our best bombers.
I remember saying that if Mincy had brought the championship to Bayamo, Gauss would have helped to win another one.
I enjoyed the Cowboys championship with Gauss, but already at a distance, because by 1988 he was already the head of the federation.
At the time, I preferred to enjoy his achievements and the achievements of Minsi in the national team.
I remember the first time we won at the U.S. Olympic Qualifiers in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we got fourth place and it was supposed to be bronze, if not for the Canadian judge who made us replay the final game, Reyes said.
That team from the 1990 World Cup is the best team you've ever seen?
She is among the best, as well as the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympic Games.
But my favorite was that of the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, when we won the gold and beat the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one that won bronze at the World Cup.
In that team not only played again Minsi, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Fico Lopez and 'Piculin' (Ortisa), but also young (Havier) 'Tonito' Colon and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francis and Edgar) and Mario 'Kihota' Morales, who did not play in the 90s.
The team, which was perhaps not the best in terms of personnel, but brought us a gold medal and great joy, was the team of the 1995 Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Neuquen, Argentina.
With role-players like Canito Nieves, Pablo Alicéa and young Rolando Hurruitner in exchange for players temporarily suspended for disorder in the Pan American Championship Mar del Plata, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Without a doubt, it was Piculin Ortis.
His performance in international tournaments is impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico dominated at this level like Piculin did.
And that’s without taking into account his career in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
It's a very complicated question.
We had a very good young man, including Julio Toro, Flora Melendes, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
From a young age, I really like Leo Arilla's work.
What do you consider your main achievement in the federation?
Participation in the most glorious era of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and that in the early 90s in BSN was up to 17 teams in the season.
What do you have left to do?
There were things that I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of smaller categories.
For example, let the boys from Ponce play only in their area and only against teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Now the guys are traveling and playing too much, and it's superfluous.
At the very least, I see the fruits of mandatory certification and coursework for managers, officials and judges.
It gives me pleasure.
What are you doing now?
Mostly I listen to music, watch music videos of my era on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball matches.
And, of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Icabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931 in Fort Worth, Texas, became world famous for his starring role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he embodied an unprincipled businessman, evil and manipulative.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon J.R. Ewing in the television series Dallas became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in the new season of Dallas, died Friday night of complications from cancer, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., a Dallas production studio.
“Larry has returned to his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing again the iconic role he liked most,” his family said.
Larry’s family and closest friends were with him in Dallas at the Thanksgiving Fair.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original series and in the sequel, was standing next to Hagman when he died in Dallas Hospital, her rep Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, cheerful, kind and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived a full life," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and he admitted to drinking for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Long before "Dallas", Hagman gained prominence on television due to his role as a decent type in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", which aired on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life changes when he meets an attractive gin girl played by Barbara Eden and begins to live with her under one roof.
He was also the main character of two comedies that rarely appeared on the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included well-received roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto, and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the delightfully disgusting J.R. that brought Hagman to the pinnacle of fame.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its entourage aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan “Who Shot J.R.?”, designed to create a buzz around the episode, full of emotions, in which the character of Hagman is almost killed, has spawned international discussions and millions of dollars, which were risked in bookmakers counters.
It also helped to attract a record-breaking audience to the series at the time.
When the answer was given in the November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers watched it and turned Dallas into the second most-watched entertainment program in history, after the 1983 MASH finale, which drew 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law, Christine (played by Mary Crosby), who shot him.
J.R. stopped her and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she didn’t get out of town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman played Ewing as an insatiable corrupter with a charismatic smile: a dishonest businessman and an unfaithful husband who wanted his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), put on treatment.
“I know what should be on J.R.’s grave plate,” Hagman said in 1988.
It must be said, "Here rests an honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
It's the only deal he's lost.
Victoria Princepal, also the heroine of the original series, remembered on Friday Hagman as someone "huge, both on and off screen".
It is unforgettable and indispensable for millions of fans around the world, and in the hearts of each and every one of us who has been fortunate to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new release of “Dallas” were shown a few months ago with great success on TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes of the second season has already been completed and the sixth was in production, the channel said.
Warner or TNT have yet to make a statement about what will happen to the series after Hagman's departure.
A native of Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who excelled in such classic works as South Pacific and Peter Pan.
Martin was a teenager when she gave birth to him in 1931 during his marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his hand at the New York theater scene in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956.
While there, he met the young Swedish artist Mai Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California town of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he called his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t include anything that I thought would hurt anyone or affect them in any way,” he told Prensa Asociada at the time.
After a liver transplant, he began to promote organ donation and worked as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients who were afraid.
“I give them advice, I give them courage, I meet them when they go into surgery, and after,” he said in 1996.
I’m trying to offer some comfort, like, “don’t be afraid, it’ll be a little uncomfortable in a short time, but you’ll be fine.”
He also actively opposed smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Begins a course that explores the "End of the World"
Every week, students explore apocalyptic phenomena such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charme decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible catch: the end of the Mayan calendar’s “long countdown,” December 21, which many people seized as proof that the end of the world was coming.
But Sharma had no idea what to expect in the next couple of months: the catastrophic Sandy hurricane, the financial crisis that some call the “longarmageddon,” and the growing conflict that will drag Israel into, a place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize it was going to be the most apocalyptic semester of all,” Charme told students at Rutgers University in New Jersey this week.
If you analyze what is happening in the world right now, as if we only have 30 days left, it was a really good period.
And remember, bad is good for those who have an apocalyptic mindset.
And he’s not the only professor to offer courses on “the end of the world” this semester, theoretically the last in history.
At Temple University, Assistant Professor Barry Walker teaches a course on “Media, Culture, and the End of the World.”
Every week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global warming.
“We’re analyzing why these ideas spread over time,” he said, and the way hypothetical scenarios that trigger certain human actions are offered.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, war could break out.
This month, students analyzed films on apocalyptic themes and studied how they relate to real-life examples.
“I’ve tried to tell students that maybe it’s probably plausible and impossible,” Walker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amar Solari, an adjunct professor of art history and anthropology, teamed up to read a course called simply “The End of the World.”
“We’re not adding ‘2012’ to always be able to read the course again in case the end of the world doesn’t come,” Restall said.
Despite the "inevitable destruction", students must study, prepare projects and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, which leaves students with no choice but to work “until the very night that the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
“The places finished in two hours,” Restall said of his course for students with a high average score, which was signed up by 35 students.
We received e-mails for many weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
Students, in turn, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
“I like to watch what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridget Robinson, a 23-year-old student at the Department of Religion and Sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
And the apocalyptic image of thought, secular or religious, is only a matter of consolation or its absence.
Will Vequez, a 25-year-old student at the Department of Psychology and Nursing, said he watched all the apocalyptic movies.
“I’ve never heard of a course that would teach this,” he noted.
I like him.
But none of the students surveyed — not to mention the professor — said they believed in the date of the end of the world on December 21.
