I am sick.
What is the French language spoken in Canada?
Do you want to go to the French class?
I'm going to find him.
Put a stamp on the bag and put it in the job.
Where's that after that?
I've listened to a lot of good music.
Thala.
I'm very busy with my work.
He stopped at Thomas's house.
"Did you love Mary?"
Your life in the world!
Happy birthday to you!
I remember where I was taken.
I didn't invite you.
I made my feet.
Haven't been in town for a long time?
What's best for you?
It's the day of life.
It's a combination of the two of us.
Thank you very much!
The fish was squirming in the water.
I'm trying to eat a better meal.
Thomas didn't want to leave.
I'm drinking the cup.
I'm amazed at what's going on.
You're caught!
Do you take that?
What's best for you?
This is a letter to the hon.
I'm all peace.
The letter made him angry.
—Should I do that? —No, I shouldn’t.
I'm from Kyoto.
Where would I go? I won't tell you!
I'm eating booze.
Thomas asked me, "Didn't you see Mary's Alice?"
What is the difference between Calum and Mary?
I hope your family is well, my friend.
He went through a lot.
Why don't you listen?
This house was all over the lake.
I've seen a lot of Thomas.
Do you know where New York is?
You've been there?
I made him angry.
Hello, all of you.
- Murt!
Can I ask how old you are?
There's a small hole in that hole.
It will come soon.
Who's doing this?
I have a cat and a dog. The cat is black and the dog is white.
It's all in this room, isn't it?
I'm pretty sure he's learning French.
Are you a student?
I'm the one who's in charge.
Do you want to live in the heart of love?
I'm waiting for the train.
I am sick.
For forty years and eleven, Thomas and Mary separated from each other.
I remember a lot of things.
That's how it's ever been.
Do you have a phone number?
I'm angry with my body.
I'm at peace with it!
I would be happy to help you.
It was a good night and a good night.
We arrived at the station at six o'clock.
That's what makes him angry.
They were the ones who had the audacity.
I don't know where what happened.
Are you looking for a very nice person?
What do you think?
There is no voice to say.
Mary and James are talking to each other.
Tammy doesn't have to leave.
I'm going to go to dinner at half past seven in the evening.
He didn't leave Asheville.
"Was there a dog under the table?" "There was."
Say the day.

A clean-up with Thomas

This is Thomas' house.
He is now on the path of truth.

There's a good amount of fire on this one.

He's Irish, he's Irish.
Here's the students.
I hope you love her.

Where's the bread?
That's when I bought a car at the store.
There's a good peace there.
Thomas is working.
I was a lover of kindness.
It's a woman inside.
Thomas has children.
"Your mother's in?
Where's your peace of mind?
I'm going to make him angry.
- Murt!
The book is near.
There are no legs.
There are the best people in the world.
Hold on to you!
You're going to leave now.
"What did you give her for two years?" he asked.
I remember him well.
How long have you been working on this?
The young people are singing.
It's the ad for me.
I'm aware of these people.
You gave me a drink.
Aren't you going to the house?
Eat your own food.
He has two brothers, one of whom lives in Osaka and the other in Kobe.
It's from England.
You need a little bit.
The fire is hot.

You don't need you.

Hold on to two.

Welcome to the country.

It's a long fall.
He is right.
I am free.

What do you think?
Where's the corner?
Thomas has a job.
I need a new bike.

Thomas has a lot to say.
He's been quick on the pitch?
I'm glad to hear that you are a prophet.
Juliana told me that you are from S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
That's how it's ever been.
—Would you like to marry Mary? —Yes.
"Do you want to go to Boston?" "Don't."
God created me.
Will you be there?
What's the price?
It's not how she was born.
Look at where I'm at today!
There is no life without respect.
It's a good math!
It doesn't even stop at a taxi.
"Do you drink wine?" he asked.
Do you want to get married to Mary?
He says she's his mother.
He was listening to music.
There was a lot of new stuff in the house.
Do you listen to music?
I hope you love him.
It's like Mary's.
Are you going to be a thug?
It's a great word.
Thomas has a lot of talent.

I'm going to have this TV show, at least.
It's a good new year!
It's better than losing.
What did you do with my book?
A clean-up with Thomas
I'm talking about music.
He was so poor that he couldn't buy bread.
Do you have a phone number?
There is no sound in Thomas's brother.
You didn't have peace.
I don't think I've learned the language that everyone has.
You're better than the law.
It's going to end!
It's not a bad thing to get a cat.
How are you?
Thomas promised that he would be back soon.
Thomas has two children.
Did you get a lot of what?
There was no sign of Thomas.
I only have two or three drinks.
Go to Thomas' house.
It's a bit of a purchase.
It's a small house.
You have a sad face.

His glory will not be lost, but the glory and majesty of God will be revealed.
Have a good day.

My heart goes out to the big sheep.

Do you want to get in touch?
I would be happy to help you.

Are you 10 years old?
The house is big.
There is a ban on smoking in homes in California.
I'm reading a book on the subject.
His speech was well-deserved in the audience.
I didn't invite you.
I'm surprised who they are.
There's a place for Thomas.
Keep the minions.
I would like you to send my name to the database for the course.
Look at him again.
That was the news.
It's like with me.
They are very much afraid of them.
Who are you?
Why are you alone?
I'm not rich, I'm not rich.
I've got enough.
I was at peace.
I need a stamp.
—Do you know Thomas? —I don’t know.
What Are You Doing?
Thomas asked me, "Have you seen Mary's Alice in Wonderland?"
There was no one like Thomas.
My brother is in a very good position in Australia.
I'm with you now.

I'm surprised who found it.
Have you ever seen a sledgehammer?
I don't have to go, but you do.
Thomas was expecting to marry Mary, but he did not want to marry her and did not want to marry her.

I don't think it's working.

I'm doing my homework.
This is a joy.

Say good-bye!
Thomas won't be able to write a good French.
It's a good time on the pitch.
Depending on what you think about yourself and what you think about yourself.
I don't want to go to school.
Did you see my face?
How old is it?
I'm going to give it to Mary.
The new house is in the early stages.
The cat is near.
The wife is right.

Aren't they going to the city?
We've had to re-paint the blade to add a new color.

I don't have French.
Thomas has been studying French for three years now.
What's your name?
"You have a lot of French." "I'm not so fond of you."
Don't you see Thomas?
I'm listening to this song.
He'll be back three times.
You were at peace.
My son is working in a very busy environment.
It's been a long day, I'll say it today.
Where are we going to go tonight?
The boat was under water.
He was a man who was very good at what he did.

Did you have a lot in the house?
Look at that house.
It's in a very dry
Look at him again.
I don't remember.
And Mary!

I've really been trying to figure it out in October.
A long hand is allowed to rest.

I'm sad.
I made him angry.
Have you read this yet?
"What's the matter?" he asked, "there's more to it than that."
There is no water there.
What are you going to do with Alba?
Welcome to.
That's a little bit of me!
I'm very squeamish.
It's the day of the Sabbath.
He's the man, if you will.
I'm fine, I'll catch you.
They're talking to each other.
Thomas told me in French that he had seen Mary's Alice in good health.
I'll see you again.
There was peace in the world.
It's the end of Sept.
Thomas wouldn't be happy with it.
I think it was a good one, really!
Have you ever seen a cane?
Let's get the bus out of town.
Do you want to work in the office in the morning?
I'm drinking.
Where's Thomas's house?
It's my curse!
This is a squishy!
If it doesn't, cook?
It's more of a world.
The water is there.
I'm so glad to hear that you're looking forward to your stay in Alabama.
Does anyone know what's going on?
What do you want to drink?
Thomas said to me in French, "Alice saw Mary's beautiful face."
Hello. Hello.
It's the middle of the day.
Tim is hoping it will be.
I'm going to try to make a beeline.
Thank you very much!

"I know Thomas.
They have a lot of students.
It's all very soon.
It's all very well today.
He was an Irishman.
I remember that man.
I don't drink at home.
I am working on this.
I'd rather be traveling alone. . . .

I'm hoping to come.
I'm sure you have good friends.
I've been listening to a lot of great music.
I'm sad.

I'm not going to go there, hon.
My father is angry with me.
I've been listening to a lot of great music.
This house is all over the lake.
He's been very busy today.
There are a lot of lions in Africa.
Do you have a lot of nerve?
Thomas asks me, "Where did Mary's Alice see the good-for-nothing?"
Are you going to be out on a day off?
Thomas asks me, "Why did Alice see Mary's body in the first place?"
I hope they will come.
I only have a little bit of French.
Where would I go? I won't tell you!
My heart goes out to Thomas!
I wasn't working very well.
Why isn't there any French in this country?
You're angry?
There's a grumpy look in the air.
Why do people go to the house?
I'm just a little bit of a prophet.
We've got a bad man.
It's going to be the gallows.
He won't need it.
I'm glad to see you, Thomas.
I'll do something.
Thomas won't see it.
It's a beautiful day.
He teaches us the French language.
I hope you're right.

We don't have long hairs.
The man ate the bread.
Judas was better off with my hand.

You've been on your way to St. Thomas for the summer.
You shouldn't go out.
Hello, how are you, my friend?
I am not a criminal.
I don't like big cities.
I'm going to be squeamish.
Thomas will give it to us.
The man is tall.
Thomas has a son and a daughter.
It's a good free.
Betty killed him.
Tom took them.
My family is fine with you.
This was more than Thomas had expected.
I'm the black man.
It's today's day.
How old are you?
She made the same mistake again.
It's like a cloud on the horizon.
Who's going to lose that?
Do you want to work in the office in the morning?
I was an islander at the time.
You've got to go down, I've got to go down, I've got to go down.
Who's doing this?
It was great. I went to Kyoto.
He stopped at Thomas's house.
For the past three years, I've had a blast.
We need to stand up to the injustice.

I'm from Siakoku.
My sister can't talk to you today.
I bought a car in a very good location.

I know I don't know.
It's a good new year!

It's only a matter of time before the whole thing goes to work.
They're talking to each other.
"What did you get?" "I got two prophetic books."
There's a man at the door who wants to talk to you.
I hope it will be good.
He's not right.
What's best for you?
His son is now in college.
They're going to be working very hard in the future.
Tell me the name of the 9th month.
Tell me what you're doing in the area.
This is my bike.
I know I don't know.
Didn't you know he'd been gone for two years?
Thomas has two sisters and three daughters.
Don't sleep hard.
It's a cold day.
I have to go to London in the summer.
He's kind of like his father.
"Did you see the movie last night?" or "No."
I'm in this house.
You are the love of my life.
We're all students, we're all students.
I love the snow.
My son is like my father.
One day, she went crazy in the middle of the night.
I want to be young.
That's yours.
They were kind to each other.
"Are you going to go down the wrong path?" he asked.
That's better good.
She's drinking red wine.
I'm leaning.
Thomas made his way.
Welcome to the country.
How old is it?
It's a small word.
Oh my god, stay in the saddle!
Why can't you tell God what you're doing?
That's a good Maddie!
She's the girl of the car.
It's cold.
I have only a little prophecy.
There is no brother's voice.
They're eating their food.
"Didn't you see what we saw last night?" he asked.
They're talking.
I only want one.
There are five in the small town.
Thomas tells me, "I didn't see Mary's Alice at all."
I want to get married, but I don't want to get married.
The sun was shining in the morning, but it was very cold.
You've been there?
It's an all-rounder Heather.
I am sick.
I didn't believe my ears.
I need to cooperate with you.
The girl is in the window because the sun is very bright today.
There were only five of them?
Hold on to you!
He was working on the front porch.
My brother is eating bread.
There's a hole in Thomas.
She sent me a letter.
How's the peace?
I wouldn't be happy with that.
I've had a lot of pain in my neck.
It's a day of mourning in England.
The sun was shining with the blackness of the sky.
Tell us where you're coming from.
How's the peace?
The ground was wet with water.
I was a peacemaker.
The weather wasn't as good today as it was yesterday.
Thomas is going up the stairs.
The whole thing is thick.
I hope you love him.
We have a small house.
Close that door.
I'm reading a book.
Didn't you know he'd been gone for two years?
I have two cats.
—Should I do that? —No, I shouldn’t.
We are working very hard in the field today.
I know that you know that I know.
Tarot, it's a good one.
I'm not going with you.
My sister's name is.
Give me the paper, if you will.
I'm eating this.
Thomas has a lot of talent.
Do you want to read Tatoeba?
He's a good free man.
I was able to get a kick out of that.
I hope you have love for her.
Look at the house.
I'm very squeamish.
Let's see if they have a French accent.
—Do you know Thomas? —I don’t know.
Understood?
A good word will come to you.
I was on my way to town.
He is now on the path of truth.
He's got a beard?
I don't understand it.
Two hundred and forty-two not a man, and one hundred and forty-three not for a disciple.
I'm not singing.
Three who come without asking, love, hate and fear.
He's been gone for two years.
What good will it be for a man if he gains the whole world, yet forfeits his soul?
He did the work without any problems.
Did you see my face?
"What's wrong with you?" he asked.
There is a lot of water because the water is in the water.
There is a lot of work to be done.
Wealth, wealth, and debt will be collected, and debt will be collected.
This is my house.
I work in a bank.
He was surprised by Eames.
What was it that they were doing so badly?
I think there's a man there.
There's no one inside who knows.
You will receive a copy of the book if you go to the library.
It's Friday today. I'm buying fish.
What did you do with your love?
There is no need to learn French.
Do the right thing against the wrong.
I don't think it's French.
It is dark.
You need him.
Do you think there's a whole bunch of bad stuff?
He met Mary in 1972.
It was the day of the tiara.
There are others in the sea.
Depending on what you think about yourself and what you think about yourself.
I'm sad, but I have to go home very soon.
I will go to the city in a moment. Would a man like to come with me?
Two months later, Thomas began to study the French language.
I promised to come back soon.
I'm glad to see you, Thomas.
I'm sure she'll be singing in church tomorrow.
We went there when we were in the French countryside.
This is Thomas' house.
The man, with his tail, was so slow on the hill.
I'm very much in Hong Kong.
That's the truth I have.
"Why are you angry?
Do you want the work done for you?
I hope you're the one.
It was a good day there.
He's coming with me.
I'll be longing.
Why don't you listen to me?
What's your name?
It's been three years and three years since I left the country.
You gave him a drink.
I've heard a lot of loud noises.
I'm looking for a drink.
I am free.
Isn't there new bread in the pan?
Who are you going to be with?
I don't love him and I love him.
There's a house across the street.
You'll have a good mouth!
You're very strong, aren't you?
Thomas has a son and two daughters.
He didn't make it.
That's quite good.
I remember him well.
Good night.
Thomas is going down the stairs.
I hope there will be a sequel.
I can read it.
Thomas was with me all day long.
It's the pride of honor.
I can't see it.
"Did you fall in love with Mary?"
Tell me the name of the 9th month.
Today is the day of reckoning, and today is the day of reckoning.
Taro died two years ago.
I want to get married, but I don't want to get married.
How's the peace?
Aren't you happy?
Is the quality of the milk better than that?
