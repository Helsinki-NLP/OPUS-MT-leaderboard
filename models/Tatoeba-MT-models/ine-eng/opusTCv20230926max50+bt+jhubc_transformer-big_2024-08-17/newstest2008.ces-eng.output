Inflation in Europe has jumped because of food
The accelerating inflation measured in the euro area is mainly due to the constant rise in food prices.
November’s price growth in 13 eurozone countries was higher than expected, with annual inflation at 3.1 percent after 2.6 percent in October, the Union’s statistical office said.
The official forecast was only 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
In contrast to the US, UK and Canadian banks, the European Central Bank (ECB) has not lowered the basic interest rate, with the fact that a reduction along with rising raw material prices and falling unemployment would lead to an inflationary spiral.
The ECB would like to keep the inflation rate below 2%, but close to it.
According to one of the analysts, the ECB is in an absurd situation: it has to "derail" inflation so that it does not have to do anything about it later.
In Germany, November inflation stood at 3.3 percent, a 15-year record; in Spain, it rose from 3.6 percent to 4.1 percent.
Inflation in the euro area has skyrocketed due to sharply rising food and energy prices.
The futures price of wheat rose by 88 percent, and the soy price reached its highest level since 1973.
Similarly, in 2007 it was necessary to pay significantly more for edible oil and dairy products.
The price of oil in world markets this year rose by 52 percent and last month, one barrel of black gold was already worth nearly $100.
According to the ECB, inflation will jump from 2.1 per cent in 2008 to 2.5 per cent this year, but will already fall to 1.9 per cent in 2009.
According to analysts, the level of 12-month inflation in the next 3-4 months will continue to be approximately 3 percent, but its average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, they expect the ECB to cut interest rates twice in 2008.
Gallup sees a government crisis
The circle of supporters of the Fidesz movement, after a prolonged stagnation at the beginning of December, has grown significantly, and so now has the largest camp since 2002, while in the case of the socialists the Gallup Institute has never targeted such a low - 13 percent support.
In the case of certain party voters, the difference - due to the greater determination of opposition voters - would represent more than two-thirds (71%) of the support versus five percent of the support of the MFA.
According to the survey, MDF and SZDSZ are below the threshold for entry into parliament: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among certain party voters, supporters of both camps are one percent more.
The public's view of the economy has also deteriorated in light of the previous minimum - the ratio of those who consider the country's economic situation to be very bad has never been so high - 41 percent, while according to another 46 percent the situation is quite bad.
Families are now again more pessimistic about the change in their material situation after spring and summer promising prospects.
As for next year, the majority of the population expects further deterioration and only a tenth of improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those polled, the most of any Gallup poll so far, judged the prime minister was doing his job poorly rather than well.
Ferenci Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny believes or strongly believes 13 percent of the respondents, while Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n’s share of supporters is 38 percent.
The prime minister is not trusted by 54%, the president of the Fidesz movement by 27%.
One of the indicators of the development of the political situation is how much of the public believes that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be resolved without changing the government.
While after last October’s unrest, the government and the prime minister considered the permanence of 35 per cent desirable, at present this share is only 20 per cent, with the relative majority (33 per cent) seeing the solution only in the drafting of new elections.
For the interest in the referendum, it is significant that 60 percent of the respondents answered a question regarding their possible participation, that the referendum would certainly come, and another 20 percent said that it would probably come.
For comparison, "parliamentary elections held this Sunday" would certainly be attended by only 55 percent and another 15 percent consider their participation to be probable. The success of the referendum would be indisputable on the basis of current intentions.
The school would say no to 74, doctor's fees 79, and hospitalization fees 84 percent.
If we look at the same shares only in the circle of people who certainly promise their participation, then the introduction of school fees, doctor’s fees and hospitalization fees would be rejected by 81, 84 and 89 percent.
The most expensive is Auchan, almost a fifth of Tesco
The hypermarkets in the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs trade triangle maintained last year’s, on average, 16 per cent price level growth, with the difference that there was no increase in VAT this year.
Article of the newspaper Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g
The average Christmas basket of the daily newspaper Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g in the business triangle in Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs increased by 16 percent this year, but in all hypermarkets the price showed an increase of more than a thousand forints.
As food prices in supermarkets "emerged" in December last year, there was no such drastic price increase as a percentage of the previous high base.
However, it is certainly unfortunate for consumers that what they could have easily bought last year, at a price below 9,000 forints, will not now be bought at 10,000.
The consumption basket of the Daily Economy in the investigated hypermarkets exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand forints by at least 91 forints.
The highest price of the basket was 10,573 forints.
(In 2003, the consumption basket cost 6,800 forints.)
The price of Unica and live fish remained almost at last year’s level, but they were very irritating to the cruel breasts, nuts and also poppy.
The prices of bread and flour corresponded to the data of the Central Statistical Office, although in Auchan we found a kilogram of bread for 139 forints.
The competition did not go with the price of the product below 200 forints.
Likewise, it was surprising in this store that the price of a two-liter Coca-Cola bottle was below 200 forints, so even with the advance, the product cost only 257 forints.
However, this year, according to the consumer basket of the newspaper Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g Auchan, it appeared to be the most expensive, while Cora appeared to be the cheapest.
According to our calculations, the prices listed in the consumer basket of the newspaper Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g rose by 15 percent compared to last year’s prices for Christmas Cora, while Tesco and Auchan rose by about 18 percent.
When compared to last year’s highest and this year’s lowest consumer basket values, the difference was 12 percent, while growth between last year’s lowest and this year’s highest was 21 percent.
In forints, the increase was on average 1,480.
The average price increase last year came to 1,206 forints, with last year’s Christmas prices being affected by VAT growth.
It is this process that has disrupted trade, and it is obvious that trading houses have not been able to decide how large the price ranges are to be determined for individual products, since they have not been able to predict what effect the change in prices will have on consumption.
(If the trader is planning the speed of circulation of a given product incorrectly, a significant profit may be lost due to the price range adjusted to the intensity of circulation.)
Due to VAT, last year’s rise in the price of the Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g consumer basket was so extreme that the price of the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints higher than in 2006, while for the cheapest one there was a price difference of 844 forints everywhere.
This year the extreme difference did not appear, the most expensive basket now cost 1,630 forints more than last year and also the cheapest rose by 1,284 forints.
When comparing the two Christmas seasons, a catastrophic increase in prices appeared, in less than 20 months, the daily consumption of goods in hypermarkets rose by more than 30 percent.
(This, among other things, is not absolutely confirmed by the data of the Central Statistical Office: it measured a price increase of more than 30 percent in the case of several basic foods within 12 months.
In addition to flour, for example, in the case of eggs.)
In the latter case, however, this seems almost impossible, according to the Consumer Basket of the Daily Economy, since the price level of the product, which was already quite expensive last year, showed a price increase of just over 10 percent, given the base and in the worst case, the price increase.
Flour suppliers appear to be in a stronger position than egg suppliers, and they have managed to push up prices in international chains.
Hypermarkets in the commercial gold triangle are not complaining, they are still reporting a good year.
In our experience, most customers in three visited stores are no longer interested in the price.
Everything is bought by the quanta, durable food is taken at wages.
On Wednesday morning, all three supermarkets had long fronts at the cash registers, as the number of visitors increased sharply.
However, as we know, the turnover in the countryside is lower, several international chains are complaining to research companies that sales are lagging behind their plans, not only in the case of food, but also in the case of durable consumer goods.
In many places, they are saved on disinfectants
This year, more than a thousand cases of infections have been reported in hospitals, mainly due to inappropriate use of antibiotics.
The hygienic conditions of hospitals, overcrowding of beds, the overload of staff stopping the disease do not help, says the mayor of the National Epidemiological Center.
In many places, it is also saved on disinfectants.
Recently, an MRSA infection was diagnosed at the traumatology department of St. John’s Hospital.
Antibiotic-resistant bacteria have been found in a man who got into the hospital after a serious traffic accident.
The patient was isolated.
A similar infection occurred at the same place at the beginning of the year.
A patient injured in a serious car accident was released home, but not long after he had to return with an MRSA infection and due to the bacteria in his body, one important operation could not yet be performed.
As of December 10 this year, 1,094 hospital infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have been reported to the National System of Nesocomialis Surveillance, said Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>czov<0xC3><0xA1>, the National Epidemiological Center’s first female prime minister.
This means that so many infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens have been registered in hospitals with certainty, others are not known.
Nearly two-thirds (683) of infections were caused by MRSA, or methicillin-oxacillin-resistant gold staphylococcus.
The bacteria Staphylococcus aureus (SA) carries a third of the people in the nose without it, without causing disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g. throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, early infections) respond well to antibiotics and can be treated well.
However, if antibiotics are given to an excessive or inappropriate extent, it develops from a bacterium that responds well to antibiotics, a bacterium that is very resistant to antibiotics and that spreads rapidly under inappropriate hospital conditions.
Especially in the case of transient or permanent malfunction of the immune system in patients with a weakened body, low body weight or in patients over the years, it can cause serious hospital infections, such as an early infection or blood poisoning - sepsis.
According to the chief doctor of St. John's Hospital, there is nothing special about MRSA infection, such an infection belongs in hospitals to daily practice.
"The infection must not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is not only there," said Tibor Nyulasi, "where the presence of the causative agent of the disease is not investigated."
Resists Antibiotics
"We isolate these patients, the treatment staff treats them in rubber gloves and in a mask and we have the necessary antibiotics to treat them," said Tibor Nyulasi.
Patients admitted to the hospital are first examined whether MRSA is present in their body, however, infection cannot always be avoided.
Sampling is not in fashion
The vast majority of hospital infections caused by MRSA could be prevented, but the current conditions and conditions in domestic hospitals are not conducive to the prevention of the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens, says Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>czov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Since this infection occurs significantly in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should monitor admitted patients and isolate MRSA carriers immediately.
However, the collection of microbiological samples in Hungarian hospitals is not fashionable.
It also plays a role in the fact that the National Health Insurance Fund does not fund these examinations.
Most cases are detected if the patient suffers from a palpable MRSA infection, said the head of the epidemiology center.
The European Union has strict recommendations for the appropriate treatment of antibiotics in the field of human medicine and there are also domestic guidelines for the treatment of individual infections, morbidity.
Efforts should be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, or microbiological testing should be carried out to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not follow this in all cases.
Sampling of microbiological samples is even rarer in basic or outpatient treatment of patients, Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>czov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
It is stored on disinfectants
According to scientific evidence, MRSA is most often spread among patients through medical personnel.
Therefore, it plays a very important role in hand washing and the use of gloves and masks, but there are serious shortcomings in hospitals, too.
MRSA is transmitted by a droplet infection and by touch, but it is not always possible to isolate infected patients under the conditions of home hospitals.
On the contrary, the rooms are often crowded, the beds are often very close to each other, although from an epidemiological point of view, patients should be at least 1.5 meters away from each other.
As Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>czov<0xC3><0xA1> noted, unfortunately, we can also meet with the fact that in hospitals that are in an adverse material situation, they save on disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients, thus increasing the chances of infections.
According to Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>czov<0xC3><0xA1>, where the necessary protective measures are followed, similar infections are demonstrably less or the further spread of the disease can be stopped.
The Government Program Against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for health insurance companies, which is why it is fought against everywhere.
For example, in England, the government has written a program to prevent MRSA, or reduce its occurrence.
The program appears to be successful, according to published data, MRSA infections in England show a decreasing trend.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) ranks prevention of multi-drug-resistant pathogens (including MRSA) as one of its priorities, i.e. hospital infections caused by these pathogens.
The police captain who caused the fatal accident was not drunk.
The official expert opinion in the case of the police captain of the XXIIth district, who caused the fatal accident, is ready.
It can be excluded that the police captain of the XXII. district, who killed a pedestrian on Tuesday and who in the meantime resigned from his position, would drive under the influence of alcohol or narcotic substances, informed the spokesman of the Supreme State Prosecutor of the capital Attila Morvai on Friday, after the case was completed knowingly.
The expert review confirmed the results of the initial investigation, which already stated that the former police captain had not experienced any alcohol before he took the wheel.
The then Director of Police Directorate of the XXII Circuit on Tuesday in Lajose Kossuth Street in the XXII Circuit crashed his own personal car while turning off a fifty-five-year-old man who entered in front of him while crossing the road outside the designated crossing.
(Lastly, the fact that the pedestrian passed outside the zebra, after all, according to the rules of road traffic is not a mitigating circumstance, the detouring car must still give preference.)
After being transported to the hospital, the pedestrian died.
Due to these events, the district police director resigned from his position and asked to be reassigned to service, according to the police statement, because he was so shaken by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest State Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also mentioned that the former police captain had cooperated from the beginning with the prosecutors carrying out the investigations.
Another <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million for infrastructure
The agreement on three credit frameworks totalling <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million in support of education, transport and environmental infrastructure, as well as energy, was signed in Budapest on Friday by Finance Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and Marta Gajecka, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (EIB).
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) approved a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million framework for Hungary's budget financing of transport and environment projects under the Cohesion Fund, with the parties having previously concluded a loan agreement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million, now in use, signed with
A <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million loan agreement is also used to finance the budget for projects related to education.
The EIB has approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for Hungary for these purposes, the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million may be used later, with the extension of the loan agreement.
In the area of innovation, the parties signed a contract for 50 million euros, which the budget will apply mainly to the research and development project of the University of Debrecen.
There was also talk at the meeting about the 4th metro route.
The parties have agreed that after Hungary has agreed with the EU on the details of the financing of the metro, it will return to whether and how the original contract needs to be modified.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Verese, this could happen in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary amounting to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion.
The interest rate on loans granted by the EIB with a waiting period of eight years and without a commitment commission is linked to the EURIBOR rate.
Bulgaria is an EU real estate paradise
The development of the Bulgarian real estate market is staggering - the attention of the whole of Europe is turning to the previously somewhat neglected Balkan country.
What, where and who is shopping for the still cheapest, but fast-expensive EU market?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The most sought-after Eastern European property purchase destination is now undoubtedly Bulgaria with its cheap ski apartments and houses on the seafront.
The mountains are mostly in the course of the area of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vito<0xC5><0xA1>a, on the sea coast then Albena, Golden Sands, Sunny Beach, the ancient cities of Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are also looking for properties near Kavarna and Bal<0xC4><0x8D>ik.
According to analysts from Re/Max Bulgaria, sooner or later the interest of investors in the central part of the country - for example Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - and more and more people are shopping in the vicinity of the cheap city of Ruse.
Also the capital Sofia is a promise of attractive opportunities, business and office spaces promise the highest return.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, and thus become, next to the summer and winter seasons, a sought-after destination in the next two seasons.
Predicted investors are already shopping in a large, for example, in the vicinity of Bansk<0xC3><0xA1> Bystrica.
According to analysts, buyers of real estate in Bulgaria are trying to change their life and lifestyle at the same time.
Most of the customers come from England, but also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more often also from Romania.
There are also Maltese and Cypriot investors present, along the Black Sea and in the ski paradises there are traditionally many Russian customers.
Foreign buyers can be divided into three groups, says Georgy Jankov, regional director of Re/Max Bulgaria.
Settling people buy either renovated properties worth 50-100 thousand euros, or remodeled old houses for 5-15 thousand euros, which they then renovate.
They require good accessibility and communication options, it is important for them to be close to a big city, shops and, as a rule, a local doctor.
The second category is chat buyers (Bulgaria ranked among the top 10 German holiday destinations in December).
The third group is made up of commercial investors who shop in hopes of rising value in the medium or long term.
The price of real estate in the capital is constant, as the demand is becoming more and more strong.
Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices in the European Union, but has grown by 21 percent per year over the past five years.
The rise in real estate prices significantly exceeds wage growth.
Fodor and the Hungarian 6%
According to the Minister of Environment and Water Management, G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, the meeting of experts will be closed on Tuesday, and after Wednesday’s official launch, the international conference on the climate regime after 2012 will continue the meetings of ministers.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world are discussing the Bali Travel Map, which addresses efforts following the emissions reduction period defined by the Kyoto Protocol in force until 2012.
At the moment, there is a stormy debate about them between developing and developed countries.
The United States has also announced that it does not want to discuss exact figures now, although it is in favour of an agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 25-40 percent by 2020 compared to 1990.
The next big question of the conference is whether the advanced countries will, in addition to reducing emissions, also agree to provide both material and technological assistance to the countries that are referred to it.
The agreement also gave rise to subsidies for developing countries.
The grant fund, established by the Kyoto Protocol, will be managed by the 16-member Governing Council, probably within the framework of the World Environment Programme (GEF) at the United Nations - we can read in the journal Piac és Profit.
Hungarian 6%
Hungary’s Minister of Environment and Water Management, G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, supports the EU’s efforts to maintain its leading role in the global climate protection effort and to help create a new international agreement by 2009.
The Minister said that the EU is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20% by 2020 compared to the 1990 level, regardless of the success of the adoption of the "after 2012 agreement", and is ready to commit to a reduction of up to 30% if other advanced regions of the world and their countries are also affected by the spillover, respectively.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor pointed out that the countries that joined the Kyoto Protocol in 1997 had set themselves the target of a reduction of 5.2 per cent, with the then 15 EU Member States committing to 8 per cent.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6% compared to 1985-87, which our country will do. - recalls the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
There is a lot going on in Bali, because within two years it is necessary to adopt an international agreement on long-term climate change policy, otherwise the international climate change treaty would not have been put into effect until 2012. In such a case, the Kyoto Protocol commitments would not be immediately implemented by the new Kyoto Protocol, nor would the Kyoto Protocol impose a new regime to reduce its emissions.
This would lead to a delay in reducing emissions and an inevitable increase in the average temperature on Earth by more than 2 degrees Celsius, which, according to scientists, would have extremely serious and irreversible consequences.
The British Army is recruiting on YouTube
British military units publish videos from events in Iraq and Afghanistan on a video-sharing server, which they popularize themselves.
The British Air Force (RAF) initially liked YouTube: special forces operating in Afghanistan have been recording videos of the events against the Taliban since March 2006, the BBC reported.
The recordings, taken by a miniature camera attached to the helmet, are controlled by the Air Force headquarters controlling combat operations in the Kandahar area and then sent on to London, where they are transmitted to the Internet.
A political message is inevitable.
In this way, 139 recordings of British air force soldiers have been uploaded to the Internet, and more than 75,000 people have watched their "channel".
The British Ministry of Defence registered itself in the spring of 2007 as "defenceheadquarters" and publishes recordings of events in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Commonwealth Office) and the International Peacekeeping Force in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channels.
Category: Settlements in Afghanistan
The Air Force has released videos according to their original intent for recruitment and according to the Ministry of Defense they are good also to acquaint the general public with the real purpose of the presence of the army abroad.
"The propaganda published in this form, compared to traditional television recruitment ads, is almost worthless," said BBC defence expert Gordon Mackenzie, "but it necessarily also carries a certain political message, since it confirms in a special form the legitimacy of military actions, about them."
The Americans made a game.
The army is concerned that in addition to carefully edited, censored recordings, amateur videos are also received on the server, capturing, for example, the death of soldiers: in a few hypocritical, "official" promotional films, because officers talk about losses at the most, but they do not pretend.
After all, many videos from the battlefields in Iraq and Afghanistan, which were created during the sharp deployment, have already been uploaded to the Internet, but the British army has only found out about them so far.
Americans perform the recruitment a little differently - using a shooting game called America's Army, which is free to download and in which the player can get directly into the skin of the soldiers through a more or less faithful simulation.
At the ministries there will be Christmas with a raffle and locusts
The Minister of Labour, M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Lamperth, is apparently not sentimental: instead of a Christmas party, she organizes a final working meeting for her co-workers, at which she will say goodbye to crockery and coffee with 2007.
In some ministries there will be a celebration with live music, elsewhere it will enchant the Christmas atmosphere officials with a raffle and a drink.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and a Swedish table - that's how the powerful enjoy themselves.
Government offices are also being set up for Christmas.
The most expensive ministerial Christmas celebration this year will be organized by the Ministry of Defense, but it does not expect its employees to do so.
At Christmas orphans receive gifts from the children of fallen soldiers, during Mission Christmas family members of soldiers, currently serving on foreign missions, but also organize receptions for journalists.
The resort dedicates 25 million to the atmosphere at the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (NF<0xC3><0x9C>) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (GKM) will throw themselves out of the ditch, compared to other ministries.
The GKM event is held in the centre of J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91> H<0xC3><0xA1>za, for a total of 4,320,000 forints and of the six hundred employees of the Ministry, approximately three hundred and fifty guests are expected.
The resort will adhere to Christmas traditions at its celebration, but there will also be various performances and a raffle will be drawn.
The Christmas NF<0xC3><0x9C> cost 4,700,000 forints and took place on Wednesday in the building of the State Council of Justice (OIT) - there were concerts and dinners on the program.
Renting the hall cost a million forints, the rest was spent on more than four hundred guests.
It seems that one department of the NF<0xC3><0x9C> is invited to yet another Christmas celebration: here will be organized by the tendering company, the Hungarian Center for Economic Development (MAG) from EU money.
For this purpose, they rented the building of the V<0xC3><0xAD>gsz<0xC3><0xAD>nh<0xC3><0xA1>z theatre.
MAG a. s. has not confirmed this information, as we have not been able to reach the person concerned.
Suits are not required
The ILO building hosted not only the NF<0xC3><0x9C>, but also the Ministry of Justice and Security, which held the St. Lucia ball on December 7 instead of Christmas.
However, the ILO did not want money from him using its halls.
Five hundred people took part in the dance.
The evening began with the Minister of Health, after dinner it was possible to dance with live music.
According to the answer to the question of the portal [origo] at the ball were not required evening dresses or suits at all.
The Puritan party is being prepared by the health, labor and local government departments.
The Ministry of Health organizes a program and celebration for employees for 400,000 forints in their own building.
Labor Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Lamperth does not even officially invite employees to a Christmas party, but to a final working meeting.
There are one hundred and eighty guests who, according to the press department, will receive only coffee and croissants, so only 350,000 forints will be enough for the party.
The Minister of Local Government Gordon Bajnai and his colleagues will simply drink in the hall of the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development.
The Ministry of Finance (PM) is organizing a Christmas meeting, which is expected to be attended by 436 workers, in its own large hall.
At the Christmas party, he spends 2,500 forints per guest - the total amount includes a reception with Swedish tables and a toast.
Since J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres has been minister, PMs have celebrated Christmas in a similar way every year.
However, the atmosphere of the party will be lacking, the officialness is reinforced not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the afternoon time of the event.
The farm resort hosts a New Year's reception on January 20th, and there will be no Minister's Christmas.
The reception will take place in Vajdahunyadv<0xC3><0xA1>r Castle in the Municipal Gardens and according to the Ministry of Tourism, 1,000 forints per person are allocated for one hundred guests.
According to the press department, it will be a very simple reception, to which only the relevant foreign diplomats accredited in Hungary are invited.
These annual receptions start with a short health minister and end with a small reception.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Education and Culture do not organize Christmas parties at all, the relevant press department told the [origo] portal.
The price of the Christmas celebrations of the Ministry of the Environment in the press department could not be announced.
In any case, four hundred people were invited to a party held at the Museum of Art and Industry.
He's leaning towards a huge strike.
The League of Trade Unions, or the National Union of Workers' Councils (MOSZ), will set up its strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday's open-ended strike.
A protest public meeting will be held on Saturday, and work will be halted on Monday - the day of the final vote on the Health Insurance Act.
The action will certainly cause a serious disruption of transport, as almost all rail traffic will be stopped and employees of the Budapest Transport Company (BKV) will also be on strike within 1 p.m.
On Friday afternoon, the League will meet with the National Union of Workers’ Councils to discuss the details of the jointly organized Monday strike.
There will also be a strike commission LIGA - MOSZ, which will coordinate the action on Monday.
A public protest meeting is held on Saturday, and unions joining the strike will stop work indefinitely if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that no deadline has been set for the strike to end on the day of the parliamentary vote on the Health Insurance Act.
If Parliament does not finally adopt the Health Insurance Act, the unions will immediately withdraw the call for strike action.
However, if the legislation is voted on, the strike commission will meet and decide on the next procedure.
According to the Monday's agenda of Parliament's meeting, it is also possible that the health insurance law will be voted on only in the late evening or, if necessary, at night.
Due to the beginning of the strike on Monday, it is possible to count on serious interruptions of transport: on the railway the work will be stopped for an indefinite period, in the morning part of the Budapest public transport and more than half of the Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n companies can be stopped.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the road will also be closed.
Numerous trade unions and civil society organisations joined the call for strikes, the list of which is constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some organizations announced the strike for an indefinite period of time, others declared a temporary stoppage of work.
Until Thursday afternoon, the Hungarian State Railways (MAV) and the Independent Trade Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ) were unable to agree on adequate services, with more and more people travelling on the railway at the beginning of the Christmas holidays.
According to previous reports, from the beginning of operation to 1 p.m. will strike at BKV, from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. at Budapest Airport, a four-hour strike will be organized by the Trade Unions of Workers in the Energy Industry LIGA, to a 2-, respectively 2-8-hour stop of work called by the Trade Union of Educators and Democrats.
The Association of Hungarian Doctors will strike alternately throughout the country, the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (EDDSZ), belonging to the Cooperative Forum of Trade Unions (SZEF), is organizing a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands formulated by the League is for the government to revoke the health insurance reform proposal and submit a new concept for public discussion.
The second requirement is that the new method of calculating pensions in force from next year be introduced gradually.
Thirdly, the possibility of inclusion in the system before 2010 is ensured for early retirement for the relevant employment sectors.
The fourth reason for the action is that the Independent Trade Union of Railway Employees (VDSZSZ), falling under the trade union League, does not accept the offer of the Ministry of Economy and Transport regarding railway branches, and expects another offer.
Political Capital: Hungarian Guards Increase Country Risk
The activity of the Hungarian Guard, founded with the support of the Jobbik Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért movement in August of this year, according to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital Institute, immediately increased the political risk of Hungary and the whole region in several respects.
In the "risk warning" developed by the company, it is written: in connection with the activity of the Hungarian Guard, the greatest political risk is that "the already existing ethnic tension between the Roma and non-Romani population of Hungary can soon lead to violent ethnicities".
The main reason is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably aimed at provoking such an action - adds the research institute.
As he writes, all this can be explained by one of the greatest negligence of Hungarian political leaders: "public discussion on the Roma question was left to representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who could build a political strategy on the Roma-Hungarian contradiction."
This deepens the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts – the institute judges.
In addition, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, according to the research institute, due to the great attention of both domestic and foreign media, "has greatly distorted the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards the belief in the stability of the country and its democratic development".
As part of the reorganisation of Hungarian radical and far-right groups, which has been receiving increasing publicity and vehemence since the autumn of 2006, several organisations have been formed in Hungary since the summer of 2007, which call themselves "National Home Guard" associations.
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil associations, while openly declaring - even armed - the readiness of their members to carry out defensive tasks (in the event of natural disasters, invasion of the country, disruption of order), in addition to pointing out the incapacity of the police, the army, or the state," he said.
He further notes: all this is happening in a way that seeks to wrap up the various political efforts built on society’s opposition to politics and parties in civilian clothes.
The emphasis on civility and the form of the association, therefore, in the case of these groups, is not only used to avoid legal obstacles to judicial registration, but is also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk-increasing factor in terms of neighbouring relations.
"In recent months, in several neighbouring countries, the Hungarian Guard has been pointed out as a potential source of danger, and the ultra-nationalist political leaders of some neighbouring countries have called for the Hungarian Guard to apologize for their own anti-Hungarian policies.
All this can affect the political stability of the region," he adds.
According to the research institute, the emergence of the Hungarian Guard in Central and Eastern Europe is not a unique phenomenon, so the political risks for the region as a whole have increased.
As he writes, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar, for example, to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, the creation of which was announced in August 2007 by the ultra-right Bulgarian National Union (BNU).
Against the background of the formation of the Bulgarian Guard, there are mass Romani riots that broke out in one of the Sofia neighborhoods (Krasna Poljana).
The BNU used it to establish a guard with the goal of "national defense".
According to her, in the past 17 years there has been "gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, but the state has remained inactive and indifferent, recalls the Institute Political Capital.
He adds that the initiative provoked a stormy discussion among the Bulgarian public.
As it goes on to write, the increased risk of ethnic clashes signals the announcement of some Bulgarian Romani organizations that they will create their own guard on the sign of resistance.
Since the activity of the Hungarian Guard is similar to the activity of the Bulgarian National Guard, it is not excluded that Hungarian Roma respond to the threat in a similar way by establishing their own defence, we can read in the risk warning prepared by the Political Capital Institute.
Asked by the press office, Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, research director of the Political Capital Institute, said: Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, risk analysis is issued every year and if they find anything that could affect the change of risk, they inform the public opinion, as in this case by issuing a risk warning.
Holidays are not everywhere free
In Hungary, holidays are strictly regulated by law and it has already become a common practice that working days are moved around the holidays, which is expected less often next year.
In the European Union and in the United States, holidays are not uniform.
The Hungarian legal system distinguishes between national and state holidays and working days of rest.
The days of work rest are usually devoted to church holidays or to important historical events.
We also celebrate the New Year: the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year is free of work - on New Year's Day already so that people can relax after New Year's Eve.
During the year we have a total of eleven free holidays.
The national holiday is the 15th of March, celebrating the Revolution of 1848 and the 23rd of October, commemorative day of the Revolution of 1956.
On August 20, we celebrate the founding of the state, on May 1, work, on November 1 and 2, we remember the deceased relatives and friends.
In addition, we have two-day holidays Easter, Summer and Christmas.
Since our national, national, or religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend according to the calendar, it has become the practice to move the working day in cases where we would only work one day before or after the holiday.
The price for extended weekends, of course, is that we stay in the workplace and at school on the previous Saturdays.
When we work out the day immediately preceding or following the holiday, the Minister of Labor has been making a special decree for many years.
The legislation applies equally to all employers and their employees, to public employees as well as to persons in the public service.
It does not, however, apply to companies and institutions which are in operation without interruption or which, with regard to their intended purpose, also operate on working days of rest.
This year there will be a change in the working order only around the holidays at the end of the year: from December 24, life in the country will almost stop, because according to previous experience, most people work days between Christmas and New Year's Eve in advance or thus take advantage of a saved holiday.
Next year, several of our holidays fall in the middle, or at the end of the week, respectively, so that the shifts of the working day will be less than this year.
For the first time, the calendar changes around Labor Day so that workers can then stay at home for four days of taste.
Saturday 26 April will be a working day, so that Friday 2 May can be a day of rest.
Another shift is related to the holiday of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, the place will be working on Friday, October 24.
However, the end of the year next year will be able to take place entirely in celebration of the holidays, because from December 24 they will have almost everywhere non-stop holidays even though New Year's Eve falls on Wednesday.
6 Disturbing Little Things You Can Do to Get Your Colleagues Angry
Emails that we forget to send, voice messages that we never receive, innocent lies that we hardly notice anymore: all this "furthers up" everyday in the workplace.
The question is, do you get used to these minor inconveniences, or do you put on gloves, and in unclear situations that can anger others, you will deliberately avoid them.
Tips.
"I'm sorry, I forgot to tell you that they were looking for you from the marketing department," a colleague will tell you.
That you missed a meeting because of it?
At best, he regrets it and tries to correct it, or calls the marketing department and says he forgot to send the message (this is a less common solution).
Most often, the matter is resolved with an apology.
Before there is an embarrassing apology, it is good to think about what you could do to prepare your colleagues for unpleasant moments, and consciously try to avoid it.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more unpleasant than stretching for some paperwork, office needs, or for your phone, and they’re not there.
Remember you put a stapler on your desk last night, but it's gone by morning?
Or did you discover on the table of one of your colleagues your pen, which you considered lost?
Do not take anything from your colleagues without permission, otherwise they will be rightfully angry at you for getting into their affairs.
Don’t take envelopes or stickers out of the office, as it can be uncomfortable if they run out prematurely, and you’ll need them immediately.
Rumors about the private life of colleagues?
There is no good way to stop the spread of ticks.
Who, with whom, what was he doing?
Where and why?
Don’t tell everyone about your (guessing) colleagues’ private lives!
If any of them share their innermost secrets with you, do not abuse their trust!
Lock up what you have heard, and in his absence do not check it with your colleagues, even when others know about his things.
Do you report your absence for no reason?
If you call the office and report your absence with a strong headache, because you are not well, or you say that you would rather rest today, think about it, your work, urgent tasks and work, for which they have a certain deadline, someone will have to do it for you.
Take care of your colleagues!
If you know in advance that you will not go to work the next day, or that something may happen that will make you have to stay home, report it so that your colleagues and leaders are not confronted with your absence until the next day.
Snoring, sneezing, phone calls
Did you dive into a job that you'd be rudely pulled out of by your sneezing coworker?
Unwittingly, have you witnessed a telephone conversation that would be better not to hear at all?
Do not interrupt your co-workers with abuse, chanting, loud talk (over their heads), or jerking, constant swearing, loud discontent.
All this can be disruptive even when they are not involved in any project (writing, planning, organization).
Are you blaming others for your mistakes?
If something is not on time or you have forgotten to send an important letter or message, do not blame the other for your forgetfulness!
Do not resort to the possible chaos prevailing in the office and noisy colleagues!
Admit if you made a mistake and someone paid for it, and fix the damage!
Ask how you could put things in order, fix the negligence!
Do you feel at home in the office?
Sweatshirts and slippers: comfortable clothes at home, but does not fit in the office!
Don’t wear clothes for your free time, even if your profession allows it!
Do not be careless, honor your colleagues and yourself by coming to the office in regular dresses - and if your profession requires it, nicely and elegantly!
When a man wants to please, he ceases to be interesting
Travelling in the usual morning traffic jam.
A special melody will be heard from the radio: the sound of the violin, to which electronic effects are attached.
I'm adding volume.
The music changes the tempo and the bass is added to the previous tone, then the female chorus joins as a real jewel.
On the mr2 station is a song by the band Zagar called Wings of Love.
Home music life hasn’t smeared us with quality electronic pop for a long time.
But suddenly the congestion looks quite different, because you are just listening to the new album Zagaru.
The appearance of Yonderboie, a couple of new and interesting productions coming from the home digital underground, the overall picture is slowly changing, and although it is back in fashion garage rock with its beat into the guitar, even the home electropop proves that there is something new under the sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger started in F<0xC3><0xAA>tikosteli and he also played in Yonderboi's band, until he finally - perhaps because two duds do not fit into one line - went his own way.
However, with his project (Zagar) and music that combines elements of jazz, electronic dance styles and pop, he began to break through when he was invited to compose film soundtracks (e.g.
film Ference T<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>ka "Szezon").
His formations, initially playing in smaller clubs, met a wider audience after wan2 magazine ranked their first album of 2002 among the fifty most important home records and declared Zagar at Yonderboie as almost the only domestic entities determining the development that could be sold even in the West.
Zagar and his band are undoubtedly "on course", although of course no one asked them if they were satisfied with this sticker.
The band responded as follows: they made a new, better album.
The now-released album, Cannot Walk Fly Instead, may open new avenues for them, though the title itself attempts to create a sequel to the early years in Five-Tails.
This is a verse from the song by the old band Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zse Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
The reference to ethereal, flying would be in place, but besides the ethereal inspiration of this music has now appeared - in accordance with the spirit, the trend of the time - louder guitar, the influence of rock and roll.
In these songs, the singer Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rgy Ligeti, currently working in England with the group The Puzzle, premiered the album in Millen<0xC3><0xA1>ris Park.
The album also produced a real radio hit, thanks to mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi station, playing popular music recently from morning to evening, we began to jam the extensive melodies of the song Wings of Love, recorded with six home singers ("Underground Divas").
So everything is fine (?).
The hvg.hu portal told Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: In connection with this new hit, the question arises: how much of what you are playing remains marginal music?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The definition of marginal music means nothing to me.
In my opinion, there are two different castes of light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and honest.
Even so-called alternative, underground music can be flat, say nothing, and just like that it can only be made for sale, which makes it commercial.
However, even a good pop song can come from a sincere inner need.
In this spirit, the attitude as it is adopted, regardless of language and state borders, also works.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference in the openness of Hungarian and foreign audiences to your music?
B. Zs.: In foreign, especially from us to the west, light music has a larger tradition.
There are not only teenagers and people in their twenties, but also older people.
Much more are watching the transformations of light music taking place around them, as they also consider it to be part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What is the role of the audience in your work?
Do you care about who, where and how many people listen to your music?
B. Zs.: Of course it’s a good feeling that more and more people are coming to our concerts.
But we never made music for the market.
Music is not born for a purpose, but for a reason.
The role of the audience can be perceived more in concerts, where there is already a mutual influence, but this is hidden only in the undetectable transformations of the moment.
Still, I noticed that when a person wants to please the audience, he ceases to be interesting from that moment on.
hvg.hu: How much are you going to follow the example of Yonderboie?
He works solo and has built his career more from us to the west.
B. Zs.: We don’t actually go his way, regardless of the fact that our music is sometimes trying to explain itself.
Rather, we are team players who rely on the musical presence of the other and let it develop.
At first, of course, we could not avoid not comparing our work to the songs of Yonderboie, because several of us separated from his band and went on a different path.
hvg.hu: In the toplist of mr2 Pet<0xC5><0x91>fi, the song Wings of Love came in first place.
Many have heard the name Zagar for the first time in connection with this song.
In a more popular style, have you consciously opened up to wider layers?
B.Zs.: We didn’t plan to write a hit to sell the record.
There's more to this song.
We intended it as a final album, which we tried to release the previous sound orgy and more complex themes.
HVG: How did you choose these six singers?
Why is it - what was the main principle?
B.Zs.: The idea was to create such a gospel choir.
Then the idea came to assemble this choir of soloists from the home music scene with a good voice.
So this six-member choir - Sena, Edina Kutzora, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC5><0x91> Hodosi [Neo], Juci Németh - was put together, which we then renamed Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Is that how you intended the song, or did the girls make something out of it?
B.Zs.: The song has long existed in the instrumental version, when the material was then assembled on the record, we thought that there would be something else needed for this song.
The sequence of the chords led to the singing part being added to it.
That day and night I sang a melody to him, which the girls later learned.
It all came out almost for the first time and very spontaneously.
I remember how it came to life, but of course it needed Divya to do it.
With my voice, it wouldn't work so energetically.
hvg.hu: Both on the record and at the concert it seemed like there were girls in the background.
They don’t have a solo (except Judy Jay), they don’t have a role of their own, they sing together and they’re not louder than the music, so the music just doesn’t accompany their singing.
They were also at the back of the stage.
Is that intentional?
B.Zs.: The fact that they were standing in the back was only because of technical problems.
The fact that we did not want to divide the solo roles, on the contrary, is intentional.
Even that song is about forgetting our egos a little bit, where they come from, where they belong, and just letting those wings lift the wings of love.
I wished that this euphoric state, which we felt when the song was born, could be felt by others.
HVG.HU: What was the most work done?
B.Zs.: During the composition of the music, in fact, even with one, heavier pieces occurred rather when mixing.
For example, Dorian Gray's Dilemma, in which I play on the concert wing, or Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where he has not wanted to work groove for a long time, then everything has slowly found its place in some sort of puzzle.
hvg.hu: Which track from the new album is your favorite?
B.Zs.: This is still changing with the concert and the fact that I have already "released" the album.
Now it's Prophet Is A Fool, Escape From The Earth and Never The Same.
A Betrayal Broker Risked Billions of Depreciations
Cheating defrauder.
This is how the French banking giant Société Générale, owner of the domestic Commercial Bank, refers to his illustrious employee Jerome Kerviel.
It cost him almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion.
But it seems that Kerviel was just a big player who wanted to make up with his colleagues and was certainly not incapacitated.
Unlike all the big banking houses, he recognized in time the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He's mentally weaker," his superiors said, sending him to the police.
But according to Kerviel’s statement, which was made by the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of 1.6 billion euros from his trades.
The crisis not only in America
"All I wanted was to make money for my bank," he said in a statement.
In the summer, he managed to earn half a billion euros just on the American crisis.
He had the opportunity at the beginning of the year.
In February, reports began to emerge that so-called sub-prime mortgages, provided to low-income clients or those who have had problems with repayment in the past, will have problems.
However, this crisis should not have had an impact on the entire economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and bet it right.
At the end of the year, his profit rose to 1.6 billion euros.
"When I made my first half-billion, I didn't know how to announce it," Kerviel admits, adding that he certainly didn't leave anything to himself.
Throughout the interrogation, he admits that he was falsifying the records so that he could not be found.
He even managed to fool his bosses, even though Eurex began to be interested in his trades.
The risk was profit.
Was he afraid he'd find it?
I don't think so.
"I thought the simple fact that I made $1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them."
Where did he take so much risk?
He had to work out his position gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000 shortly after studying at the University of Lyon.
His annual salary was about $51,000.
Two years later, he was already an assistant broker and in 2005 he became an independent broker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Yet he knew that he would never earn as much as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I knew I was being bullied.
Because of my education and also because of my professional and personal development," Kerviel told investigators.
But shortly after the start, the first big success came.
Thanks to the actions of Allianz, he earned, in the bombing of London, he bet half a billion euros on the fall of this title.
And that was the trigger mechanism - he wanted more.
As long as you make money, we'll let you
"It's like a snowball," he told the police.
But the bosses said they knew all about it, if they knew.
"As long as I was making money, they were blindfolded."
But then the morning came at the beginning of this year.
He lost a billion dollars in one day.
After the weekend in mid-January, he wanted to put it down.
When he came to work on Monday, he no longer worked at the bank.
And the bank reported a few days later that it had lost five billion euros because of him.
And how did they find him?
He became a suspect because of his vacation.
"I've only chosen four days in the past year.
A broker who doesn’t have a vacation is a broker who doesn’t want anyone to look at his records,” Kerviel concluded.
Czech Republic has a chance to win $365 billion
Ministers of the Czech Government and representatives of the European Commission signed a total of nine operational programmes, of which the Czech Republic may receive <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion (approximately CZK 365 billion) in the coming years.
This is roughly half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can receive from Brussels between 2007 and 2013.
Approximately CZK 125 billion will go from the seven operational programmes to the regions.
Czech companies will be able to receive around CZK 100 billion from the Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme.
The most money, up to 150 billion, will go to transport.
The Transport programme is the largest operational programme and represents up to 22 per cent of the funds that the Czech Republic can receive from the funds.
This money will increase the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructure, which will manage the amount of CZK 90.8 billion next year.
The Entrepreneurship and Innovation programme is intended to serve entrepreneurs and companies to raise funds for innovative entrepreneurship.
Firms should obtain funding for the introduction of new technologies, for industrial research, but also for the introduction of more effective organizational methods.
So far, the Czech Republic has been one of the least successful in drawing money from EU funds within the newly adopted countries.
Nicaraguan ex-president sentenced to 20 years in prison
A Nicaraguan appeals court on Thursday upheld a 20-year sentence for former President Arnold Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, who was convicted in 2003 of financial fraud amounting to $100 million (almost $1.8 billion).
However, he was later released from prison and lived in a home prison on his hacienda near the Nicaraguan metropolis.
Whether the former head of this Central American state from 1997 to 2002 will return behind bars is not clear at this time, according to the AP.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérezov<0xC3><0xA1>, it will now be up to the prison officials to let the German serve his sentence at home or to travel to prison.
A court four years ago proved to Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n that he regularly transferred government money to the accounts of foreign companies in Panama.
These companies were fictitious and the accounts were in fact owned by his relatives and closest supporters.
Some of this money then ended up in a fund that Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n founded to fund his election campaign in 2001.
So they approved our budget.
That's right.
The state budget was adopted.
What makes this budget special?
It is the first budget drawn up by this government and adopted by the coalition majority without the support of the opposition.
This year he passed with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, because he was prepared by Minister Sobotka and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not afford to not accept him.
Unlike the tumultuous debate before the vote of no confidence in the government, this time nothing dramatic happened.
The Chamber of Deputies passed this traditionally overlooked, though most influential, law in peace.
It's a paradox.
Every government begins and ends with individual chapters and budget items, whether one likes it or not.
The budget is an essential part of politics, but it is hidden behind the government’s power competition with the opposition.
This is more media-thankful, and therefore much more attention is paid to it in the media.
Arguing politicians is much more interesting to the public than string numbers.
The state budgets of past social democratic governments have suffered three ailments, which the one for 2008 is not able to solve at once:
The first of these is a high share of the law’s mandatory, so-called mandated expenses, which are not only pensions, but also social benefits, which were approved last year before the elections by the silent “coalition” of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second is the deficit economy as a result of the misery of the first.
The third limit is the deficit of public finances, i.e. the deficit of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
The biggest risk, however, is the state budget deficit.
It is public and relatively under control.
However, the temporary bomb is the deficit of the budgets of cities and municipalities.
Many mayors, in addition to money from taxes, fees and loans from banks, to obtain additional resources for investment, often issue headless bonds, through which they unduly indebted their mayors.
In recent years, they have been able to repay these debts by mass selling shares of energy and other distribution networks that they have received from the state in privatization.
They no longer have that resource.
If we stick to only official and verifiable facts, we will find that:
Our economy has been going through a growth phase for several years now, as has the rest of the world, making the Czech SSR proud all the time.
This was a unique opportunity for her governments to put public finances in order.
Instead, the state was increasingly in debt.
Other countries, except for a few exceptions such as Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have managed much more intelligently than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls mainly on the previous government.
We are among the countries that are, on a global scale, least at risk of poverty.
Therefore, there is no need for massive social programs, which, unfortunately, in recent years have become completely unnecessary in gigantic dimensions.
Although it has managed to cancel some of the senseless populist spending approved this year before the elections, so if in the near future there is no pushing the boundaries of retirement and pension reform, then in fact any policy in this country will end and whoever governs it will be just an office.
With a little exaggeration, it can be said that the ruling politicians will become officials, mechanically dividing most of the tax money into pensions and social benefits.
Therefore, this year’s budget cannot be revolutionary, but it can only suspend the expulsion of normal expenditure by mandated expenditure.
A projected deficit of $70 billion per year in 2008 would be utterly useless if past governments did not do what they could in the last ten years.
If we do not really want to see the ruling politicians become the hands of officials, then we must be patient and allow this not too strong coalition government, which is aware that the state can spend only as much as it can get on taxes and fees, peace to prepare for further reforms of the law.
Only these will allow the gradual achievement of a balanced state budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the central banks of Britain, Switzerland and Canada have decided to fight together against the crisis in the financial markets.
More than a hundred billion dollars will be put into the currency markets through auctions.
In these auctions, banks attract interest rates for which they are willing to lend money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send $40 billion to the auction, and then make another twenty-four more available to the European and Swiss central banks.
This is the first time since the attacks of 11 September that the central banks of individual states have agreed on such a coordinated procedure to prevent or reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step is intended to address the biggest economic challenge, the growing lack of free capital that banks could borrow,” Bernard Baumohl of Economic Outlook Group, a consulting firm, wrote in a report to clients.
"Coordinated central bank action has reduced the likelihood of a recession in the United States from 65 percent to 50 percent," Baumohl said in a statement.
Banks have already lost $60 billion due to outstanding loans, especially in the United States.
Analysts expect another $1 billion in losses.
“Central banks must be really afraid of what might happen when they decide to do this,” said ABN Chief Economist Amro Kieran Davies.
"It looks like the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks are concerned that if banks themselves have difficult access to loans, they will also lend to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with potential impacts on global economic growth.
The central banks thus decided after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used to lend money on the interbank market.
This meant that banks were still concerned about lending money to each other, despite the fact that the central banks of the US, Canada and Britain had reduced their interest rates several times during the fall.
"This will have the same effect as another interest rate drop," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some analysts do not believe that the move by central banks will contribute to fueling the crisis because it does not solve the underlying problem, and that is the collapse of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: The debates of environmentalists are incredible
Global climate change is expected to do the most damage to developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
Criticism has now been voiced at the closing UN International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he said that the debates of environmentalists are incredible.
According to Klaus, not only is the structure of the conference unacceptable, which consists of a strange mixture of representatives of governments and non-governmental organizations, but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric that accompanies it and reality.
"The debate there is completely unstructured, it's just a fireworks display of words that are a substitute for solving current problems," Klaus said.
During the presentation of his book, the Czech President stressed that her topic is very important to him, and that is why he is so committed to them.
He also expressed satisfaction with the fact that the book also appears in the German translation, because, as he said, "I often only meet with caricatures of my opinions".
Now, therefore, the interested parties can read his unconverted attitudes.
Klaus recalled that although he is not a climatologist, in his opinion, he has enough assumptions to write such a book.
After all, he is an academic, able to monitor and assess professional treatises, has experience with statistics and is also a national economy.
The main conclusions of the book are that the climate is constantly changing and its changes are therefore normal, that there is no consensus of all scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not too great and serious and therefore do not pose a threat, and that efforts to influence the development of the climate are not too difficult.
Moreover, as a person with experience of totality, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous restriction of freedom.
On the questions of those present, he repeatedly explained that he is not against “reasonable environmental protection, but against militant environmentalism, which does not take into account the relationship between costs and their usefulness”.
Klaus spoke on the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayek Institute.
The driver has not been able to replace 600,000 people.
Six hundred thousand drivers have missed the deadline and have not been able to exchange the old driver’s license, which will expire at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can apply for an exchange so that the authorities can still issue them a new card by the end of the year.
But the ministry is not afraid that after the New Year, hundreds of thousands of drivers will take to the road without a valid license.
According to the authorities, the license was not exchanged mainly by those who do not even want to drive anymore.
While the municipality is reporting a sharp decline in interest in replacing the driver's license, the authorities in the metropolis are overwhelmed by applications and interest in replacing the license has increased this week.
The Magistrate handles about 2,000 clients a day.
It takes about half an hour on the front lines.
In Prague, the driver’s license has not yet been exchanged by about 140,000 drivers.
The issuance of a new card takes 20 days.
However, it is possible to request an issue within a shortened period of five days.
In this case, the driver will pay five hundred crowns.
Motorists who do not reach a mandatory license exchange by the end of the year and go on the road without a valid driver's license will face a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
However, a police officer may also deal with the offence by agreement.
In the case of an administrative offence, the fine shall be increased to CZK 2500.
According to previous information, he could receive a fine from the city hall and a person who is not going anywhere.
He could have paid <0xC2><0xA3>30,000.
The ministry has previously urged the authorities to be moderate and to impose a fine of up to a thousand crowns.
According to transport ministry spokesman Karl Hanzelka, there is no threat of tens of thousands of fines.
According to him, a driver’s license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It’s not a passport that everyone must have.
People who no longer want to drive should give up their driver’s license.
Simply take it away or send it by mail to the relevant municipal office.
By the end of the year, they will cease to pay for the cards issued between 1964 and 1993.
Motorists, however, have to gradually exchange other types of driver’s licenses.
People with documents from 1994 to 2000 have three more years to exchange.
The validity of the licences issued between 2001 and 2004 shall expire in December 2013.
According to Hanselka, there are about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the penalties for detectives associated with Berdych
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, who are accused of criminal association with the gang of David Berdych, will go to prison for thirteen and ten years.
With definitive validity, the Prague Supreme Court decided on this, which reduced their sentences, one by one and the other by two years.
Originally, it threatened the detectives of the Prague Department for Combating Organized Crime for 14 and 12 years.
Today's decision can no longer be appealed, it is only possible to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also indicted in this case, but is still awaiting a first instance verdict.
In other cases, however, he has already received sentences in excess of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the regional court acknowledged the involvement of 19 people in robberies, and the Supreme Court today ruled on the appeal of 16 of them.
Since the beginning of the investigation, most of the defendants have rejected the accusation, claiming that it was a fabricated case.
According to the Central Czech Senate, by agreement with Berdych, the police transferred information from police sources to the criminals, covered up individual robberies and helped gang members avoid criminal liability.
The gang gave 30 percent of the loot to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The charges involved the criminal activities of the gang from 1999 to 2001.
In particular, robberies, the victims of which have often suffered serious damage to health, but also abuses of public authority and illicit armaments.
During their home visits, the police discovered illegally held pistols, steel-core missiles, a laser pointer, or a gun.
The gang is accused of stealing tens of millions of crowns.
In addition to nearly twenty men in the process, the courts have already ruled guilty of other robberies of Berdych and a number of other people.
Other men from the Berdych area are still testifying before the court in another trial, some cases have not yet arrived before the court.
The main portrayal has so far been avoided by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who are in Irish custody, awaiting a final decision on their extradition to the Czech Republic.
Child Exchange Account: $12 million
For the exchange of children in the maternity hospital, the lawyer of the damaged families Igor Veleba wants to compensate 12 million crowns after the Trebic hospital, plus court costs.
For each of the mothers three million, for the fathers two million and for the children one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l therefore fundamentally disagrees with the proposal of the Veleba.
"We reject such a request, it is very much high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today's meeting.
"But in order to make an opinion on this counter-proposal, we need an expert opinion that the counterparty has had to draw up.
Let's see if it's worth anything at all.
But we remain in the opinion that it will be in the hundreds of thousands for all," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l stressed.
According to him, the amount should be between 100,000 and 200,000 CZK for each of the four parents.
At the beginning of the case, the Jablonov family wanted one million crowns for every month they did not raise their biological daughter.
Veleb served as a basis for negotiations on a compensation expert opinion, which was prepared for him by the Faculty Hospital in Prague-Motole.
Parents of children, according to experts in psychology and psychiatry, suffered psychological damage and stress at various degrees and depths.
The stress situation was better tolerated by men, even though they faced reproaches that they did not prevent the confusion of newborns.
Women, on the other hand, deal more with the actuality of the trauma experienced and with what is happening right now, summarized the contents of the Veleba.
Veronica and Nikola were replaced by nurses in the T<0xC5><0x99>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D> maternity ward on December 9.
Last week the children returned to their biological parents - Nikola to <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> to Przybyslavic and Veronika to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojan<0xC3><0xA1> to Jablonov.
At the end of October, Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina's mayor Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il handed over 100,000 crowns to each of the families to compensate for the expenses incurred by them due to the error of the Trebic hospital that the region is setting up.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are legally insured for damages.
In case of error, they must reach the reserve fund, exceptionally they can ask for the assistance of the founder.
The courts have so far conceded relatively little compensation to the people, the sums have been calculated according to tables in the order of hundreds of thousands, with the exception of millions of crowns.
Soil lost to the Kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the dispute over the brand of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the Ostrava Regional Court, although the name was first used by the King of Wallachia, the project was built by a long-term team around Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, who collaborated with the actor.
The party did not take part in the meeting today.
But according to his lawyer, the case probably won't end and the client will appeal.
"The dispute is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasitizing on the popularity of Bolka Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka," said Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vk's lawyer after the trial.
According to him, everyone in the words of the Kingdom of Wallachia will be equipped with actors and comedians.
Harabish is of the same opinion.
“We have nearly a decade of work behind us.
Money laundering and the fabrication of actions," he said.
According to him, they are the cause of a dispute over money.
"Over the years, they realized that the project was successful and could have something to do with it.
They want to parasitize our work," he added.
Charitable business
According to the court of designation, the Wallachian king used Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka for the first time in his television program.
In 1993, he was crowned by actor Radoslav Brzobohaty.
But that was not the case at the time with the intention of building a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of issuing Wallachia passports.
From the original recessionist action, trade and lucrative business activity were excluded, to which then Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> continued the establishment of the company of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka agreed to put his name and signature on passports and even offered their holders discounts when visiting his farm and theater performances.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also said today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used the bare idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka published in the manga for his business purpose.
"The popularity of Boles<0xC5><0x82>aw Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's project of the Kingdom of Wallachia certainly helped," the judge said.
But she added that the soul of the project was Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team, which was intensely dedicated to him.
The cooperation of today's disaffected parties continued until 2000, when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized an official coronation for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Since then, however, disputes between Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> began to accumulate, culminating in the deposition of "King Boles<0xC5><0x82>aw I elected to the fold".
The leading role in the kingdom was then taken by the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> as Queen Mother at the urging of Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed a lawsuit against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his company, which the court rejected today.
Clearly, Harabi’s impending swearing-in for the throne and half of the princess could bring into dispute.
A new king should come out of it.
The details and the date have not yet been revealed.
"We don't want to rush anything.
It should be something like a king's ride in Slovakia.
The king should be elected for a certain period of time.
Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can also sign up," Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> added.
Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi Test: Missing Prejudices
To be honest, I've never been too fond of the Peugeot 206.
Its driving characteristics were not much, the quality of the shifting, the control and also the production could be labeled lecqued below average.
But there is now a successor to the Peugeot 207 on the market, and it is much better.
And the van called SW goes a little further and I have no choice but to think about it.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 hatchback, I complained about the headroom in the rear seats, for example.
This is already the end of the complaint, because the body of the combi means that in this direction will not suffer even a two-meter long.
The Flight of the World
I'll go through the interior very quickly so I don't have to repeat myself too much.
It’s a rather well-designed design, where the only excuse I have is for a poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate a little more design invention, since the car already looks so elegant.
The seats are comfortable and there are times when we could complain about short seats or backrests.
Also, the lateral guidance has improved significantly against the 206 model.
As for the space, it is also here to feel the increase in the dimensions of the body.
Then the aforementioned lack of space above the head disappears in the van.
Suitcases for the suitcase
The main thing on this car is its luggage compartment.
I have to rate it as very accessible (even thanks to the pop-up rear window) and as decently stocky.
Deaf spots are equipped with retaining rubbers, which are an ideal compromise.
It does not interfere, it can be stretched and at the same time it keeps heavier objects.
But let's stand together above the waist.
According to the tables in the basic layout, this is 428 l, which is rather an average value against the competition.
But not against the best-selling car of this class in the Czech Republic - the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the young Boleslav product, then we find that Peugeot is lagging behind by a lot of noticeable 52 liters.
For a holiday abroad or when loading a stroller, this value is only critical.
But if I were to highlight the positive, I still have to mention a completely straight floor after folding the backrests of the second row or a very low threshold.
120 horses in four rows
Our tested car was equipped with a 1.6-litre four-cylinder petrol engine with an output of 88 kW.
And to be honest, this is what a 16-year-old should look like, driving a family hatchback.
It is quiet, has little consumption and, above all, pulls.
If I compare it to a pest-like look that seems to be leaking, as if it has a stuffed cloth in the exhaust, then I can only be excited about it.
The price will say
The price of the car is not popular.
However, we must keep in mind that we tested a decently equipped car with a spacious interior and a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with a 14th-century fuel cell for CZK 329,900 will still be paid.
Our unit costs from 410 900 CZK, which is quite enough.
The tested Premium equipment will then pass the equipment for another 80,000 CZK on top.
But we still had head airbags, automatic air conditioning, automatic start of wipers, electric control of the rear windows...
The car costs around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 531,900.
It’s a lot, but count the extra equipment at Fabie’s and you’ll come up with a very similar number.
All you have to do is choose a brand.
The integration of Slovak pupils in British schools is not successful
In British schools, children from Eastern European countries are growing, which in the case of local settlers raises concerns about the further development of local education.
The integration of Eastern Europeans is currently facing a number of obstacles.
British schools even register cases where disputes between immigrants and the children of the original inhabitants grow into violence.
The problem of the integration of children from Eastern Europe into British schools is well illustrated by the case in northern Kent, where disputes between local settlers and Slovak immigrants are starting to escalate.
Arguments, bullying and quarrels between students have also been transferred to relationships between parents.
The situation has gone so far that in Chatham the police have detained a Slovak woman who hit a ten-year-old pupil with an iron rod.
The defendant defends that the boy insulted her with racist insinuations.
The police had to intervene even after the attack of two teenage girls on a Slovak immigrant.
The girls allegedly honored the man with racist remarks and threw stones at him.
"As we went home, a boy climbed up to a bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to let it go, he threw apples and pears at us, and then he revealed his ass," the mother of Slovak pupils described another unpleasant incident for The Times.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the local settlers even described the dispute with immigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The above-mentioned cases indicate that the atmosphere in British schools between locals and immigrants is starting to get tense.
There are 70,000 Slovaks registered in the UK who have come here for work.
Around 30,000 Slovak pupils then attend British schools in the country.
Cuba is the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
It is truly an island of freedom for visitors.
Whatever you expect from your holiday, it can be fulfilled if you choose the right one.
Golden and white beaches, high waves, or the sea, quiet as a pond.
Palms and all inclusive with waiters offering on the beach pizza, ice cream and intoxicating cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the islands in the Caribbean Sea, you will find it in a complete and even richer list.
On just one island you will find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of the Great Antilles.
For the Spanish, Cuba was the bastion of their conquest of America.
Columbus called it the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana has become a warehouse and a repository of treasures that the Spaniards in America raided and transported to Europe.
Then came the American era.
Hotel Nacional grew up in the late 1920s.
He was let build by one of the heads of the American mafia Lucky Luciano, because everything that was a crime in the United States (especially for prohibition) was welcomed and supported in Cuba by drugs, gambling, prostitution.
Among his guests were me.
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
High-rise houses grew in Havana, and cars that belonged to the iconic symbols of the 50s of the last century ran along wide boulevards.
Ernest Hemingway bought a home in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and had his own yacht in Cojimar.
On the walls of Bodeguity del Medio, they left their signatures to showbusiness stars and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of Havana’s Bodeguita you can leave your autograph as well.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, you can mix a cocktail as you wish.
And these iconic cars from the 1950s are still driving through Havana, because once imported stamps and fiats in that salty and humid air have long since rotted.
Even though Havana, especially its oldest part, is considerably criss-crossed, there are nowhere so many beautiful colonial monuments in the area as there.
Other places are also turning into beauty, such as Trinidad.
Since tourism brings so much needed money, its development has a green one.
Over the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana, but especially in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba offers one more leaf, which is unique in the world and will be appreciated especially by train drivers.
A third of the vast plantations were transported to sugar factories by steam and motor trains.
Their car park has not been restored for many decades, so there are working machines, the levels of which are already elsewhere only in museums.
Where to go?
The most famous places most visitors to Cuba do not miss.
So there is no need to write much about Varadero or Havana.
Perhaps just to remind you that there is a museum in the already mentioned Hemingway estate and anyone who likes this writer should not miss a visit.
Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley One of the most picturesque corners of Cuba is the Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley in the west of the island.
The lush vegetation grows from the limestone substrate.
The mogotes, limestone homoles and rocks rise steeply from the bottom of the valley and in their hollows the fertile soil is captured, thanks to which the ventilated rocks are covered with dense growth.
The valley is the place where the highest quality Cuban tobacco is grown.
With its final form you can meet if you visit one of the Havana factories for the production of cigars.
It may also be interesting to know that Major Zeman's Chilean play was played there.
Trinidad
An ancient city that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
His fame and wealth brought him a trade in slaves and sugar.
Wealth has been transformed into the beauty and exhibitionism of a small town.
The colonial Spanish architecture, greatly influenced by the later French settlers, has hardly changed over the course of four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray mountains, is a place so remote that even in the 1950s there was no road connecting that region with the rest of the country.
That isolation helped him stay away.
Nothing happened there, and therefore nothing bothered, everyone was happy that he had a roof over his head.
If you have more time on Trinidad than one afternoon, then it is also worth looking at interesting places in the nearby area, such as Playa Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n beach or the Valley of the Cucrovars.
In the evening you should go to the Casa de la M<0xC3><0xBA>sica, which comes to life after dark and the music in it is quiet in the morning.
Baracoa
The town in the very east of Cuba is considered by some to be the prettiest on the island.
Indeed, such an opinion already affects the road itself.
Both roads leading from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo must cross the high and rugged mountains and pass through nature that human activity has hardly noticed.
The eastern island of Cuba has been listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site due to its unspoiled nature.
They make the best chocolate there, in the church they have the Columbus Cross (in fact it was created about a hundred years after Columbus' voyage) and from the hill where there is a former castle and today's hotel El Castillo, there are several table mountains, the most famous of which is El Yunque.
About coffee, rum, cigars, about the Sierra Maestra mountains, about the Bay of Pigs and the island of Isla de Pinos, about the cabaret of Tropicana, about the sanctuary of the Cuban patroness Caridad del Cobre, about santer<0xC3><0xAD>a, African religions, which profess the descendants of former slaves, there would be a lot to talk about.
But, as they say, it is better to see once.
U.S. allies in Afghanistan are passive, U.S. says
According to the United States, the shortage of troops and the lack of necessary equipment affect the course of the mission in Afghanistan.
According to Defense Secretary Robert Gates, NATO should plan a specific plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not going according to plan, representatives of countries that have units in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh, Scotland.
In addition to growing opposition from the Taliban movement, eight participating states are also discussing further plans and coordination of allies.
While the United States this week, through Defense Secretary Robert Gates, has called on NATO units to take greater action, the United Kingdom sees priority in strengthening the authority of the Afghan government and strengthening development assistance.
“The development in Afghanistan is tangible, but military strength can only be one part of the solution.
The next step is to enable the public to start further economic and security development on their own," Defence Secretary Des Browne told the BBC.
Ninety percent
The activity of the Afghan insurgents is the highest in the last five years, according to the US military.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to last year, in the southern province of Helmand even by 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, of which about a quarter are in southern territory.
According to the United States, however, the allies reached the same limit in the organization and equipment of the units.
Specifically, they are asking for additional helicopters, soldiers and experts for training Afghan troops.
“We’re going to have to seriously think about specific goals for the future and ways to achieve them,” Gates said.
NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I’m not happy with what we have on the ground and in the air in Afghanistan.
We have about ninety percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that’s not enough,” De Hoop told Reuters at the end of three-day talks with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
There have also been disputes among the countries involved in the past few months over whether all allies are doing their utmost in Afghanistan.
Germany, for example, has been criticised for its passivity.
“The Germans have quite a lot of representation in Afghanistan.
But they are deployed in areas where there is a minimum of violence and the fighting demands on them are not as high as on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country," Gates said.
The British tabloid Sun this week called the German soldiers lazy.
"Afghan fighters revealed: The Germans are playing while our boys are fighting," Sun wrote in the footage, supplemented by pictures of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild went on the counterattack and printed a picture of the British unit during a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
National debt to rise to a trillion in 2009
For every Czech, the national debt is more than 84,000 crowns.
Total debt rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
The government had planned to lend 159.2 billion crowns this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget management.
The national debt of the Czech Republic rose to CZK 842.7 billion at the end of September.
In nine months of this year, it increased by 40.2 billion crowns.
Since June, however, it has fallen by 13.4 billion crowns.
The Ministry of Finance has confirmed its data on the state debt since the beginning of October.
For every Czech, there is a debt of over 84,000 crowns.
During the whole of last year, the state owed more than 111 billion crowns.
"For now, it seems that due to the lower deficit for next year, we could exceed the limit of one trillion crowns only in 2009.
Next year, the debt should be between 900 billion and 1 trillion crowns," Patria Finance analyst David Marek told iHNed.cz.
Similarly, Next Finance analyst Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora sees this: "We could get to over one trillion in 2009.
When exactly will it depend on the next budget, which we do not yet know.
If it turns out that the situation on the political scene would change, politicians would be willing to save more, it could move to 2010.
But I do not anticipate this change," he said.
Debts are growing
State debt is the debt of the central government and is primarily the result of the accumulation of state budget deficits.
State debt is financed by treasury bonds, government bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The country’s domestic debt so far this year has risen by 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns.
The foreign debt of the state so far this year has increased by 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns.
The so-called marketable public debt reached CZK 803.3 billion at the end of September and has fallen by CZK 13.7 billion since June.
The average maturity of government debt has increased to 6.5 years.
“Overall debt rose 13 percent year-on-year in the first to third quarters, which is really a lot on how the economy is doing.
Interestingly, the increase is generated mainly in the case of bonds, where the increase is 20 percent.
It’s bad that debt is rising, but on the other hand, it shows that it will have something to do when there’s a pension reform,” Pikora said.
Better than expected
The strategy of financing and managing public debt for 2007 shows that the government planned to borrow CZK 159.2 billion this year.
At the beginning of December, however, the Ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to better development of the state budget management.
The amount is mainly a deficit of the state budget, which will probably reach 76 billion crowns this year instead of the expected 91.3 billion crowns.
In addition, these are the planned maximum resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency of CZK 13.3 billion, a ten-billion reserve for the payment of pensions, the financing of government bonds for CZK 43 billion and the repayment of loans from the European Investment Bank of CZK 1.8 billion.
A woman is due to appear in court in Khartoum today for giving her name to a teddy bear
A British teacher, tried in Sudan for insulting Islam, was sentenced to 15 days in prison by a Khartoum court on Thursday night and expelled, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting six to seven-year-old pupils give the teddy bear the name Mohamed despite the fact that any depiction of the Prophet of Islam is prohibited.
She was subjected to a whip wound.
This British four-and-a-half-year-old teacher, working at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested at her home on Sunday and charged with insulting Islam and rebellion, in accordance with Article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, after the parents of several students were subjected to schooling at the schools.
Our story actually begins as early as the month of September, when the teacher in question asks her six- to seven-year-old students to choose a name for a class teddy bear.
"Eight names will be heard from the children's mouths, including Hasan, Abdullah and Mohamed," said the school's principal, Robert Boulos.
After a class vote, 20 of the 23 children will eventually choose Mohamed as their favorite name.
Of course, Muhammad is the name of a Muslim prophet, but above all, it is a very widespread Christian name in Sudan.
The children then created a book for their class with a picture of a bear accompanied by the caption: "My name is Mohamed".
The bear itself did not bear a label with this name, but the difficulty lies in the depiction of the prophet himself considered an insult to Islam.
One Muslim colleague, Gillian Gibbons, who teaches at the same school in Sudan, clarified that she knows her well and that she would never do anything that could be offensive to any religious faith: "I regret only that she asked the children to vote for some 'name'," he said.
This view is shared by many of the teachers’ pupils, who describe it as “very attentive to their pupils” and add that they “never talk about religion in class”.
It should be noted that the name Mohamed is also the second most commonly given name in the UK, with English being written fourteen different ways.
This Christian name, often chosen by Muslim families, is a way to worship a prophet (often given to a firstborn).
What, though, are the rules regarding the use of this Christian name?
Is it possible to give them toys?
Of course, it's a question of interpretation.
At the last round of negotiations this Wednesday in Vienna, they did not reach an agreement on the future status of the province.
Finally, failure.
Serbs and Kosovar Albanians ended the sixth and final round of talks in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without having been able to overcome differing views on the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that both sides were unable to reach a status agreement," European negotiator Wolfgang Ischinger said during a press conference in Vienna.
His American counterpart, Frank Wisner, stressed that peace in the region is "at stake" and appealed to Belgrade and Pristina to keep their commitments to peace and to be ready for dialogue even after the end of the negotiations.
"We do not expect violence in the near future, but we are entering a difficult period," he added, adding that "it is obvious that the situation is tense".
The negotiations will end on December 10.
The Troika negotiators, made up of representatives of the European Union, the United States and Russia, will travel to Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the province, where 90 percent of the Albanian-speaking population is spoken, could be seen in a brighter light by December 10, when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian negotiator Alexander Bocan-Kharchenko are due to submit their report to the UN Security Council.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, represent the sixth and final round of negotiations since the United Nations mandated the Troika to renegotiate in August this year.
Americans and Europeans expect the talks to end on December 10.
The Russians, who have previously blocked Kosovo's independence from the UN Security Council, insist that the negotiations continue even after this deadline has been set.
"Russia has been and remains in favour of a negotiated solution, a compromise solution," Bocan-Kharchenko said.
A unilateral declaration of independence?
After eight years of governing the international community, the West considers Kosovo's independence under EU supervision to be the only viable solution.
Pristina declares that if the Security Council does not decide in its favour, it is ready to declare independence unilaterally.
Belgrade insists on extended autonomy.
"Unfortunately, we have not reached any agreement," Kosovo's President Fatmir Sejdiu said at a hotel in Baden, where the "negotiation of the last chance" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Tha<0xC3><0xA7>i, former rebel commander of the Kosovo Albanians and future prime minister of the province, expressed regret.
However, he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belongs to the past, which led to killings and deportations".
"Domination effect"
Serbian President Boris Tadi<0xC4><0x87>, on the other hand, believes that the compromise is still being considered and warned the Albanian majority in Kosovo of the consequences of the province's eventual unilaterally declared independence.
Belgrade is particularly concerned about the "dominant effect" in an area that is still unstable as a result of the wars for independence in the 1990s.
"But that does not mean for Serbia," he said, "that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation insisted that all decisions belong exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has veto power.
"Kosovo Parliament will have the last word"
"For Serbia, only a solution emanating from the Security Council is acceptable," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica said.
"This meeting lasted two years.
It must end as it began: on the ground of the Security Council."
Fatmir Sedjiu told reporters that "the last word on the status will be the Kosovo parliament" and added that if there were a unilateral declaration of independence by the Albanian-speaking population, it would take place "by agreement" with the West.
Bush has reached an agreement with the Israelis and Palestinians.
At the opening of the Annapolis, Maryland, international peace conference convened at his urging, U.S. President George Bush announced that the Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed to a joint statement.
He added that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately start negotiations with the intention of resolving the 60-year-old dispute between the two nations once and for all.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised to do everything in his power to help them conclude a “peace treaty” before the end of 2008.
Meanwhile, the Palestinians must destroy “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end colonial activities, Bush said, recalling the obligations that flow to both sides from the “road map” to the peace they adopted in 2003.
The head of the White House stressed that the negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority led by Abbas are aimed "at concluding a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues without exception, including central issues."
This declaration includes three issues that are at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem, and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes in what is now Israel in 1948.
Abbas said he would take the floor after the U.S. president, stressing that the subsequent talks would be “total and thorough” and that it would touch on all aspects of the solution, mentioning “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things.”
Olmert then addressed the tribune, who expressed the view that the subsequent negotiations should be "direct and continuous" and that it should be "beginning to be concluded in the course of 2008".
Bush set the end of 2008 as the date for his “visa of two states”, Palestinian and Israeli, existing side by side.
Saudi Arabia has revealed that it made a commitment to this effect from Bush even before it decided to attend the conference.
Saudi Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, initiated a proposal adopted by all Arab countries that offers peace to Israel in exchange for leaving all Arab territories seized during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis means "a crossroads in the history of the Middle East especially because it fights against the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in an interview he gave to an Arabic-speaking newspaper shielded by Saudi capital.
According to the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened on Sunday?
As is always the case with such small news from the black chronicle, the official versions do not agree with what is said between people.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first results of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the French State Police (Inspection générale de la police nationale, IGPN), a police car drove through the Rue Louise-Michel in the village of Villiers-le-Bel on Sunday shortly after 5 p.m.
"The vehicle was not in the intervention mode, but was on patrol and was travelling at speeds of 40 to 50 km/h, while no side lights were on," a police source explained.
Kawasaki's green motorcycle, "unregistered and therefore not allowed to ride on public transport" (read below), driven by two young men without a helmet, was driven "at a very high speed".
"The motorcycle hit the police car from the left after not giving preference to the right," one police officer said.
The blood alcohol test carried out on the vehicle crew was negative.
The condition of the car (punched forefoot, shattered windshield, broken bumpers) testifies to the severity of the impact.
The public prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise (République de Pontoise) Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se de Givry responded very quickly and announced yesterday morning that the IGPN had commissioned an investigation into "the acts of unintentional killing and non-assistance to persons in danger", whose de départée de Vald<0xC3><0xA8>re is also taking the direction of the département.
On the occasion of the afternoon press conference, the prosecutor stated that the investigation conducted by the IGPN excludes, at this stage, the responsibility of the police officers for the accident.
According to the official, three witnesses who were questioned on Sunday evening confirmed "the version of the police officers, namely that the mini-motor approached them relatively quickly from the left".
A ridge, undoubtedly caused by the friction of the clips on the ground, showed yesterday that both vehicles remained stuck until the moment when the police car was able to brake.
The vehicles have been secured and will pass through technical expertise.
There was an autopsy on the bodies of both victims yesterday.
What happened, right after that?
Yesterday, in Villiers-le-Bel, there was a rapid increase in talk among people that police officers should quickly leave the scene of the crime without providing first aid to the two young men.
The IGPN should also, with all due care, rule out “any serious wrongdoing” at this point.
"This is a more demanding aspect of the investigation, which requires more investigation and with which you need to be very careful," a police source said.
The newspaper "Libération" met with an eyewitness of the few moments that followed the accident.
One of his windows leads directly to where the accident took place.
"Immediately, together with my cousin, who is a nurse in the hospital, we ran down to try to resurrect them," the witness said.
I couldn't do anything."
Then he saw a laughing, completely frightened policeman.
Two others tried to resurrect one of the young men and the fourth spoke on the phone.
Faced with the rapidly rising tensions and the certainty of the young people’s hopeless situation, police officers were taken by car to their colleagues who had arrived at the scene.
According to the same witness, the ambulance arrived "about twenty minutes after the officers left".
They also performed a heart massage, but in vain.
"Let no one claim that the police authorities did not rush to help the young people.
These young people were given first aid.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything was done to save them," the prosecutor said.
Tensions are rising in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday suppressed the first demonstration since General Musharraf declared a state of emergency two days earlier.
In the eastern city of Lahore, about 2,000 lawyers demonstrating against the measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by tear gas grenades, which witnesses say were used by law enforcement.
The last-named men responded with stones, injuring several police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been summoned.
Similar scenarios as in Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers attacked and injured lawyers.
Several of them should have been called.
In Islamabad, the lawyers of the Supreme Court called for a general strike and announced the demonstrations, as a result of a wave of about five hundred arrests of opponents, human rights fighters and lawyers over the weekend.
Access streets to the Supreme Court were reopened on Monday morning to prevent the gathering from taking place.
Further demonstrations were to take place in Multan (centre) and in Peshawar (north-west).
On Monday, the lawyers’ movement gained the support of religious parties grouped in a politically powerful alliance called Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal, whose president “invited the population to send flowers to judges who opposed the state of emergency, and waste to those who faced Musharraf.”
"Musharraf's promise is not true"
Pakistan’s Supreme Court is the direct target of an extraordinary measure announced on Saturday evening.
In the coming days, the legality of the re-election of President Musharraf in an indirect presidential election, which took place on 6 October, was to be expressed.
Iftikhar court president Mohammad Chaudhry was removed and replaced.
“Everything we are witnessing is illegal, unconstitutional and against the rulings of the Supreme Court,” the official told The News.
Musharraf's promise to give up his military leadership and become a civilian president "does not apply" after the state of emergency was imposed, Deputy Information Minister Tariq Azeem said on Monday.
He was expected to give up his military uniform until 15 November, when his first presidential term ended.
The Deputy Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
The Pakistani government has also refuted ongoing speculation in the country that a deputy army chief was to order President Musharraf's home detention.
More than a third of pregnancies still constitute an unexpected pregnancy.
This figure includes pregnancies that are unwanted (24%), as well as poorly planned or that occur in an unexpected way.
More than one in three pregnancies (36%) is still unexpected today, according to a study led by the French Institut national d'études démographiques (Ined) - the State Institute for Demographic Studies, forty years after the adoption of the so-called Neuwirth Act, which legalized contraception in France.
This figure includes pregnancies that are unwanted (24%), as well as poorly planned or that occur in an unexpected way.
Various methods of contraception, such as hormonal contraception or sterilization, still show a 5% to 6% failure rate, Ined estimates.
After all, the legalization of contraception has allowed for better "fertility control", the institute says, noting that the rate of hormonal contraceptive use in women between the ages of 20 and 44, from 5% in 1970, has now reached 60%.
Finally, eight out of ten births today are well planned.
One in five couples even have a birth calculated for a month exactly and if possible in the spring, which is considered the most pleasant period of the year for the birth of a child.
Remarkable repair of the space station
For more than seven hours of space work, astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crew from the International Space Station (ISS) needed a remarkable repair of the torn solar panel necessary for the station’s further scientific activity.
It was a risky ascent into space, which collected records in terms of duration, distance from residential modules, the speed at which it was planned, and the levels of "caution" that astronauts spent on repair.
Problems surfaced on Tuesday as the Discovery astronauts laid out the Harmony module, a large cylindrical body designed to install a European and Japanese science lab (see box).
This module is kind of a landing dock for lab modules.
They need to be able to supply electricity.
The crew’s second task, therefore, was to move the seventeen-and-a-half-ton power-generating module using solar panels already on the ISS to anchor at its final site.
After repositioning it, the crew began to disassemble the module's 70-foot solar panels.
And in it, one of the panels, unfolding like a pulling accordion, as a result of the tightening of the cable, was damaged on an area of almost one meter.
Deployment has been suspended to prevent further damage to the panel.
Astronauts, who were originally supposed to perform a control exit on the Discovery ship, and then go to repair another solar panel, whose rotation system had a malfunction, were forced to devote themselves to the damaged panel.
And it was Scott Parazynski who was chosen to fly to the end of the robotic arm of the ship, attached to the station's shoulder, and performed the repair.
It is one of the best spacewalkers of the U.S. Air and Space Administration (NASA).
Tall, sturdy, very agile, has a very elaborate chest and long arms.
At the age of 46, this original job was entrusted to the doctor to "operate" the "injured" solar panel.
After thoroughly examining the damage, he cut off the faulty cable and fixed some "thread" on the damaged places.
He was helped by a second spacewalker, who remained close to the alignment chamber, and also from inside, by other astronauts, including Peggy Witson, the crew commander.
The tools he used, a mini-hockey fitted with an insulating means to prevent electric shock on solar panels producing several hundred volts, were invented and "after the cut" made by astronauts on board the station.
After the operation, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully unfolded and then re-assessed his tools and returned to the inner part of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts were enjoying a half-day rest before today, when the seven astronauts return to the ship Discovery to return to Earth on Wednesday, as planned.
EADS shares are weakening
EADS shares are losing significantly on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the airline, which operates in the aviation and defense industry, announced that it will have to spend 1.2 to 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delay of the A400M aircraft.
EADS lost 4% and is now listed on the Paris Stock Exchange for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21.96.
The financial group was forced to reassess its forecast production results for 2007 as a result of delays resulting from the slow progress of the development of the A400M engine, which is a condition of the take-off flight.
The price for the easing of delays in the delivery of military cargo aircraft, announced in October, was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.2 billion to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.4 billion, of which more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1 billion for Airbus, the parent company of the European constructor EADS announced.
Due to these costs, EADS will be forced to announce a new profit outlook before interest and tax deductions (EBIT) next Thursday when it presents its quarterly results.
The group also revealed that the new cost estimate corresponds to a six-month delay.
Recall that in 2006 EADS’ production performance fell by 86 %, mainly due to the costs associated with the delay of another programme, namely the giant A380.
Initially, the group assumed that the first delivery of the A400M aircraft to the French Army would be provided in October 2009.
Decision on the status quo
Sunday’s election will take place without high expectations: the Russians will choose the side of President Putin, United Russia.
Confirming this, after the end of the very few free pre-election campaigns, their drive for stability, even authoritarianism.
Today, three days before the elections to the Chamber of Deputies, Russian President Vladimir Putin will announce to voters on public law stations a televised message, the content of which is kept secret.
He does so from the position of leader of United Russia, a pro-Kremlin party that seems to be celebrating a crushing victory.
When he received the ambassadors of foreign states yesterday, the president left nothing out of him and contented himself with another attack on the West accused of meddling - his favorite topic during the campaign.
“We know the price of true democracy and we wish for honest, as transparent and open as possible elections, elections without the slightest defect in beauty,” he added.
In the eyes of the opposition, this is far from the case.
They condemn a campaign marked by various pressures.
Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov says that "there have never been such dirty elections, not even under Yeltsin."
After the repressions of last weekend’s demonstrations, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for an illegal demonstration, continues to be banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians have a homo sovietica mentality."
Against the background of these Parliamentary elections, two far more open questions are outlined:
Who will be Putin’s successor in office?
The official gazette yesterday published the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates can present themselves to the public until December 23.
Vladimir Putin, elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, cannot seek a third consecutive term.
However, no follower appears.
"What role will Putin play after March?"
Will he be Prime Minister?
Or the head of the parliamentary majority and the all-powerful party United Russia, which chooses the government and the president?
Either way, the outgoing ruling power will win the entire line in parliamentary as well as presidential elections.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians have remained homo sovitica mentality, they do not feel they are masters of their destiny," says sociologist Lev Gudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
Historian Nikolai Kopossov of the State University of St. Petersburg observes a more distant context: civil society has acquired, in this country Christianized five centuries after Europe, a delay; that famous common spirit has delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Putin followed a paternalistic model of the state, perfectly accepted by the population, rather than terror, but a certain economic prosperity," believes Maria Lipman of the Carnegie Foundation.
The Russians today "voluntarily give up personal responsibility", which they demonstrated shortly after the collapse of the USSR.
"Why think?"
This phenomenon affects all social strata, including the business world.
The official elite also intends to maintain the status quo: 65 governors (out of a total of 85 heads of Russian regions) manage the local candidates of the United Russia.
The new freedoms taken from the West are often, as in the 1990s, synonymous with chaos.
Public opinion prefers stability.
Also, in the name of stability, the Russians will not vote for extremists.
The conclusion of Tamara Cherednichenko, a fifty-four-year-old professor: "What to think?
Those in power aren’t so bad, so why change them?”
Loaded memory
After more than sixty years in a confidential regime, the Nazi archives in Bad Arolsen, which account for the fate of 17.5 million victims of Hitler’s regime, are opening up to the public.
The 47 million archival documents stored at 27 km in Bad Arolsen (Hesse) have so far been accessible only for "humanitarian" purposes, that is, individually and nominally, at the request of the former victim or her authorized persons.
The 11 countries responsible for managing the archives – including Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May to open them to scientists and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all states is at an end, yesterday's opening took effect.
Sensitive Information
The free access of historians to Bad Arolsen will make it possible to investigate "especially the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced labourers", explains Reto Meistern, director of these archives managed by the International Committee of the Red Cross (Comité international de la Croix-rouge, <0xC3><0x89>tat international de la Croix-CI).
Until recently, several states, including Germany, were opposed to making these named documents available to the public because of the sensitive nature of some information.
What are the presumed homosexuality or mental disabilities of some of the victims of deportation?
After the war, the registers of concentration camps or inmates compiled by the Gestapo were collected for the practical purpose of finding deported or forced labour subject to civilians, bringing them proof of their internment in order to open the way for their compensation.
To date, more than 300 permanent employees in Bad Arolsen deal with tens of thousands of individual applications.
However, for part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is only a limited benefit.
"Nothing fundamentally new can be expected from these documents," said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Center for the Study of Anti-Semitism at Berlin's Technische Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t in 2006.
The EU and India want to achieve free trade agreements in 2008
At present, bilateral trade between Europe and India already amounts to almost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion a year.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect a free trade agreement to be signed in 2008, European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart Kamal Nath have said.
In April last year, EU foreign ministers gave the green European Commission to start negotiations with a view to signing the free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Bilateral trade between India and Europe is already reaching 60 billion.
The EU is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The EU is also its first foreign investor, but India is, according to the European Commission, the EU’s ninth trading partner.
"The free trade agreement is hugely complementary to both economies" and "India will gain better access to the market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, the President of the European Commission, the President of the European Commission, the President of the European Commission, the President of the European Commission. The Asian and European giants together turn "47 billion euros in goods" and "ten billion euros in services", said this week Dani<0xC3><0xA8>le Smadja, the head of the delegation of the European Commission.

The Bank of England took note of the concerns and offered <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion in a five-week auction
The Bank of England announced on Thursday that it intends to ease current concerns that conditions in the credit market will worsen again and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10bn bid in a five-week auction at a base interest rate of 5.75%, an offer that has been unusually long in force.
"In an effort to alleviate concerns that conditions on financial markets will be very adverse at the end of the year and give banks greater certainty on how to secure their cash position for this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant portion of its planned reserve during the maintenance period, which will begin on 6 December," the Bank said in a statement.
The Bank states that <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) will be placed on the financial market on 6 December at 12.15 GMT until 10 January, at the base interest rate.
This seems to be the first time BOE has pumped cash into the financial market in a five-week open market operation.
They usually last a week.
The BOE said in a statement that it “remains prepared to take further measures to keep interest rates on interbank loans at the same level as their base rate on an ongoing basis.”
The interbank interest rate on Wednesday was 5.829 %.
The three-month interest rate has settled at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the beginning of the summer financial crisis, the sums placed on the financial market by the Bank of England have been linked to the tax rates which have prevented the banks from making use of this offer.
According to certain speculations reinforced by the development of the pound against the euro, many preferred to opt for sums placed on the financial market by the European Central Bank with lower rates and more discreet guarantees.
UMP (Union pour un mouvement populaire, Union pour un mouvement populaire) and NC (Nouveau Centre, Nov<0xC3><0xBD> centr) refuse to address Socialist (PS) proposals on purchasing power
The UMP and Nouveau Centre on Thursday refused to discuss the individual paragraphs of the socialist draft law on purchasing power, which is tantamount to rejecting the text.
On the agenda of the day, the text of the draft law was received within the framework of the so-called socialist "nest" (a meeting initiated by the individual parliamentary club) and contained a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the PS presidency, among which was an increase in the employment premium by 50%, the renewal of the fluctuating TIPP regulations, and the cleaning of the roads.
Since the UMP and NC voted against the discussion of the individual paragraphs (180 votes to 115), the session ended after a general debate, which became an opportunity for an exchange of views, sometimes more lively, between the majority and the opposition, a few hours before the televised speech on Nicolas Sarkozy.
PS leader Jean-Marc Ayrault announced that his club will resubmit these proposals in their entirety in the form of additions to the proposed amendment to the Finance Act, which will be debated by the House next week.
A new festival is born
As a result of many speculations that C3 Presents in Philadelphia is setting up a new festival, this promoter/producer announced the Vineland Festival in New Jersey in collaboration with Melvin Benn’s Festival Republic.
“It’s an honor for our company to work with a man who has inspired the current festival movement in America without exaggeration,” said Charlie Jones of C3 on Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza and Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is the summer destination for campers.
The festival is scheduled to take place from August 8 to 10 on a 500-acre private farm, about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
The Director of the Republic Festival, formerly known as Mean Fiddler, is one of the world’s most respected festival organizers.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts 80,000 people each year.
In 1999, he added Melvin Benn to his Leeds Festival portfolio, and in 2006, Festival Republic founded the Latitude Festival in Henham Park, Suffolk.
As of 2002, Melvin Benn, as co-owner, is also in charge of production, licensing and organizing duties at the Glastonbury Festival, which now has a capacity of up to 177,500 people.
Charlie Jones of C3 describes Glastonbury as "the most inspiring event" he has ever experienced and says his company and Melvina Benna are working together to give the region a European-style festival event.
“Originally, we chose Philadelphia as our market and, together with the Fairmount Parks Commission, we worked hard to establish a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
"I worked with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about the project.
Unfortunately, however, due to the current leadership of the city, we have moved into politics, adds Charlie Jones.
"Fortunately, we had the opportunity to discuss with Melvin Benn and we are going to establish a great festival in an exceptional place that will ultimately serve the people of Philadelphia."
C3 Presents revived the Lollapalooza Festival in 2005 at Grant Park, Chicago, after excelling on the festival stage with the Austin City Limits Music Festival in 2002.
Gross sales of both events for 2007 were $9.8M and $11.3M.
Both of these festivals take place in the urban environment.
“The European model of Melvin Benn’s festival takes place in the countryside, while our festivals take place in green spaces in cities,” says Charlie Jones.
Our aim is to combine the two concepts in a certain way in order to create the impression of both a rural festival in Europe and an urban festival in America."
Vineland is located about halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, is excited to support this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to disclose the terms of the deal, but says they are "beneficial enough to allow for investment in such an event and to welcome a festival that will, hopefully, last a long time".
Charlie Jones says the festival’s capacity is “very high,” similar to the capacity of the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee, which will hold 80,000 people.
He says that invitations have already been sent to the groups, but nothing can yet be confirmed when the program is just put into print.
“Vineland will have a rock vibe, but the music there will be varied to attract a wide range of audiences if possible,” says Carlie Jones.
C3’s partners, who received the Top Independent Promoter award in the last year of the Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal facing the Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood film studios to Montreal when Terminator...
This mission of persuasion is one of the tasks of the delegate.
However, his mandate is "politically demanding" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger condemns "runaway productions".
Is it difficult to fall into the "Governor's" claws??
"You have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where they go.
If he finds the conditions in Montreal favorable, he'll go there.
Our job is to offer the ones they think are the best," he said.
Hunting for festivals
For now, however, Denise Turcotte's priority is promoting the local film.
The hunt for the Oscars has already begun.
At all West Coast festivals, whether in Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, it will be about introducing Quebec films, bringing them to the attention and ensuring that directors provide interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good publicity at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake hands with the Devil is on offer in Santa Monica and will be presented in November at the 30th edition of the Starz Denver Film Festival.
This month, Quebec also presented four short films and four feature films at the American Film Institute Fest.
Will there be a marathon at the end of the year on the stock exchange? Experts divided the 'subprime' crisis
Less than five weeks remain until the end of the administrative year and investors are already holding my hand in the expectation that there will be a traditional marathon at the end of the year.
This year, however, experts are not so sure that it will happen.
Banif Bank believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December has a positive course on the stock exchange".
However, it is not appropriate to make predictions solely on the basis of statistics, in particular because, in the current context, markets give, at least in the short term, certain doubts.
These experts do not assume that the stock market has fluctuated in recent weeks of the year, stating that "the stock market maintains the existence of liquidity, which is ready to invest due to the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed income affected by the effect of the turnaround to high-quality securities, as well as the stock market.
Therefore, they believe that the stock market will have a rather calm course, not without volatility, "especially since the impact of the likely collapse of the Fed (Federal Reserve System) rates is not known, given the high level of oil prices and the danger of stimulus to inflationary pressures".
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that this is not the right time for a bold statement that there will be a marathon.
"There's not much reason to be happy," the expert assures.
Ibex lost almost 4% of the maximum values recorded on November 8, when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
However, not all experts have such a negative opinion.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could end the year slightly closer to 16,000 points thanks to the regrouping of portfolios and traditional pension contributions that take place every year at this time.
However, this expert suggests that this year everything will be a little different, because he believes that the marathon will take place earlier, in the second week of December after the extended weekend on the occasion of Constitution Day.
This analyst does not believe that volatility would affect the direction of the market.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, also estimates that we are approaching a technical level and "that's why we could observe a reflection of the index, triggered by reports from the US on the consequences of the crisis on the credit market".
Analysts believe that these consequences will be positive.
Analysts agree on the choice of titles that will make sure to bring Ibex to new maximum odds.
Solana from Intermoney confirms that "this year is the year for strong titles".
This expert would include both large banks and some construction companies in the portfolio, "because when this period comes, the energy sector will be very expensive."
Federico Olucha of Inversis Banco, on the other hand, assures that the increases will go hand in hand with the banking and industrial sectors.
Construction companies will also be able to get rich on this marathon if it happens.
"ACS has been resuming its position for several months now and we hope that other construction companies, such as Ferrovial and FCC, will follow the same path," the expert explains.
The cyclical consumption will be in the foreground in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales during the Christmas sales period.
This expert, on the other hand, believes that the technology will also perform very well, although in this field they are not too represented in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a month of decline in only two cases.
The real marathon at the end of the year took place in 2003, in the administrative year when stock markets ended the crisis caused by the collapse of the technological bubble.
This year, when Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December saw an increase of 6.68%.
We will see if 2007 will be the fifth year of profit (so far, Ibex has increased by 8.36% since January) and if it will manage to have its marathon at the end of the year.
Two hundred branches of Popular Bank will be open 12 hours from Friday to Saturday
Banka Popular has decided to modernize most of its branches.
A total of two hundred, located in the most commercial parts of Spain.
These branches operated under the Popular Max brand are a big change for the bank.
Likewise for other Spanish entities, since it is the first group that decided to make such a jump and bet on the continuous opening hours of its branches until 20.30 and open on Saturdays from 10 to 20.30.
BBVA, another group that has also repeatedly assured that it wants to extend the opening hours of its branches, has not yet decided on this step.
In the meantime, it intends to conclude an agreement with the trade unions to cancel the opening hours of 75% of its branches on Saturday in exchange for an extension of the opening hours by one afternoon, albeit not for the public.
The results of this experience of Popular Bank will be decisive for other entities to join or not to join this initiative, which supports the opening hours of trades.
This is exactly the goal of the project that Popular Bank has set itself.
Obtain individual clients who go to these places for their purchases, small and medium-sized companies, tradesmen and shops from selected streets, where the branches will be opened.
The bank wants to open 200 of these branches throughout Spain in about 18 months, as it is not about opening new branches, but only about adjusting existing ones.
For this reason, the bank will modernize the branches that it already has in the business zones by adapting them to the profile of clients in the individual streets.
This prolongation of the opening hours is complemented by a different concept of the branch space and a new, more up-to-date design in lighter colors.
<0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, managing director of the bank, said that this restructuring will not mean a large investment, but a larger recruitment of staff, as it moves from six employees to a branch to eight to nine.
The branches will even be equipped with meeting rooms for small and medium-sized companies and will also sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group.
Banka Popular has already tested this initiative in three Madrid branches.
And it was a positive experience, as <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera explains.
Branches were chosen in Madrid's streets of Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a, and according to Rivera, it seems to have been a happy choice.
Banka Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And the other 60 specializing in immigrants, which are operated under the Mundocredit brand, also has a very long opening time and is open even on Sundays and holidays.
PopularMax branches will not follow the BBVA model, where a number of its branches offer a wide range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our clients,” Rivera said.
They have just agreed with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica to sell their phones through external staff.
Telecinco doubles the value of its rival Antenna 3 for the first time on the stock exchange
We've done it.
Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, expressed his satisfaction at the conclusion of the trade yesterday, when he stated that the television he runs has doubled the value of its rival Antenna 3.
Only one thing spoiled his joy: 'What I'm sorry about is that it didn't happen because we grew more, but because we fell less,' he said.
And yet he stressed that thanks to the weak market, 'we have fallen less'.
Telecinco ended its trade yesterday by a 2.54% increase.
This profit moved their loss over the past half of the year to 15.66%.
The exchange value of this company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% capital) with the participation of Vocent (another 13%) thus, according to Bloomberg data, reaches 4 488.88 million euros.
Its competitor, Antena 3, which fell 1.52% yesterday and dropped 40.5% overall since January, has a half-life of $2,193.46 million.
The value of the other telecommunications companies that have been evaluated is 3.571 billion in the case of Sogecable, 2,518.53 million Prisa (publisher Cinco D<0xC3><0xAD>as) and 1.779 billion Vocento.
According to Vasile, comparison with Antenna 3 is offered, since 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do it in the same market, at what price, and how we evaluate it in terms of tracking.”
Telecinco announced last week that it expects this year to become the first TV channel to surpass billions of gross ad revenue, as assured by Giuseppe Tringali, CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, a branch that provides advertising for the group.
If the forecast were actually achieved, this TV channel would see an increase in ad revenue of 3.6% this year compared to 965.4 million in 2006.
At the same time, in the first nine months of the year, the net turnover of Antenna 3 increased by 1.6% (to reach 734.4 million), while the net income of this TV increased by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts are focusing on for the best relative development of Telecinco on the stock exchange is the increased pay out that has so far remained: in 2006, this company, chaired by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, divided among its shareholders 100% of its profits.
Vasile assures that although it is early to make a decision, this coefficient could change after the purchase of 33% of Endemol together with its parent company Mediaset.
"We have an official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always announced much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to satisfy our shareholders, who have already raised the value of 33% of Endemola’.
According to analysts, the market is showing some fatigue at the moment.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its estimates of Telecinco’s profit by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
This is because, they explain, the projected revenue growth stopped from 0.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
The company also reduced its forecast earnings for Antena 3 by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves MiFID roll-out effective November 1
Concurrent with the parliamentary negotiations that ended today with a vote in Congress on the Senate's amendments to the bill, the government has submitted to a public hearing the regulations that are developing the new law, with the aim of both coming into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the parties unanimously highlighted the efforts of Members and Senators to negotiate and agree on the best standard to guarantee the protection of investors and the detailed regulation of the activities of entities necessary for the effective functioning of the markets.
The MiFID Directive, which regulates the Securities Trading Act, provides for the modernisation of financial markets and at the same time strengthens investor protection, improves the supervisory powers of the State Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and promotes cooperation between the individual supervisory authorities of the European Union.
This new regulation will enable financial advisory services to be provided to both specialised companies and natural or legal persons, and will create a new type of financial service provider (ESIS), financial advisory company (AFI), which join companies with securities, brokerages and brokerages.
In addition, the number of systems for performing operations with financial instruments is being expanded by adding multilateral trading systems and order internalisation systems to regulated secondary markets, which will compete with current stockbrokers.
The law further obliges investment service providers to disseminate on the market information on key aspects of their business profile, exposure to risk and ways of coping with risk, and requires them to keep a record of all the operations carried out to simplify supervision by CNMV.
During the discussion in the Congressional Trade Commission, several amendments were included, among which stand out the fact that securitised receivables were considered a "complex" financial instrument due to the high risk to the investor, which was demonstrated by what occurred in the US with high-risk mortgages.
In addition, the transposition of the Directive has been used to legally determine the functions that can be held by bachelors in the field of economics and business management 30 years after the Royal Decree, which specifies professional functions reserved for economists, was approved in 1977.
At the same time, the Senate has included the creation of new professions in the financial sector, such as an intermediary who will work externally, will not require permission from CNMV and will be able to provide product trading and client acquisition services for various investment firms at the same time.
Harmonised ISC increased by five tenths to 4.1% in November
This indicator, later used by Eurostat to calculate the inflation index of the European Union, provides preliminary information on how prices developed in Spain during the month of November.
Its publication corresponds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (CEB) to provide data in a time and quality comparable to those achieved in the United States.
This preliminary indicator is calculated using the same process as used for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices, but using different statistical modelling methods to estimate information that is not yet available at the time of publication.
The Spanish INE (National Institute of Statistics) recalled that the information provided by this preliminary indicator is only indicative and therefore does not necessarily coincide with the final data, which will be announced on 14 December this year.
"The ISC will continue to be maintained at a relatively high level"
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Economy Pedro Solbes said that the November increase in the ISC to 4.1% is "a temporary number", but at the same time predicted that the price index will continue to be at a relatively "high level" in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes clarified in the round-tables of Congress that "although it will not be a favorable number", Spain's inflation differential against the monetary union is still "more or less" the same in the last two years.
He also explained that November "was less surprising" than the previous month, when the government did not expect such a high increase.
"We expected a value of around 4%," the economy minister said in a statement.
Virgin plans to make <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion from Northern Rock in three years
Since Northern Rock went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England, its deposits have fallen by more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (16.8 billion euros).
The bank then managed record deposits worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, which gradually declined over the course of two and a half months, despite the government offering a 100% guarantee on the money and extending it until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which will replace the entity’s name with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to raise around a quarter of the revenue invested in UK banks over the next three years to raise the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion to reach the <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion target.
The group of tycoon Richard Branson, known in the UK for its prominent advertising campaigns, plans to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) a year on advertising and marketing to achieve its goal.
Northern Rock Bank this week marked the Virgin consortium’s offer, which consists of three other companies, such as the one that prefer to save them from bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana Arrested for Alleged Corruption Practices in Construction
The Civil Guard arrested the current mayor of the town of Totana (from the People's Party) in the early hours of today due to his alleged involvement in the corruption practices during construction, which were revealed this week.
One of the town hall’s secretaries and the head of the local police was also arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo replaced in May this year Juan Morales, the current People’s Deputy and until then the mayor of the municipality, who according to investigative sources addressed by Cadena TV SER, could be the ‘head’ of the whole enterprise.
Police continue to monitor the town hall buildings and the construction commission and do not rule out further arrests in the coming hours.
In addition, lawyer Juan Morales, the main suspect in corruption practices during construction, was charged, which were revealed earlier this week.
As reported yesterday by Cadena SER, the lawyer of the 'humane' MP Juan Morales, who was being investigated, was arrested on leaving Morales' residence with important documents related to corruption.
According to sources, Morales is also being investigated for allegedly collecting commissions for his signing of a construction agreement with a Galician construction company, which has requalified 200 hectares of land.
Eight people are currently detained.
Bono accepted the offer to lead the Toledo candidate PSOE and, if they win, the president of Congress
Former Defense Minister José Bono accepted the offer of Prime Minister and General Secretary of the Socialists José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero to stand in the next general election at the head of the PSOE (Spanish Workers' Socialist Party) candidate list in Toledo and in the event that the Socialists were elected by all parties.
This was announced at a press conference by the secretary of the PSOE for the organization José Blanco and Bono himself, after a meeting with Zapatero, which took place this afternoon in the federal headquarters of the party.
The chief executive justified the offer to the former minister by saying that in political life "it is important to count on the best" and Bono "is among the best".
He further noted that "yes, it seems" that this politician from La Mancha will be a candidate of the Socialist Party for the presidency of Congress if the Socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n, who announced on November 15 his decision not to run in the next general election and to leave his active political career in order to devote himself to the fight against climate change within university education.
The former minister admitted that the prime minister had repeatedly urged him to return to the top policy he had abandoned two years ago.
He also said that just as citizens know who will be deputy economy minister if the PSOE wins the election, his party wanted to announce in a "transparent form" who will be the president of Congress.
If Bono gets this job, he hopes to turn the House into a "house of respect, not bribery or yelling" and make it "more and more like citizens".
Unfortunately, at times it seems that the only place in Madrid where it is not possible to speak in peace and quiet is the Congress, the Prime Minister of the Senate was interrupted on one occasion 26 times.
Likewise, he made laudatory remarks at the address of current President Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n and "his good work" and did not want to imagine himself in his place, so as not to be reduced to what his opponents might consider "gloriousness".
Climate Propaganda
Given that the climate change movement is being relentlessly persecuted by both those who are skeptical of its predictions and those who prefer other political and social struggles, they must show firm cohesion.
Moreover, the leader of a movement that is prime minister like Zapatero and believes that this fight is more important than the fight against Islamic terrorism and even intends to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This proposal forces him to explain why his government's actions or inaction have contributed significantly to Spain's leadership in the European Union in breach of the Kyoto Protocol.
Who is responsible for this non-fulfilment, in what sectors this is happening and why his government, the government of the treaty, has not prevented it.
In addition, this forces him to explain as clearly as possible to the Spaniards what measures he intends to take to discourage climate change.
Which companies will be damaged, which habits of the population will have to be changed, what energy savings, individual and collective, we will have to accept and what will have economic consequences.
In other words, who sacrifices himself and who pays for saving the planet.
But we have not, and we will not, wait for such an explanation.
It’s because you have to sacrifice and pay.
Measures against climate change, real measures, are unpopular.
Expensive, inconvenient and threatening corporate and private accounts.
Even one cent of the price of gasoline, proposed by the PSOE (Spanish Workers’ Socialist Party), seemed so risky to Zapatero in terms of elections that he rushed to reject it.
In other words, it is about saving the planet so that it costs nothing, pure propaganda, passwords lacking any real meaning.
Active phrases, committees, committees, protocols, and new posts.
And by contracts with the planet; this gentleman so useful for election campaigns, who does not even speak, does not accuse, does not demand anything, but is the ornament of meetings and arouses tenderness.
If it is limited to being a virtual contracting party and does not ask us to ride a bike and cool with a fan.
Mayor and local police chief Totana arrested on suspicion of corrupt practices during construction
According to investigative sources, the Civil Guard arrested the mayor of the city of Totana, the “people’s man” José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the town hall and one businessman in the hospitality industry, for suspicion of committing crimes during construction.
The mayor was arrested at his residence and transferred to the town hall, in whose premises he is now located, along with a number of police officers who have also arrived at the Commission for Construction and the Municipal Enterprise for the Management of Industrial Lands and Apartments.
These three arrests added to the six that took place last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, during an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of agricultural land to land suitable for construction, so that the Galician company Nuaria, after paying illegal commissions, could build houses in the course of the period.
In addition, two other people have not been arrested, but are accused in a shortened trial in the court of the first instance of the city of Totana.
The first six arrests were handed over to the court today.
According to information sources, the former mayor of Totana and now a member of the autonomous parliament for the People's Party (PP), Juan Morales, are under investigation.
In addition, his former wife, the owner of a real estate office, registered today in Totana, and also his current girlfriend, who lives in Murcia, the capital of the autonomous region.
Manuel N. A., director and owner of the Nuaria group, lawyer and businessman from Vigo, was arrested in Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra province), as well as Pablo José M. G., director of the Suelo de Inmonuar company, which belongs to that group and through which bribes were handed over.
The investigation is carried out by a group for crimes in the construction of the Civil Guard’s central operational unit, whose members, in addition to arrests, also carried out eleven inspections, mostly in companies related to the detainees, with headquarters in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid province) and Tota<0xC5><0x88>.
At that time, only one person was imprisoned in Totana, a well-known owner of the company for poultry products, who could serve as an intermediary.
Nuaria Group was commissioned to build the largest residential complex in the Murcian city of Totana, which would represent the construction of more than 5,000 houses, a golf course and two hotels with a "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana, which was re-qualified and its project was to double the settlement of the village, which has a population of 25,000.
Nuaria Group consists of companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, which are dedicated to the promotion of the real estate market, Conycase, which manages parking in the streets of Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and on the square Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico in the city of Vigo, Hogartel, which is dedicated to direct marketing and Preconiza, which is focused on the sale, the construction, the construction and the construction.

Our Finnish correspondent sends us this comment from yesterday’s edition of the most important Finnish newspaper Helsingin Sanomat (by the way, at the beginning of the PISA report on the level of education in the world), which refers to what the newspaper printed on November 18th, on the same day as the criticism of the newspapers.
"The content of the subject of philosophy has penetrated into public discussions in connection with the tragedy at the school in Jokela.
The victim's killer, a high school student, quoted the works of Plato and Nietzsche in his messages.
Pekka Elo, the councilor for education responsible for the subject of philosophy, demanded on the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that professors take a critical view of Plato and argued that it is not necessary to discuss Nietzsche in the compulsory basic course of philosophy in secondary schools.

One colleague informs about the introduction of the crime of downloading from the Internet into the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading one song would be a criminal offence with a rate of six months to one year.
On the other hand, if you sell boards in the store for less than 400 euros, this is considered a mere infringement (<0xC2><0xA7> 623.1).
B. If you steal up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,000 in a shop, theft is already a criminal offence, but the penalty is lower than for downloading (Section 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it after 40 hours, the penalty is still lower than for downloading (<0xC2><0xA7> 244.1)
D. It is less serious to take part in a fight than to change the compacts.
Participating in the riot has a rate from three months to one year (<0xC2><0xA7> 154 of the Criminal Code) and for the exchange of compacts the rate would be from six months to two years
(Section 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious under <0xC2><0xA7> 184.2 of the Criminal Code than downloading a film to a DVD.
F. Unauthorized distribution of copyrighted films is punished vice versa than the provision of pornographic material to minors (<0xC2><0xA7> 186).
So if my colleague isn't wrong, someone's hand has caught on, and that's okay.

My attending physician pushes me one of his articles about strange research called “Money causes brain activation, especially if others get less.”
The feelings that a monthly paycheck causes for employees don’t hurt, depending on how much they earn.
The research was conducted at the University of Bonn using magnetic resonance imaging on a tomograph and the results are published in the latest issue of the journal Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and lead author of the group Neurocognitive Imaging at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: "The greatest activation occurred when the research participant reacted correctly and his or her colleague reacted incorrectly."
The researchers observed that if they both succeeded, they received the same pay, the activation was mild, but when one received double, the activation was higher.
I really don’t know if this conclusion required so much science.

Which insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which protects the driver in the event of an accident. represents a significant expense, which depends on various factors, such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of the driver's license, type of vehicle to be insured or its use, etc.
Having a car is just the beginning.
Choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing a car model.
First of all, we need to clarify what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between the insurance company and the insurer.
This obligation takes the form of an insurance contract, which stipulates that the insurance company will receive an agreed amount of insurance for taking care of the payment of damages in the event of an insurance event.
Insurance is the price of insurance, which is determined taking into account various factors such as age, condition, gender, length of possession of the driver's license, type of vehicle being insured or its use, etc.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the more likely it is that a crash will occur, the higher the insurance rate.
For this reason, both people over the age of 25 and women have to pay lower insurance premiums, as statistics show that they have a lower risk index due to their caution.
In the same way, on the basis of checks, insurance companies concluded that people living in marriage have fewer accidents than free drivers.
The way the vehicle is used will affect the frequency of travel, and thus the likelihood of having an accident.
The increase in the frequency of travel increases the likelihood.
There are many variables that insurance companies consider when setting the price of an insurance policy.
Therefore, the driver must carefully study the situation in order to choose the type of insurance that best suits his insurer profile.
We will show here the most important variables for the selection of this or that type of insurance, which, in addition to satisfying the type of insurer, will also be at a reasonable price.
People under the age of twenty-five face various disadvantages such as little driving experience and a short driving license when they want to arrange insurance at an affordable price.
Although insurance is ideal for good coverage against all risks, there are cheaper options as well.
The most observant drivers can choose insurance against all risks with the insurance company discount so that they get insurance coverage for all risks, but at a more affordable price.
This type of contract would involve the participation of the client in the payment of the insurance event.
"The part of the insurance event payment provided by the client will be determined in advance when determining the price of the insurance premium, which will be the higher, the lower the participation," explains Luis Noguera, chief executive of First Europe in Spain, an online insurance broker.
Another option is insurance extended to other participants of the operation so that the client insures against damage caused to other persons, but not against damage to his own car.
In addition, it would be insured against theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
Recommendations.
If you are under the age of twenty-five, try to be careful and avoid accidents as much as possible, as this will affect your bonus and allow you to reduce your insurance in the future.
The bonus is a reduction in the base rate that the insurance company has.
On the contrary, the malus is an increase in the said basic rate.
"Bonus and malus will depend on the insurance company and its profits.
If the insurance company has a good year, it will be able to afford to increase the bonus," Noguera explains.
After crossing the twenty-five-year limit, it is easier for drivers when they go to arrange insurance, as the client’s risk index is reduced for them, thanks to the experience gained.
For this reason, it is most recommended to take out insurance against all risks with a discount.
"Young people usually cannot take advantage of the experience gained in advance at the time of the accident, and even when driving," says the director of the European company in Spain, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of the procedure, when the "fear of the novice" has already been overcome.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children, it is better to take out insurance against all risks, if his economic situation allows.
Families with children are considered to be the clientele with the lowest risk index and therefore their premiums will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be insurance against all risks with an insurance discount (which could amount to 300 euros) or with a high bonus, insurance extended to other participants of the operation, starting in the third year after the purchase of the vehicle.
“Their management is calmer and their purchasing power is higher, so they can afford the luxury of getting the highest discount,” Luis Noguera notes.
Pensioners are advised to take out insurance against all risks with a discount of insurance (which is 150 euros) or insurance extended to other participants of the operation, if a high bonus has been achieved.
It has to be said that car insurance is important not only because it protects the driver in the event of a crash, but also because it represents a significant expense, which is a good reason to study the insurance options that would suit us most in view of our personal situation.
Celtic are trying to score on the AC Milan point, which means the semi-finals
AC Milan and Celtic will measure their strength this Tuesday at San Siro Stadium in an effort to get the point they lack to reach their respective goals in the Champions League final, as for Italy it would be the first and for the Scots it would decide the location.
The Italians have ten points and have already secured progress in the fifth match of the draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but he needs another one to make sure that the Six with six points will not get ahead of him, who will play with Benfica, who has four.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth round, as AC Milan must play in the Intercontinental Cup in Japan, where they will enter the thirteenth in the semi-finals for the first time, in an attempt to advance to the final, which is played the sixteenth.
So this group will be closed ahead of the others and an indecisive result at the Giuseppe Meazzy Stadium seems to be the most likely, even if the two teams try to compete for victory, because the Italians will not want to tackle on home soil and Celtic knows that after the win, the finish would be better to take first place.
Even a loss could be enough for Gordon Strachan's team if Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't count on it, because at the same number of nine points, Ukrainians who lost in Glasgow last week (2:1) but won in the first straight game (2:0) will pass.
So AC Milan players will try to ruin the evening for the Scots, who believe that for the second time they will get to the semi-finals in the reorganized Champions League just as they defeated them in the same match in the last competition with an extension goal by Kaka (1:0) after a 0:0 status in the basic playing time.
Hoping to win the "rossoneri" will be the chess player for whom the prize is won only if Celtic lose, both for progress to the semi-finals and for staying in UEFA.
Benfica, despite being last and not able to continue in the highest European competition, could reach third place with one win, so she would play in UEFA.
The first concert of the Spice Girls tour was attended by 20,000 people in Vancouver
The Spice Girls began their first tour in Vancouver, Canada, in front of 20,000 people since they broke up in 2000.
"Posh Spice" (Victoria Beckham), "Scary Spice" (Melanie Brown), "Baby Spice" (Emma Bunton), "Sporty Spice" (Melanie Chisholm) and "Ginger Spice" (Geri Halliwell) shortly before they started their gig at the GM Place Stadium in Vancouver, the band announced they were joining.
About 20,000 people bought tickets to attend the concert, which also included a video that tells the story of the group, which caused a sensation in the late 1990s.
The return and world tours take place at the same time as they release a new album, which is released in Spain by EMI, which brings a selection of their main successful songs, as well as two new songs, "Headlines" and "Voodoo".
Five Spice Girls appeared on the stage decorated with bracelets given to them by their husband "Posh Spice", British footballer David Beckham.
This athlete was in the audience that flooded GM Place, even though nervous Victoria banned him a few days ago.
Before the show began, Victoria Beckham said of the British star that "he didn't see our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what he thinks about the show."
"Sporty Spice", whose departure from the group in 1998 "due to disagreements between us" caused the dissolution of the five-member group two years later, also revealed her nervousness when meeting with journalists two hours before the start of the show.
"I was afraid.
I was nervous, but I saw that the public opinion of the world changed, the opinion of the Spice Girls changed.
And I thought, why not, so I’m glad I made the decision,” Chisholm said of the band’s reunion, which she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have settled and we all love each other very much."
However, a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
So, at first, according to CTV, the group flew to Vancouver with the Virgin Airlines special.
On arrival at the airport, the army of nannies was waiting for them.
Five have a total of seven children.
After the concert in Vancouver, the band will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4) and Los Angeles (December 5 and 7).
He will appear in Madrid on December 23.
Concerns about a new gas dispute between Russia and Ukraine
There is a dispute between Russia and Ukraine over the price of natural gas, which increases the risk that Russian supplies of this fuel to Western Europe may be affected.
Most of the Russian fuel exported to the European Union (EU) is piped through Ukraine and any dispute between the two countries is closely monitored.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow raises gas prices for Ukraine, it will charge Russia higher transit fees.
A previous dispute between the two last year reduced deliveries to EU countries.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow comes at a time when the Ukrainian government and Russia’s state-owned gas monopoly, Gazprom, are trying to agree on how much Ukraine will have to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom says it will have to charge Ukraine more because it has agreed to pay up to 50% more for gas it receives from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could mean that Ukraine will have to pay 40% more for its supplies from Gazprom.
“It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transit states during the negotiations,” Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinach told Reuters.
“Changes in gas prices should undoubtedly be linked to our arguments regarding the amount of transit charges (to Western Europe) through Ukraine.”
The last major dispute between Moscow and Kiev caused a reduction in supplies from Gazprom to Ukraine in January 2006.
This caused a crushing drop in exports to Western Europe, which sharply increased prices.
Russian gas accounts for one-quarter of the EU’s gas supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it remains underutilized.
As a result, Gazprom is supplementing its own gas supplies from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian republics.
The NHS "must control foreign workers"
The controller said the Scottish Chambers of the NHS must improve the checks of criminal records on non-European employees.
The recommendation from the president of the Supreme Audit Office, Robert Black, came after a foreign doctor working in Scotland was linked to the June attacks on Glasgow Airport.
Mr Black is also concerned that the Scottish NHS has no precise idea of the number of foreign staff it employs.
But his report stressed that other key controls were in order on a sample of five health authorities.
Immediately after the June attacks on Glasgow Airport, the President of the Supreme Audit Office was interested in the personnel obtained from countries outside the European Economic Area.
Bilal Abdullah, 22, an Iraqi doctor at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, was detained at the airport after someone hired a Jeep into the door of the main terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who appeared at the Central Criminal Court using a video bridge accused of links to attempts at bombings in the UK.
The NHS Chambers are expected to screen foreign staff for qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the UK prior to their employment.
Although the Scottish Health Commissions use Disclosure Scotland for criminal records checks, this agency has no authority to obtain such information outside the UK.
The report of the President of the Supreme Audit Office says, among other recommendations, that the commission should be guided by the guidelines of the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with audits in several countries.
"Although we found that some of the personnel records contained evidence of these checks, they are not carried out on a regular basis," the report said.
Mr Black said the Scottish NHS is largely in line with its own pre-employment screening policy, but also added: “Our report points to areas where the system could be improved to ensure accurate information on the number of foreign staff is available.”
BMA Scotland chairman Dr Peter Terry said it was "very unlikely" that pre-employment checks would identify potential NHS employees who could commit a terrorist act in the future.
"The report suggests that the current pre-employment checks in the Scottish NHS are working well and it is not clear what additional value these comments will bring," he said.
The Scottish health authorities have announced that they currently have 1,161 foreign workers, the vast majority of whom are doctors and nurses.
However, the president of the Supreme Audit Office pointed out that these numbers will probably be higher also because the commission had a problem identifying personnel with a residence permit.
The survey also found that the established control procedures at the NHS in the areas of Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian are largely implemented.
They included passport checks, work permits and qualifications.
The Scottish government is currently revising the policy and guidelines on pre-employment checks for NHS foreign workers.
Health Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: "I wanted to do this work immediately after the terrorist attack on Glasgow Airport."
She also added that the Scottish government, in agreement with the Health Commissions, will consider the recommendations of this report and ensure that best practices are reflected in the updated pre-employment screening guidelines of all staff – including those from abroad – that it plans to issue next month.
Joy Division wins film awards
Control, a biographical film about the late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, won five awards at the British Independent Film Awards, including Best Picture.
The awards were also given to the star Sam Riley, who worked in the warehouse until the role of Curtis, director Anton Corbijn and in the supporting role of Toby Kebell.
Lady Judi Dench was named the best actress for the thriller Notes on the Scandal.
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the Variety Award for getting a British film on the world stage.
The awards were presented at the Roundhouse in London.
Control describes Curtis' journey to fame with the Joy Division until his suicide in 1980 at the age of 23.
This black-and-white film — whose soundtrack features The Killers, David Bowie and New Order — cost just <0xC2><0xA3>3 million.
But he won two awards to Dutch photographer Corbijn, previously known for his iconic cover of U2’s Joshua Tree, for best director and best debut director.
Rock music was the focus of another award-winning film - because Julien Templ's film about the singer Clash Joe Strummer won the award for best documentary.
Viggo Mortensen won Best Actor for his role as the driver of the Russian mafia boss in the London thriller David Cronenberg's Eastern Promise.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation built on the roles of tough guys, won the Richard Harris Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Film.
This 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nile By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming another Indiana Jones film, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.
Winstone said he is proud of this award, which is named after the movie star Camelot and Harry Potter Harris, who died in 2002.
"People like Richard Harris and Albert Finney have opened the door for people like me," he said.
"I was lucky enough to meet Richard Harris several times.
He's my man, a great actor of his time, I'm very honored."
The independent film awards, known as Bify, are awarded by a jury of filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bif’s supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 people in connection with terror plot
Saudi Arabia announced yesterday that it had arrested 208 militants for membership in cells preparing for an immediate attack on oil facilities as well as on spiritual and security components.
State television of the largest oil exporter said that one of the cells wanted to install missiles in the country.
Al Qaeda sympathizers have been campaigning against the monarchy, allies of the United States, since 2003, that is, since the invasion of Iraq.
A television report reported that a cell of eight militants led by a foreigner was planning an attack on an oil rig in Ash-Sharqiyah province.
Saudi Arabia is building a 35,000-strong rapid-response unit to defend facilities from the failed al-Qaeda attack on the world’s largest oil processing plant in Abqaiq in 2006.
The report cited internal statements from the ministry: 18 detainees belonged to a cell led by a “missile launcher expert” who slipped into the country.
She also said that the militants were planning to smuggle eight shots into the kingdom.
Twenty-two of the detainees were to prepare for the killings of spiritual and security personnel.
The government urged clerics to do more to prevent Saudis from going to Iraq to join al-Qaeda militants fighting allied troops and a Shiite-backed U.S.-backed government that conservative Sunni Saudis consider heretical.
Al-Qaida militants believe that the authorities have co-opted many clerics in Saudi Arabia to support the royal family that controls the government.
The militants - backed by al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden's calls to focus on the pro-Western Saudi government - focused on foreign housing complexes, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This war has been a tremendous effort by the security forces in the past... five months," a State Department spokesman told state television.
A 16-member "media cell" in Medina was also arrested, which was aimed at promoting "Tachyrian thinking" - an ideology of Sunni Muslim radicals that promotes violence against Muslims labeled infidels and apostates.
Among those arrested were 32 people accused of providing financial support to the militants.
The climate of Venus may be a glimpse into the future of Earth
Scientists announced yesterday that Venus may have once been a pleasant place to live.
Data from a European orbiting station show that the planet is even more similar to Earth’s elusive twin than previously thought.
Venus is the closest planetary neighbor to Earth.
These two worlds are about the same size and orbit similar orbits, but Venus is a little closer to the Sun.
Scientists now believe that billions of years ago conditions on Venus were similar to those on Earth and could have been habitable.
But the faded greenhouse effect caused by carbon dioxide, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation, and lower speed of rotation sent Venus on a completely different path of development.
Today, the planet is without water, the temperature on the surface is hot enough to melt lead and it will be devastated by storms and winds of hurricane power.
Findings from the European Space Agency’s Venus Express spacecraft, which has been studying the planet for one year, offer a sobering view of how the Earth could evolve in the event of catastrophic climate change.
Professor Fred Taylor of the Department of Physics at Oxford University and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission said: “It is becoming increasingly clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, even though the planets themselves are quite similar.
"Our new data allows us to build a scenario in which Venus started out as Earth did, perhaps even with a habitable environment, billions of years ago."
Police Detain ‘Enriched Uranium’
A kilo of radioactive material, allegedly enriched with uranium, was detained yesterday by the Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were detained and the material is being investigated.
He did not confirm that it was enriched uranium, but said the substance could be sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
Still up-to-date
Mitt Romney said that for presidential candidates, it is not dignified to answer questions from a snowman.
Despite this, Republican presidential candidates later agreed to a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters recorded their questions on video and submitted them for broadcast to the candidates.
None of the questions aired on Wednesday were as comical as the snowman who asked Democrats about global warming in a second-party debate on YouTube.
But the questions and answers this time reflected much about the Republican Party’s state of mind for next year’s election.
It is unclear exactly how the producers of CNN, one of the sponsors of the debate, selected the clips, which were then shown to aspiring candidates.
But the first half-hour of the debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, was focused on immigration.
This is one of the most powerful Republican themes.
CNN asked a panel of undecided voters to turn the dial when they heard something gratifying: the voter noted the peaks of agreement when candidates spoke of a hard border approach.
The toughest and longest exchange of views took place between Rudy Giuliani, the main national candidate, and Mr. Romney, who stepped forward in key early votes in Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to shake the reputation of a man who, like the mayor of New York, was soft on illegal immigrants.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work at his home.
These two fought particularly hard when the questioners asked whether any of the candidates would support "amnesty" (to give illegal immigrants a normal status and the possibility of citizenship).
Substitute candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, were able to throw their bit into the mill on the subject.
Neither of them has a chance to be nominated, but both remain in the game, perhaps because they started to sound the alarm about immigration earlier and more strongly than the others.
At least for immigration, the candidates have about the same opinion: more strictness at the borders, no tolerance for illegal migrants.
This theme, along with concerns about poisonous toys from China and other concerns with the world around them, helps Republicans forget or minimize the contradiction between libertarians and Christian conservatives.
But the debate started to get very uncomfortable when other topics came up.
Mr Giuliani was asked why he had supported the possession of firearms in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the simulated heating technique should be considered torture.
One questioner asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
Through it, Mr. Giuliani stumbled to the idea that even though the Bible is his favorite book, he probably doesn’t believe the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another inquirer asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - who is now against all assumptions in the first place in a recent survey in Iowa due to his long-standing Christian conservatism - said the death penalty is unpleasant but necessary.
Under pressure to decide whether Jesus would agree, he said Jesus was too smart to run for office, thereby earning himself a laugh.
The fight remains extraordinarily open.
Mr. Huckabee’s rise in Iowa is overshadowed by recent success in raising money and the loud cheers of Ron Paul in Wednesday’s debate.
These two have bounced off the bottom because both wings of the party still can’t agree on more familiar and traditional candidates.
In 1980 and 2000, one of the candidates united the party very quickly and convincingly with a winning report on the American size on the lips, blinking on both wings of the party.
This time the page is fragmented and the result is far from clear.
Labour's disease
Gordon Brown again found a trap to fall into; his way out remains the same.
Although this is the custom in British political scandals, it is not particularly spicy.
It doesn’t seem like any orders have been sold, no bills at the Paris hotel have been mysteriously paid, no extra-marital rings have been tampered with.
But the barricaded Gordon Brown would have done without it being discovered that some wealthy businessman had for four years masked contributions to the ruling Labour Party in the amount of <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million) under the names of other people, and that the party had not reported it.
Two months ago, when the prime minister avoided calling an election and insulted British intelligence by claiming that this decision was not influenced by the polls, there was hope that it would ensure a resilient and effective government.
Instead of being formulated by an increasingly funny Liberal Democrat president, the once-fearful Mr. Brown changed from Stalin to Mr. Bean.
The bailout of the troubled Northern Rock bank showed weaknesses in management and poor judgment under fire.
Misguided proposals to change the tax code have brought companies together against the government.
The loss of personal data in 25 million people has revealed unimaginable administrative blunder.
Three retired generals started a rebellion in the House of Lords; they protested against cuts in military spending, claiming that being a commander of the armed forces was part-time work.
Now here are the many-year-old gifts from David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour general secretary (and their former guardian of the inner disciplines), has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocably headed for his end.
Despite this, governments can reach the tipping point behind which they find governance difficult.
People don’t believe politicians and don’t like them, but they usually put off their mistrust when a new party takes over.
When it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve anything, and not even have to be in office for a long time, this shift is gone: the state administration is becoming a bore, ministers are starting to do briefings, the press is looking for bad news, and the government is becoming unfocused and defunct.
In one sense, Mr. Brown's position is particularly complex, as he cannot take the position of a new broom, compared to other political leaders.
No matter how much he wanted to distance himself from Tony Blair, he was his first officer.
For example, the problems with Northern Rock and the financial office records are linked to the decisions Mr Brown made as finance minister.
And while he wasn’t directly involved in Blair’s malarities, such as the lengthy investigation of political party funding caused by “value for money,” voters can safely conclude he was.
Still, Mr. Brown's troubles aren't as bad as they seem.
Those hugs aren't as horrible as the conservatives make them.
As far as Mr. Bean is concerned, no one has died or been deliberately deceived.
And the cure, however painful it may be, is to provide what Mr. Brown’s Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable, firm, and slightly brutal government.
The latest upheaval around political gifts is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his gifts to charity, says he did not want any publicity for his charity.
That may be true, but the decision was not on him.
Laws against the anonymity of large political donors are clear and exist for a simple reason: the public has the right to know who could buy access to those who rule the country.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham's progress but did not know it was illegal, will certainly be thoroughly interrogated; so will Jon Mendlesohn, the chief Labour money-seeker, who learned of the skewed gifts in October.
But so far, Mr. Brown is not at all complicated; there is nothing to suggest that he knew about these braids, although the bulk of the payments did not take place until after his arrival in June.
The Prime Minister has done half the work.
He very quickly condemned this violation of the laws by his own party, but diluted his resolve by reaching out to a proven instrument, the commission of inquiry into the matter - moreover, led by a retired bishop and a judge.
In this case, the lessons are not complicated.
If the law has been broken, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr Brown must do, such as find a permanent chairman of the independent Committee on Standards in Public Life, which has not had one for six months, and proceed with a real reform of the funding of political parties.
That would require the Labours who are in a tight spot to cooperate with the Conservatives and perhaps even give up their special financial relationship with the unions - bitter pills for a devoted sidekick like Mr. Brown.
But it should face a few simple facts.
Conservatives now have a decent lead in polls; he has two years to win back voters; and the only way to win is unassailable integrity and high competence.

Does the subprime mortgage crisis affect the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, naturally, the spinal floss begins to stir excitedly around.
Now that the U.S. real estate market is shrinking, the predators have focused on the credit card market there.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs say credit card losses could reach $99 billion if other consumer loan options were to be affected by subprime mortgages.
The signs of tension are obvious.
There is a growing number of cases of inability to pay (with more than 30 days of late payment) and canceled accounts (accounts that the provider considers unenforceable).
HSBC reported last month that it had lost $1.4 billion in consumer loans in the U.S. market - also due to insolvent credit card loans.
However, it is still too early to panic.
Depreciated accounts and inability to pay are still few.
According to Moody's, the 3.89% default rate in the third quarter was almost the entire percentage point below average.
Worsening rates can be partly explained by technical reasons.
The change in the US Personal Bankruptcy Laws of 2005 led to a sharp decline in the number of reported bankruptcies that account for a large portion of credit card losses; the number of reports (and thus the number of write-offs) would therefore rise regardless of whether the general conditions for lenders have deteriorated.
The industry also has a good maturity rate, which shows how much consumers pay off their debts monthly.
And the trust in the securities of secured credit cards is firm, despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup predicts that their 2007 emissions will be 25% higher than last year.
There are definitely direct ways to spread the infection between the subprime mortgage crisis and the credit card market: when they wipe out property loans in real estate, consumers are more likely to borrow via credit cards.
However, credit card issuers look at the cash flow rather than the values of the underlying items, so falling home prices may not necessarily mean a change in lenders’ credibility.
They may even be beneficial to the loan provider.
Consumers’ motivation to repay mortgages declines when the value of their assets falls below the value of the loan; as a result, credit card debt moves up the list of repayment priorities.
Card issuers are also able to respond more quickly and flexibly to turbulent conditions than mortgage providers by changing interest rates or debt limits.
This should theoretically reduce the risks of a rapid change in the price of warranty items.
“It doesn’t happen that one fine morning we would just reassess all the loans,” says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer of Capital One.
While the risk of a subprime-style explosion is low, the danger of gradual weakening is far more real.
If lower home prices and debt cuts push America into recession, the credit card industry will face a darker future.
Watch out for those back fins.
British bankers plead guilty in Enron case
The three British bankers, who were due to be tried for their roles in a fraud involving former Enron chief financial officer Andrew Fastow, on Wednesday changed their statement and pleaded guilty.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew originally pleaded guilty to seven counts of fraud when they were to join Fastow in 2000 in a financial fraud -- to enrich themselves at the expense of their employers -- they denied.
They were due to appear in court in January.
However, during a court hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., everyone confessed to one fraud.
The case of these three former executives of Greenwich NatWest, a unit of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC, was featured on the front page for a full two years, which lasted the issuing procedure.
In the United States, their case is one of the unsealed parts of an investigation launched after the 2001 Enron crash.
The charges brought against them in 2002 alerted Mr Fastow that he was the target of a government investigation into the Enron crash.
The indictment against the bankers -- who earned the nickname "NatWest Troika" -- alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to devise a scam along with Fastow and his former chief aide Michael Kopper.
Greenwich NatWest invested in an Enron affiliate controlled by Fastow, who was the architect of many Enron scams that spurred Enron into bankruptcy.
At the beginning of 2002, the bank rated its stake in this branch as zero, but our three Britons knew that it actually had a significant value.
The company under Kopper’s control bought the bank’s stake in this branch for $1 million.
Indicted bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for his stake in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely informed Enron that the energy company would pay $20 million for its stake in this branch of Greenwich NatWest.
But the 20 million actually went to those British bankers, Fastow and others.
According to the indictment, the bankers received $7.3 million and Fastow, Kopper and others improved by about $12.3 million.
In January 2004, Fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in the collapse of Enron.
The British trio were arrested three months later.
Fastow is currently serving a six-year sentence in a federal prison in Louisiana.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence at a facility in Texarkana.
All three Britons were free to move on bail of $1 million, which ordered them to stay in the United States for the upcoming trial.
Enron, once the seventh-largest company in the country, collapsed into bankruptcy in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks meant it was no longer possible to hide billions of dollars of debt or report failing speculation as profitable.
The crash wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value, and more than $2 billion in retirement insurance.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and former chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were convicted last year for their roles in the company's downfall.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than twenty-four years.
Lay’s convictions for conspiracy, fraud and other charges were erased after he died of heart disease last year.
Moscow's non-power
The price of the Gulfstream G550, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and with a sufficient volume of fuel for nonstop flights from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at 54 million dollars.
For some of the Russian rich, however, it is small to return.
"It can carry up to 18 passengers," says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
"But none of them are interested in so many places because it's for a close family or corporate president."
Mr. Firer was sitting at the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire Show, a four-day orgy of showy consumption at a mammoth exhibition center on the outskirts of the capital.
In addition to the Gulfstream, more than 200 other luxury suppliers have built their booths, hoping that the newly-rich Russians will lure everything from mahogany-lined yachts to diamond-lined countertops to cars they wouldn’t be ashamed of even 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looked carefully at the bright orange Porsche in the side stand.
"It's a nice car, but against us it's cockroaches and decimals," he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest private jet market.”
On the waves of oil, money is poured into the Russian capital just as it was when Dallas had its days.
“We went through the same stage in the 1980s when some Americans got enormously rich and moved to Europe, where they looked at them as materialists,” said Marshall Goldman, a fourth-year listener at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard.
Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are becoming the world’s most prominent spenders.
The most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their part in this Klondike.
Elsewhere in Moscow this week, the luxury industry conference of Donatell Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, chairman of the LVMH group, attracted to exchange ideas on how to sell expensive goods in markets such as the Russian one.
(The conference is hosted by The International Herald Tribune, owned by The New York Times Company.)
According to the Forbes list of richest people, Russia has 53 billionaires with a total name of $282 billion.
In addition, the local head institute of the Center for Economic and Financial Research has issued a report on the development of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, according to which there are 103,000 "secondary" millionaires in Russia, whose assets total $ 670 billion.
(The World Bank reports that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians lived below the subsistence minimum.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow -- and that's why we're all here," said Nicole Marais, sales and marketing rep for London's David Morris Jewelry.
It was at the fair for the first time, together with the Russian distributor of this brand, Soho Jewelry Group.
"All women are perfectly groomed, and men are all for all their wealth."
As they walked through the halls in their evening dresses on Sunday evening, twenty-one-year-old Evgenia Yumatov<0xC3><0xA1> and five-year-old Svetlana Turovcov<0xC3><0xA1> described themselves and their clients as millionaires.
"I've been looking at those cars and I can't decide between Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche," said Miss Yumatova, who was dressed as a veteran of red carpets, alongside whom Joan Rivers looks like a homemaker.
The fair seemed to be mainly focused on freshly-fed, brand-controlled Russian buyers who are willing to sit for a few hours in road traffic to be able to walk through the warehouse, which shrillly mixes Cadillac Escalade, platinum fish, ice cream, m<0xC3><0xB6>b<0xC3><0xB6>n ice cream.
Members of the public could buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57).
"The Russians are interested in which brand is the most expensive and the best," said Mr. Gijrath, who patriotically occupied the stand of Dutch porcelain manufacturer Royal Delft before reproducing Rembrandt's hand-painted blue tile painting in super-life size.
"Of course the Russians are more interested in gold."
And indeed, here sellers say that Russians with old money (according to Russian standards it is 10 to 15 years old) have already moved from glittering logos to little-known limited-edition brands that would never show up at the shopping fair.
Even so, several thousand people, whether millionaires, millionaires’ ambassadors or simple tourists, every day flooded the fairgrounds.
And some of them were shopping.
On the first day of the show, last Thursday, Roman Ershov, the local general manager of King Koil’s bed, said he had sold two silk, cashmere and cotton mattress sets, laced with gold threads, for $70,000.
Also on the first day, Mikhail Lyubimov, sales manager of A1 Moto, which equips high-end cars with high-end alarms, said his company had sold a bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrej Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, which arranges luxury cars on request, said he had sold three chainsaw-style car grilles for the Rolls-Royce Phantom for $55,000.
He showed a reporter a car wheel designed for a Russian casino owner that had a splinter coated with Swarovski crystals that looked like a roulette wheel.
Price: $22,000 for four of them.
"The Russian millionaire who wants to ride a cobblestone wheel or a portrait of his wife from cubic zirconia doesn't have to ride those wheels yet," Karapetian said.
"They'll put them in their garage for thirty to forty cars."
Although many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian said that the phrase "Russian millionaire" does not mean anything very exclusive at the moment, given the large increase in the prices of local real estate.
"If you bought an apartment three or four years ago in Moscow, you're probably already millionaires, at least on paper, if not in cash," he said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who are not millionaires could at least fake wealth at a stand run by the Russian firm Alliance Continental, which deals with asset management.
The company erected four British-style red phone booths filled with a million-dollar column of fake banknotes.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team printed 500,000 fake banknotes for the Millionaires Fair.
The passers-by stopped to scatter around a pile of money, or to have their friends take a mobile phone photo of them resting in the middle of a spare fortune, or simply stuff a few million in their pocket.
"You know, in Moscow, everybody can feel like a millionaire," Mr. Karryev said.
Deaths in New Jersey May Have Been Caused by a Failed Operation
It was the day before Thanksgiving, when Roland Livingston looked out of the big windows of the restaurant A Little Healthier and watched the ambulance that came to the white New England cottage about two houses down West Scott Avenue.
A police car soon joined the patrol.
And then another.
'Then I saw the delivery of the forensic doctor arrive, 'said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant inspector.
"I knew at the time that someone had died."
Authorities have learned that the dead woman was Olga Arroya, 41, an executive assistant to the director of the New York Police Department.
Investigators are now trying to determine whether she died as a result of a procedure performed by an unlicensed plastic surgeon whose identity the police refused to provide, who worked at house number 212 on West Scott Avenue.
Authorities have not yet ascertained what caused Ms. Arroy's death, and they hope that toxicological tests, the results of which may not be known for weeks, will help solve the mysterious death that sent a wave of sadness through the leadership of the New York Police Department.
Ms. Arroy has been an assistant to the Director of Police, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice has been known to many in the department.
"She was loyal, tough and worked hard," Mr. McCarthy said of Ms. Arroy in a telephone interview Wednesday.
"She was my shield.
She'd protect me."
Mr. McCarthy stated that Ms. Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former police officer working for the Alcohol Control Commission, and that she left behind two sons aged 14 and 11 and did not have a daughter.
Eileen Walsh, Union District Attorney Theodora J. Romankowa, said detectives were trying to find out if Ms. Arroy had died as a result of unlicensed surgery.
"It's one of the options," Miss Walsh said.
"The investigation is still ongoing."
Officials said they arrived at the house around 3 p.m.
In November, they found Miss Arroy on the couch.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
More than a week later, the authorities still said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, who is allegedly Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh didn't say whether the authorities had questioned Ms. Castro.
Investigators are trying to determine whether a part of the house was used as an office.
In the middle of Miss Castro’s house, with a ruined rose bush in the front garden and a Dalmatian barking in the back, no one answered.
Next to the door leading to the cellar, a blue barrel with the inscription "Ethyl Vanillin" - a fabric used as a substitute for vanilla in food and cosmetics - reigned in the open garage.
Two mountain bikes hung on the hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy recalled that when he first arrived at the New York City Police Department in Newark after 25 years, Ms. Arroy provided invaluable assistance in sifting through the intolerable and harsh political culture of his new city.
"She said, 'You should be careful about this or that, '" he said.
"She was always here when I came, and she was always here when I left.
It was embarrassing."
The hope that the Fed will lower interest rates leads to a strengthening of world exchanges
Share prices on both sides of the Atlantic surged yesterday after market hopes that the Federal Bank would try to calm lending conditions by further lowering interest rates were bolstered by reassuring statements by the US Central Bank’s vice president.
The stock market surged in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, second in line behind Ben Bernanke, the Fed’s chairman, said that in response to continued pressure on financial markets, the drivers must be “flexible and pragmatic.”
As part of an apparent effort to calm irritated markets amid signs of reviving credit strain, Mr Kohn said recent upheavals “partly reversed some of the improvements in the functioning of the markets at the end of September and in October.”
He added that if the increased instability persists, there will be an increased possibility that the financial conditions of households and companies will deteriorate further.
Investors see these statements as a signal that the Fed is poised to deliver additional fresh capital injections to U.S. markets, and possibly further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
These remarks also helped calm Wall Street amid other bad news about the U.S. economy, when apartment sales in October posted record lows.
The consequences of the financial whirlwind were underscored by the announcement by investment bank Bear Stearns that it will cut 650 jobs, which is 4% of its global workforce, as part of a cost reduction to compensate for the heavy losses caused by the failed bet on providing sub-prime housing loans.
It is expected that only 20 of these places will be abolished in London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 331 points, or 2.55 percent, to close at 13,289.40, while the more widely used S&P 500 index rose 2.65 percent.
The London FTSE 100 index increased by 165.5 points, or 2.7 percent, and closed at 6,306.2, with the value of British blue-chips rising by more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion.
The German Dax index rose 2.6 percent and the French CAC40 rose 2.3 percent.
Some time ago, lending tensions in the markets proved to be in full swing after the European Central Bank’s three-month money packages auctioned these funds to European commercial banks at a rate of 4.7%, the highest since April 2001.
The pressure on the Bank of England to follow the Fed and the ECB and release over-the-counter money into London’s money markets has increased with the rates of three-month British interbank loans “Libor” rising after a steady growth from November 12 to its peak of 6 per cent.
England must decide: Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
We have two dilemmas, one almost as difficult as the other.
Who will be number six on the bat for England this weekend in Kandy, Owais Shah, or Ravi Bopara?
And, in a broader context no less relevant than the first Test against Sri Lanka, who has made this decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the selection committee, who holds this post at best in the borrowed time, has Peter Moores, the head coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, with the decision to help, and because the table of Hugh Morris, the head manager, would not be held at the post of chief executive officer.
He who will not be placed in sixth place on the bat will be unhappy, but life is often not fair and sport is not at all.
It is not easy to find what will get one to the top of his profession, while someone else will never get over the lower level, sometimes due to lack of happiness rather than ability.
Not only in cricket, selection is demanding and requires judgment, which ultimately always has to be subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to move up?
Is it fair to Shah, if so?
We could ask the same question in another area, say here: John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, both smart young executives with good education and an overview in the field, should be promoted to the commission - there is room for only one.
Who is to say which level is right for the cricketer if he is not given a chance to fall or swim to the next one?
Of course, numbers have a big influence on decision-making, but so do opportunities.
In the team, the cricketer must capture the captain’s eye at the right time if he is to take the wicket, and the batsman needs a regular chance at starting positions if he is ever to make an impression as a one-day cricketer.
Capturing the view of the selector is more complicated.
For example, last season there were many better than James Anderson, whose place in the first Test seems certain, even if Stephen Harmison declared himself healthy and pitched as a gunman.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 overs for each.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 at the same modest average, but both had their moments at the highest level and hope for the next.
Whether he will play in the stadium of Asgiriya Shah or Bopara can only be a matter of opinion.
The choice can start or end a career of both, or it may not have much of an impact.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and in the first class gave good performances, five wickets and 40 overs, but it was Paul Collingwood who at the same time was fighting for his place, who eventually became a stable Test cricketer, who is in addition, despite being a stalwart against Australia.
It is more likely that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after another discussion following today’s training cleanly at Asirgiya Stadium, will follow their conservative instincts and prefer Shah’s greater experience to Bopar’s youthful splendour.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, his sparkling and valuable debut Test exchanges speak at 88 points in Bombay and 32 hundred in the first class compared to six Boparov, who is, at twenty-two years old, seven years younger and has excellent statistics against spin bursts.
However, Shah did so in two shifts in May against the Caribbean in the Test at Lord's, his home field in Middlesex, just ten passes, and this, along with the immediate rejection of the selectors, when Vaughan wanted to recapture him from the next game, was his departure.
In contrast, the Essex universal has joie de vivre in its bones.
On the cricket pitch, he is not shy and his off-field behaviour symbolizes a recently turned-up car with a four-wheel drive on the day of the exhibition of the car sponsor of the English team, Volkswagen.
He left with minor injuries and possibly shock, but first thing he pulled out his Vodafone (of course also sponsored) and called Alastair Cook, his co-player, who was watching it from a distance to ask him excitedly, "Did you see that?"
Bopara is definitely better in the field, his medium-speed skids on the local courts, which seem to suit him, distributes effectively and fires confidently and skillfully.
Choosing the right person is one thing, choosing the right time is another.
Perhaps this is the true art of choice.
Personally, I am inclined to give Bopara his chance now, which is not to say that Shah will not excel, if, as Ceylon tea leaves suggest, he will be the one to play next weekend.
Buses bring refugees back to work - and to fight against al-Qaeda
The first buses full of Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday and squandering refugees who ran out of money or expired visas, and others who hoped the city would return to normal life.
Some have even returned to fight with the gunmen who drove them out of their homes.
The Mansour bus station was already there before 800 people arrived from Damascus in an official government convoy of a dozen buses, full of refugees from Syria and Jordan, who returned by private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad," said Sabah al-Kubaissi, a Sunni doctor.
"I came back today because of what I saw on TV and what I read in the papers, what was going on in Baghdad and how safe it is now.
"They say that Mahdi's army has stopped killing people," he said, referring to the Shi'ite militia of the militant clerical Muqtada al-Sadr, who temporarily ordered his people to stop fighting.
Kasim al-Atwani, an eighty-year-old Shiite teacher from the predominantly Sunni area of Amariya, returned with his two children because he could no longer renew Syrian visas and because the regime there did not allow Iraqis to work.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariya called him with the news that a local militia backed by the US military had helped push al-Qaeda out of its positions in the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the newcomers from Jordan is a leader of the Sunni and Shiite tribe who was driven from his home in Sleikh in northern Baghdad by a grenade attack after he urged his fellow citizens to rebel against al-Qaeda.
He came back to fight.
"A few friends called me the day before and told me that they were setting up a militia in Sleikh against al-Qaida and that they needed me and the support of my boys.
That's why I came back today," Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 60, said.
Many spoke of the attraction of calm in the capital after the strengthening of the U.S. military presence and the growth of local “groups of concerned citizens” who, armed with guns alongside the U.S. military, are defending their neighborhood.
But more has been said about the return of Iraqis caused by visa restrictions and the loss of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have fled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarraj, the 51-year-old father of three children, voiced suspicion shared among the refugees that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, had asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugee visas and force them to return.
According to available data, more than two and a half million people have fled from Iraqi sectarian killers.
“Everything was fine before al-Maliki visited Syria and pushed the government to stop giving Iraqis visas to have to go back to Iraq,” the Sunni pensioner said.
"I can't trust the government that supports the criminals who burned my house down after I left."
Part of the reason for the weakening of the violence is the fact that the Sunnis were pushed out of Shiite areas and vice versa, which in many places reduces tensions.
There are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will rekindle sectarian tensions and lead to further fighting.
Little S<0xC3><0xA1>rsko, good education
Germany’s smallest federal country plays a leading role in vocational education, excelling even in the international focus of its universities.
In just one area of education, Sars is worried about the same shortage as the rest of Germany.
"To a man who does not come from Sars, I explained yesterday for the 50th time that we are not French" - this Sebeironic slogan appears on posters in Sars on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the birth of this smallest federal country.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg play a major role in the Saracen education system, which is in fifth place in the monitoring of the education of the Cologne Institute for Economic Research (IW).
Universities have traditionally cooperated closely with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbr<0xC3><0xBC>cken was founded in 1948 by the French.
To date, students can complete their studies with a double or even a triple degree.
This corresponds to a reasonably high proportion of foreign students, which is 15.6%.
After all, an above-average number of Saracen children are admitted to high school - many of them even without studying at the gymnasium.
“In S<0xC3><0xA1>rsk, a professional education system is used,” says Axel Pl<0xC3><0xBC>nnecke, IW’s education expert.
With more than one in five young people gaining access to a vocational school, S<0xC3><0xA1>rsko is more than 7% above the German average.
Compared to the rest of Germany, there are plenty of opportunities in Saarland to combine practical and academic education.
The opportunities to study two fields are the second best in Germany, given the number of inhabitants.
Despite a practically oriented education and increasing demand, the number of engineering graduates has decreased by a third in recent years.
That is why the Saracen Ministry of Education has now ordered universities to create a promotion campaign in the engineering fields.
"After the first study of Pisa, we made several reforms in general education schools," says a spokesman for the Ministry of Education.
Therefore, the government has introduced comparative tests throughout Germany.
In order for children to start learning as soon as possible, the last year of kindergarten is free - a model that is adopted by other federal countries.
If the results of the students improve significantly, future comparative studies will show.
When the Pisa study was carried out in 2003, the proportion of pupils at risk decreased from 29 to 20 %.
Overall, however, Syria has not improved as much as other federal states.
The Bavarians can count better.
And to S<0xC3><0xA1>rsk’s disappointment, Pisa’s studies do not compare knowledge of foreign languages – otherwise S<0xC3><0xA1>rsk could score points in this area.
The language of the neighbours is compulsory in the gymnasiums - even if the inhabitants of Saarland are not French.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez moves the clock
What not to see will take hours in Venezuela differently than in the rest of the world.
On December 9th, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez will have the clocks in this South American country moved back half an hour.
In Spain, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is becoming a ridiculous figure.
Venezuela’s official newspaper reported that the new law says the clock will shift by minus four and a half hours compared to world time.
The South American state will be this step in a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Chavez, the enemy of the United States, justified his decision, among other things, by the United States imposing on the world the division of time zones by hours.
In addition, on Wednesday, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez announced that he is interrupting relations with neighboring Colombia due to the hostage situation.
This left-wing nationalist has declared that as long as conservative Alvaro Uribe is president of Colombia, he will not maintain any relations with him or with the Colombian government.
"I can't because of my self-respect anymore," said Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is pushing for a reform of the constitution that the citizens of this oil country must vote on in Sunday's referendum.
With this reform, Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez would significantly strengthen his power in the country.
The dispute was sparked by Uribe's decision to withdraw Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez's mandate to negotiate in Colombia with Marxist rebels for the release of hostages.
Uribe's decision "swept into the face" of Venezuela, he criticized on Sunday Uribe Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez.
In Spain, everyone talks about Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez.
The new mobile ringtone here sparked a stir: "Por qué no te callas" (Why aren't you quiet anymore?) - that's the phrase that more than half a million people have already downloaded from the Internet.
It was spoken by the Spanish king Juan Carlos, who at a recent Ibero-American summit was so enraged by the vocal remarks of this left-wing populist that he was silenced in this way.
German workers at risk of lower wages in 2007
According to the forecast, German employees are at risk of falling real wages this year, despite the strong economic situation.
Experts have justified their pessimistic prognosis for a number of reasons.
According to estimates by the Hans B<0xC3><0xB6>ckler Foundation, in 2007 employed people can actually expect to receive a lower salary than they did last year.
"The wine carries a small increase in wages, an increase in value added tax and an increase in food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the research institute IMK (Institut f<0xC3><0xBC>r Makro<0xC3><0xB6>konomie und Konjunkturforschung) told Bild.
New burdens on employees may also lie ahead in the area of unemployment insurance.
Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck told the Neue Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung newspaper that the planned reduction of unemployment insurance contributions to 3.3% by the new year is right and reasonable in this situation.
However, the Federal Labour Agency should no longer fall into such difficulties that it must demand loans or contributions from the federal youth, the newspapers of this socially democratic policy quoted.
On Tuesday, it was announced that the price explosion of food and oil products had driven inflation to its highest level in 13 years.
In the year-on-year comparison, prices increased by a total of three percent.
Venus is the twin hell of the Earth
Despite its hostile atmosphere, Venus is more similar to Earth than previously thought. The European space probe Venus Express on Venus has recorded phenomena that occur on Earth in winter: lightning in the atmosphere and windy beliefs on the poles.
For almost three decades, scientists have known that Venus is shining.
Now the European probe Venus Express has brought evidence - captured electromagnetic waves on the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus, lightning flies from cloud to cloud at an altitude of about 56 kilometers, wrote in the scientific magazine Nature Christopher Russel of the University of California, Los Angeles.
According to a well-known theory of the origin of primary matter, life could have arisen on Earth thanks to lightning. Storms allegedly triggered reactions in the oceans that led to the formation of amino acids, the basic stones of life.
On Venus, this was not the case: “If life ever existed there, it must have been a very long time ago,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution in Washington.
Today, there is hardly anything living on the surface of Venus. The atmosphere is about a hundred times denser than on Earth and sometimes there are temperatures around 500 °C.
"Venus may be the hellish twin of Earth, but it's a twin," Russell said.
Why Venus, which is so similar in mass and size to Earth, began to evolve in a completely different way, is a fundamental question of the ESA mission.
Since no spacecraft had been launched exclusively for the purpose of studying Venus since the early 1990s, the launch of the Venus Express spacecraft in November 2005 was a milestone in the research of this planet.
According to scientists, the latest research results, which brought several articles of the journal Nature, did not only emphasize the uniqueness of Venus in the solar system.
"They also showed that our neighboring planet is more Earth-like than previously thought," ESA said.
In addition to the already known wind gusts at the North Pole, scientists have found a cloudy gust at the South Pole that rotates significantly faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in the Earth’s northern hemisphere, writes a research team led by Guiseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Astrophysics Spaziale e Fisica Cosmica.
The second innermost planet in our solar system is made up of almost the same mass as Earth, and with an average of 12,100 km it is almost as big.
This planet, referred to as the Morning Star or the Evening Star, will orbit the Sun in about 225 days.
However, it rotates much slower around its own axis. One day on Venus lasts 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus does not resemble the Earth at a surface temperature of 460 °C and a pressure of 92 bar, scientists assume that the two planets formed under very similar conditions.
Water accumulated on both of them, but remained in the oceans on Earth, while it evaporated from Venus into space.
While carbon dioxide on Earth is bound in carbonates on Earth, Venus makes up most of the atmosphere.
K<0xC3><0xB6>hler defends Merkel's meeting with Dalai Lama
Federal President K<0xC3><0xB6>hler calls for an end to party disputes over the acceptance of the Dalai Lama in the chancellor’s office.
He indirectly criticized the SPD for its attacks on the chancellor after a mutual meeting in September.
Federal President Horst K<0xC3><0xB6>hler worries about Germany’s reputation and calls on the grand coalition to end the fight over the acceptance of the Dalai Lama.
"We should not present ourselves on the outside as a nation that is not united on this issue," K<0xC3><0xB6>hler told the economic newspaper Handelsblatt.
At the same time, he expressed his understanding for the decision of German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to accept the Dalai Lama in September.
"Although I respect cultural differences, human rights are universal to me," K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
The Federal President stressed that everyone knows that Germany must maintain a reasonable balance in foreign policy, but this did not prevent Merkel from standing up when she was criticized for creating a new policy towards China.
“The Federal Chancellor has not abandoned the traditional policy of a united China.
China knows that too," K<0xC3><0xB6>hler said.
Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier (SPD) indirectly expressed his disagreement with the acceptance of the Dalai Lama, and was attacked by the coalition because of this.
Steinmeier complained, among other things, about the coalition’s “predictable” foreign policy.
After the adoption of the Dalai Lama in the Chancellery, German-Chinese relations deteriorated.
Not only did the Chinese government cancel the invitation of German Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck (SPD), but according to SPIEGEL magazine, it also froze the so-called strategic dialogue between the foreign ministries of the two countries.
Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao has called on Chancellor Angela Merkel to recognize that accepting the Dalai Lama was a mistake.
China does not approve when European politicians officially accept the Tibetan spiritual leader, Wen Jiabao stressed China's position.
The words and actions of the Dalai Lama have shown that Tibet, along with other Tibetan areas that are also located on the territory of China, is trying to separate from China.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns of similar unrest in France
Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble warns of similar riots that have broken out in France, with police fighting, shootings and burning cars.
We must do everything to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not turn into street violence, the Federal Minister of the Interior calls.
Barricades were burning, rioters fired rifles at the police. After serious riots of teenagers in France, the Federal Minister of the Interior Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble (CDU) is afraid of similar developments in Germany.
"We have to be careful not to create such social tension in our country that it will erupt in violence.
We have to take it seriously," he told the Neue Presse newspaper in Hanover.
Not every young person can cope with the rapid change in social reality.
The federal government, countries and municipalities are already working hard to remove the problems, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble said.
This is not just about the integration of migrants.
"Since the summit on integration after the conference on Islam, we have had our first successes."
However, caution is still in place.
Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble at the same time pointed out that the planning and sociological problems of the German suburbs are not comparable to those of the French.
In recent nights, young people with police in the northern suburbs of Paris have been engaged in fierce street fighting.
Cars and public buildings were also on fire in Toulouse.
Greater integration efforts of the German government were demanded by the president of the Turkish municipality in Germany, Kenan Kolat.
In view of the unrest in France, Kolat warned against the "imitation effect".
The situation in Germany should not be as explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, action should be taken.
Kolat pointed out that among people under the age of 25, who come from migrant families, the unemployment rate is "on average high".
Above all, it is necessary to ensure a greater number of study opportunities.
Kolat stressed: "We have to give young people hope."
However, the president of the Turkish municipality added that in Germany, unlike France, there is greater social control of families.
Moreover, many youths from migrant families do not want to destroy what their parents built here.
Kolat said, "But we have to be careful."
We need to "quickly allow young people to start working and getting educated."
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel remained mostly quiet.
Hundreds of police were deployed, and a helicopter with flashlights flew over the area.
Authorised authorities have reported three arrests and several burning trash bins and cars.
Since yesterday, about 1,000 law-enforcement forces have taken care of the peace.
Police will intervene for as long as necessary, Interior Minister Michelle Alliot-Marie said after a visit to the suburbs.
Around 80 police officers were injured in riots in the suburb of Villiers-le-Bel on Tuesday night.
The following night, the riots in Toulouse began.
Sunday’s traffic accident, in which two youths lost their lives, caused a stir.
According to the initial findings of the State Prosecutor’s Office, the police do not bear any blame for the death of minors.
In the Empire of Angela "Clouds"
The Chancellor’s reality remote exit documents that the coalition is at the end of the program and that we can’t expect anything more from it.
What country does this chancellor live in?
After her uneasy, indifferent-sounding and content-poor speech at the General Debate of the Federal Parliament, we must state: not here - not in this country, which she should, after all, manage.
To the reluctance to focus too much on foreign policy, Angela Merkel responded in a rather arrogant manner.
That’s provincial, she said, showing she doesn’t want to understand what the critics are talking about.
In the House of Commons, she clearly showed everyone how much she deserved the reprimand.
Merkel did not even feel a real interest, let alone a feeling for the problems in the country.
Instead, Angela “Cloud” presented herself: a politician who excels over others, who flees to foreign policy and even there expresses herself only vaguely.
For example, climate protection: it constantly praises the conclusions of the summit in Heiligendamm, but no longer says how the given climate goals should be achieved in Germany.
And all in all, such self-glory - so much modesty would have forgiven the CDU president two years ago.
Now she is limited to flat phrases that could increase her popularity among people.
With this approach, he damages his image of a pragmatist who does not need to flatter because he solves problems.
But in Angela's "Cloud" empire, internal political problems are a fringe issue.
Child poverty and the concerns of low-wage people?
There are a few minor comments on these topics.
It is worth noting how often Merkel, when it comes to child support, cries out.
Merkel has to start three times from the beginning in order to be able to pronounce at least partially the right sentence.
As soon as things start to get too specific, she stumbles like in a completely foreign terrain.
the Attack Department
The debate between the Republican presidential candidates on YouTube, in the case of Rudy Giuliani’s and Mitt Romney’s favorites, was sparked by a heated debate — and both now have to fear an outsider candidate.
The tension between the two candidates is already evident on the first topic.
Mitt Romney accuses his rival Rudy Giuliani of making New York a “refugee for illegal immigrants.”
Giuliani responds quickly with harsh remorse: "I think his own house was just one such refuge," he replies, presuming to the former Massachusetts governor that he was privately employing undocumented immigrants.
Since the Republican base still doesn't have a clear favorite, eight presidential candidates are using these debates on CNN primarily to discredit their opponents, and the only thing they can do is to get rid of them.
The half-minute videos recorded by Internet users and sent via YouTube serve only as such help on a key topic.
“This is exactly the kind of isolationist policy that we have allowed Hitler to seize power,” John McCain told his opponent, Ron Paul, who is the only one who is pushing for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Iraq.
Vietnam’s veteran McCain doesn’t spare even Romney with his remorse for refusing to condemn the torturous interrogation method called “Waterboarding,” which simulates heating.
The reaction of the public in St. Petersburg, Florida, shows that neither the war in Iraq nor the methods of torture are among the important topics of the campaign.
The audience is applauded whenever conservative values are praised and future tax increases are rejected.
This will show where the weaknesses of both favorites lie.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney explained, pleading with the party base and the television audience to forgive him for having supported abortions back in 1994.
Giuliani is embarrassed to express himself to the literal interpretation of the Bible.
Musharraf reigns in civilian power for the first time
The day after his resignation from the post of army chief, Pakistani ruler Musharraf took the presidential oath.
This marks the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Parviz Musharraf took the oath of office on Thursday and will remain in office for another five years.
Pakistani television broadcast live the ceremony, which took place at the presidential palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and strive for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he handed over his office as commander-in-chief to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani, subjecting him to international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after taking power in a bloodless military coup, the former general reigns for the first time as the civilian head of state.
By resigning from the position of commander-in-chief of the armed forces, Musharraf fulfilled one of the main demands of the opposition and the West.
Another central demand is the lifting of the state of emergency declared by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, Musharaf will cancel the state of emergency soon after his swearing-in, thus fulfilling another of the West’s demands.
The country’s highest court, which Musharraf seized from his pro-life lawyers after declaring a state of emergency in early November, last week rejected all objections to the controversial re-election of the head of state on October 6.
Meanwhile, five soldiers were killed in an attack on a military convoy in the tribal area of North Waziristan, and four others were injured.
An army spokesman said the bomb exploded on a road near the border with Afghanistan.
Krautrock's father is back
The famous German band of the seventies is playing again. Three members of the group Harmonia took their electronic synthesizers again at a concert in Berlin.
Revival will also include Live 1974, the cut from the band's most successful period.
At the time, they were much better known abroad.
The announced sensation then consists in the performance of three seated gentlemen, who at first look as if they were just enjoying dinner.
Everyone has a box, cables and, above all, buttons in front of them.
Thirty-six-year-old Dieter Moebius sits in the middle in a snow-white shirt.
On his left is a 15-year-old Michael Rother, who has a laptop and a guitar in front of him.
Thirty-seven-year-old Hans-Joachim Roedelius, who is focused on the synthesizers, is on the right from the point of view of the audience.
Everyone contributes sounds, sometimes even beats.
Sometimes, of course, by inadvertently, a traditional song is formed.
The musicians don't seem to mind that much.
Among the lovers of Krautrock, the revival of the band Harmonia caused a considerable upheaval.
One thing is worth noting here. Repeated questions have shown that although this name is part of the collective awareness of pop, it is certainly not so rushed that this band has been sorely missed for twenty-three years.
But why couldn’t even the German celebrate his still-living legends from the seventies?
And especially when you value the musical style, mistakenly called krautrock, in England and America more than in your own country.
When in 2003 the music business awarded the remaining members of the Cologne-based group Can the Echo Award for Lifetime Achievement, the hall was full of questioning views from German pop fans.
In addition, when the Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked La D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf and Neu! in their speech, the surprise of the audience no longer knew the boundaries.
Michael Rother later performed with the Red Hot Chili Peppers on stage as their old friend.
The problem of ignorance at home and worship abroad is one thing.
By recalling the band Harmonia, we unnecessarily overload the memory, this trio existed for only two years and even at that time did not have as much influence as others attributed to them later.
Moebius and Roedelius had previously played with the artist Conrad Schnitzler under the promising name Cluster.
Initially, they played in the cellar of the Schaub<0xC3><0xBC>hne theatre in Berlin.
Then in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf, for economic reasons, at a record company run by a church.
Rother briefly helped with Kraftwerk, but gained a reputation as a guitarist for Neu!, which was perhaps the most radical German band at the time.
In 1973 Rother followed the musicians of the Cluster band into exile in Forst, Weserbergland.
There, in the Old Weserhof, the ruins of the 16th century, lived as members of the commune who fled the city.
They did not live here as ideologically as in Commune I, where Roedelius was still allowed to walk as a nanny.
Rather, it was a life in such a Spitzwegian artistic being.
The name for the art is allegedly derived from the name of the choir Harmonia Ottenstein, whose badge was allegedly found in the trash can.
A lot of that harmony has been preserved.
The first album was called "Music from Harmony" and the next "De Luxe".
Although their music sounded so calm and modest, the band suffered from financial difficulties.
Collecting grapes was not only a matter of self-knowledge.
The now released CD "Live 1974" was reportedly cut in front of a record-breaking small, barely fifty-piece backdrop during a concert in Griessem.
At that time, Rothera expressed the wish that the members of the Harmony should be excommunicated and exercised occasionally.
For Roedlia and Moebia, this was a completely inappropriate request.
In 1975, the band announced their departure.
Rother ended up in the esoteric sphere and secured his future with the album Burning Heart.
The Cluster band came back to life in the 1980s and has since been more successful than Harmonia has ever been.
We can be grateful to Herbert Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nemeyer for his live album from Griessemer.
His recording company Gr<0xC3><0xB6>nland aimed to provide krautrock as an original German contribution to live music.
The band Neu! was considered Roedeli's solo work at the time.
The physical resurrection of Harmony will take place in the Berlin House of World Cultures.
Performances within the Woldtronics festival will be publicly sponsored.
Brit, Julian Cope, old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler" will be present.
The founder of Love Parade, Dr. Motte, will also participate.
In doing so, we planned the overall breadth of Krautrock’s influence on future pop music.
The empty seat of the famous group will be filled by Harmony.
Brian Ena's string, accompanied by the strangest sounds, floats in the hall: "The only real music, it belongs to the future."
There are paintings on which there is a producer with Harmony in a peasant's seat.
The creation of the legend also contributes to the projection of other black-and-white photographs, on which the set of devices are wildly connected cables.
Before that, the three veterans were once again busy improvising.
No more gluing the microphones to the organs and drums, so that the never-before-heard self-made tones are out of the instruments.
Today, electronic music looks like electronic music.
Three tech-savvy pointers.
This is not the case with the House of World Cultures.
Under the leadership of Barbara Morgenstern, she whispers under the sound clouds and in one beautiful place she emphatically sings "Aaaaaaa!"
Krautrock has always been a very English term.
It was never about rock.
We would find roots rather than in the blues in music schools (Can), in technology (Kraftwerk) or in escape from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
The one who shouts "'68" in this place is not so far from the truth, but Harmony will not let herself be led out of peace even now.
Even the most obvious thing is to think carefully about the scene.
Where does the music begin and when does it end?
This question either prepares a person for nerves or allows him to experience fleeting moments of happiness.
Richard Gere is not cynical.
With the release of the films The Hunting Party and M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden, two films about the war in the Balkans appeared.
But not one of them is convincing.
The film's premise either places too much emphasis on action and shooting, or it's too moving.
The Hunting Party won't stop an actor like Richard Gere.
Good news first: War criminals Karad<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still hiding in the mountains of the Balkans, but there, in the gloomy backdrop of the Bosnian War, actor Richard Gere finds himself.
Recently, we have lost sight of this most beautiful man of the eighties, not only because he played many lovely, unimportant roles in cool female films, but in connection with his press conferences forever on the subject of Buddhism, a man will take a liking to another film with this actor.
And yet Richard Gere is suddenly the most powerful argument for watching The Hunting Party - Where the Hunter Becomes a Trap (Why must the names of films these days be so long and tangled?).
His war reporter Simon Hunt is basically what Gere could have become if fate and the film industry hadn’t been so merciful: a man who has his best years behind him, but as a piece of junk, he still has a remarkable legacy.
But despite this trump, The Hunting Party, along with the German film M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden, is also entering cinemas this week, just by continuing an endless series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
With the film M<0xC3><0xB6>rderischer Frieden we can make a short process: this film is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who rescue a Serbian girl from a Kosovo sniper, whereupon one of them falls in love with her.
Although it is commendable that the Serbs are not presented here as the cause of all evil, this TV-thin film turns into shooting and action too soon.
The film will have something very similar to the Cobra 11 series, without the highway, but for the war.
The film The Hunting Party offers a detailed overview of why a really good film has not been made about the Balkan War so far.
The story of three U.S. war reporters posing as "the fox," a Serbian top war criminal, could perhaps become a new "Apocalypse" at a different time and under the guidance of another director and screenwriter (here's both Richard Shepard).
After all, both stories are surprisingly similar: small groups go to the forest to do something that the army is not able to do, but their path becomes a path to madness.
One of the reasons for the failure of The Hunting Party is that Simon Hunt is not the sentimental cynic introduced at the beginning.
On the contrary, the template will also prescribe for him a romantic affair with a later murdered Bosnian Muslim woman.
The film The Hunting Party can be written off with final validity after the reporters in the last five minutes of the film will be guided by what NATO, the CIA and all the hunters of the world’s criminals have failed in the last five years: to catch the criminals and leave him with the just revenge of the Bosnian Muslims.
This is so contrary to the logic of filmmaking that it would be worth turning to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
The film has a profound human message.
It condemns the fact that Karad<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still at large, and suspects the Americans and the French (here they are exceptionally united) that they are not pursuing the persecution sufficiently intensively on the basis of secret political agreements.
But good and evil are sometimes so similar that women think of Brecht’s famous poem.
It is a wooden mask of an Asian demon on the writer's desk: "I look with compassion at the swollen veins on my forehead, remarking: how hard it is to be evil.".
In movies like The Hunting Party, there are just such bumpy heads that indicate how hard it is to be good.
This problem is not limited to the topic of war in the Balkans.
Recently, it was reported in these newspapers that all Hollywood films about Iraq were great failures.
The only thing that can be added to this is that no good film about South Africa has ever been made.
Almost always the case: When a star stumbles across a crisis area or walks through a minefield, a film like Rangoon with Patricia Arquette, The Boundary of Breaking Up with Angelina Jolie, or Blutdiamanten with Leonard DiCapri will be made.
Maybe all these conflicts are just too close in time.
After all, it took decades for Hollywood to make a good film about the Holocaust – Schindler’s List.
Many films must have matured - films that are now considered classic Vietnamese works - "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse" or "The Lead Vest" - were by no means celebrated as masterpieces at the time.
But perhaps today, when every mass murder at home immediately appears on two screens, we know too much about the conflicts of this world.
Writers, on the other hand, do not have the ability to tell good stories flawlessly.
"To be or not to be" or "The Great Dictator" became so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin did not yet know how terrible the Nazi regime really was.
Maybe you don’t want to be good when you want to make good movies.
Perhaps he must form a sarcasticly measured artistic outlook as novelist Lawrence Norfolk.
When asked about the parallel between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re's Dictionary" and "The Balkan War", he stated: "The resemblance lies only in the fact that some things never change.
Big cities will always be very dangerous, people will always be killed in a terrible way, and there will always be war in Yugoslavia.”
Von Beust criticises Olympic renunciation
The mayor's resignation from hosting the Summer Olympics in Hamburg has come under fierce criticism from politics and the economy.
Many want to continue to fight for the organization of games by the water.
Von Beust, however, encourages realism in the estimation of chance.
Hans-J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Schmidt-Trenz, chief executive of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday that the decision was "unfortunate from a business point of view".
No other project in the city has recently aroused as much motivation as the Olympic idea.
"Without this goal, it would not be possible to maintain this sporting political enthusiasm to such a high degree."
Schmidt-Trenz urged the Senate not to bury this project, but to create a new long-term concept for him, "which is based on a changed timetable."
Mayor Ole von Beust stayed on Wednesday with his earlier statements that Hamburg’s Olympic ambitions are unrealistic until at least 2028.
"Not Hamburg, but the German Olympic Sports Union will decide on the Olympic candidacy," von Beust told the WELT ONLINE newspaper.
He pointed out that at the beginning of December the Sports Union will decide on the candidacy of Munich for the winter games in 2018.
"This preference for us means that with a time plan for 2028, we have no realistic chance."
But the dream is not over, Von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Association (HSB) called von Beust's statements regrettable.
The impression is that Hamburg does not want to run for the Olympic Games in the next twenty-five years.
"It is too early to destroy the chance by calling the plans buried at this early stage," HSB President G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Ploss said on Wednesday.
To deny the application would be contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate, which he made at the General Assembly of the German Higher Education Sports Union.
Von Beust did not announce Hamburg's candidacy for the University in 2015 as a replacement for hosting the Olympic Games.
The Hamburg University Sports Association only nominated a candidate city in the past week.
The SPD faction in the Hamburg Senate said it was wasting valuable time that could be used to build apartments in Hamburg.
"The development of the Klein Grasbrook area has been stalled by the Senate for years because it has staked on the organization of the Olympics and excluded the construction of apartments," SPD MPs Carola Veit and Jan Quast said.
While the SPD for the Klein Grasbrook area was still planning the Olympics with the entire area being later used for residential purposes, the CDU unanimously bet on the "Olympic factor".
Applying for the 2012 Summer Olympics in Hamburg was a huge boost to his time there.
Hamburg, however, collapsed in Leipzig.
It's not Warhol's box.
The one who combines the terms Sweden and wooden boxes does not think of Andy Warhol, but of Ikea.
Or is it?
Wooden boxes currently manufactured in Sweden throw Warhol’s works of dark shadow onto the list.
Most of his list of ninety-four “Brillo boxes” of the Stockholm type are counterfeits.
After the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" a few months ago expressed doubts about the authenticity of the Warhol "Brillo boxes" from 1968, the internal research of the Museum Moderna Museet in Stockholm comes with a result that brought disappointment; six "Brillo boxes" that in 1995 donated to the Museum Moderna Museet
Previous events are a confused, confusing chain of artistic and curatorial events.
Warhol made his first Brillo boxes in New York in 1964, painted wooden boxes that were based on the red-blue design of Brillo soap powder paper boxes.
The exhibition of his works in the Moderna Museet in 1968 showed - with Warhol's consent - hundreds of Brillo boxes made of cardboard. These did not come (for financial reasons) from Warhol, but were delivered directly from the Brillo factory.
It was not about artworks, but about their templates, just exhibition pieces.
Warhol apparently also gave permission in 1968 to make several wooden Brillo beds in Sweden, but they are not on display at the Moderna Museet.
The then witnesses now speak of fifteen boxes that rightfully entered the art and auction history as authorized originals - "Andy Warhol's Brillo Boxy" with the designation Type Stockholm.
Some of them were auctioned for more than $100,000.
The problem now is that the legendary museum director Pontus Hultén later falsely claimed that in 1968 about a hundred beds were manufactured and exhibited in Sweden, which Warhol then left to him.
In fact, 105 Hultén beds were made in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> for the exhibition in St. Petersburg only in 1990.
At that time, Warhol was already three years after his death.
Lars Bystr<0xC3><0xB6>m, the top conservator of the Moderna Museet, explored in addition to the six Brillo boxes owned by the museum, also three Brillo boxes from the Swedish private collection, two of which were made in Sweden in 1968 and after their plywood panels were painted on the base of the bricks, the bricks were painted on the base.
From the structure of the copies from 1990, on the contrary, it was revealed that the paint was applied without a previous basecoat directly to the plywood board - in addition, it is an acrylic and not an oil paint.
"These boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from Warhol's official Brillo boxing list," said Moderna Museet director Lars Nittve: "If the Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board in New York does not come to any other conclusions, Modern's musts will be removed from its materials."
As early as July, the Authentication Board announced that it would deal with these “core allegations” that have been raised in the case of soap powder boxes.
However, the organization remains in inexorable silence.
Rebel Troops in Manila Surrender
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers who had broken into a hotel in Manila demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
Riot leader Antonio Trillanes, who denounced the president's manipulation and corruption in the election, told reporters at the hotel that he rejected responsibility for the bloodshed.
Soldiers loyal to the government had previously attacked the hotel with tear gas.
A few hours earlier, about two dozen soldiers had fortified themselves in the building.
On Thursday, about half of them were on trial for a failed coup attempt in 2003, including Trillanes.
He took advantage of the negotiations to escape with about 30 of his sympathizers.
The military police, who were supposed to be guarding him, apparently ran over to his side and joined the rebellion.
They entered the Peninsula Hotel and demanded the resignation of President Gloria Macapagal Arroy.
The government of the loyal units closed the area around the selected hotel.
The president called an emergency meeting of the security cabinet.
National Security Adviser Norberto Gonzales condemned the act of the soldiers.
"People have had enough," Triallnes said.
"We're calling on people to join us."
General Danilo Lim, commander of the former elite Scout Rangers unit, said more troops would join the march in a short time.
Critics of the government have called for a major demonstration against the president on Friday.
Her government has been plagued by corruption for months.
Manila's financial district became the main scene of a rebellion in 2003 of about 200 soldiers against Arroy.
Because the insurgents refused to join the army, the insurgency collapsed after less than 24 hours.
Since 1986, at least seven attempts have been made in the Philippines to overthrow the democratically elected government.
United Internet becomes the majority shareholder of Versatel
United Internet has secured more than a 20 percent stake in Versatel.
The company announced on Wednesday that the average price per share is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14.46.
The company now owns 20.05 % of the share capital.
Previously, there was speculation about the takeover.
The company is still counting on the possibility of further increasing its stake in Versatel.
United Internet has announced that it is seeking to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL market in this step.
After Berenberg increased its stake in the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf-based network operator by a further 5 % to 15,1 %, the entry agreements appeared on Wednesday.
In the financial market, it is said that this monetary institution holds shares only for a third party.
Yesterday, United Internet had a nearly 10% stake in Drillisch, a mobile telecommunications network provider.
As part of the capital increase, Drillisch sold an additional 17.4 million new shares worth EUR 106.4 million.
Of these, 5.15 million shares were purchased by United Internet for 31.4 million euros.
The companies discussed together marketing cooperation in the field of DSL products and mobile networks.
"We are strengthening our partnership," a United Internet spokesperson explained.
In order to take over the competing Freenet, the companies jointly set up the SME Joint Undertaking.
United Internet announced on Thursday that the two companies will be satisfied with a stake of more than 10% in Freenet and will not use their right to take over an additional 18.49 percent of the company.
It is believed that the companies have so far kept all options open, especially the possibility of further increasing their stake in Freenet AG.
Talks between United Internet and Freenet over the strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This months-long and hard-to-find game about Freenet is part of the consolidation of the German telecommunications market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million contract customers on the mobile network and 1.27 million customers with a complete or DSL connection.
Holding United Internet and Drillische have so far held a 6.01% stake in Freenet.
It has now been agreed that Drillisch will receive an additional 4%.
The right to buy 18.49 % of the investment company Vatas was agreed in August.
