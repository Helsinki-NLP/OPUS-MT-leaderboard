This not only confirms that there were at least some dinosaurs that had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, it also provides details that fossils in general cannot, such as the color and the three-dimensional arrangement.
. Scientists say that this animal's plumage was chestnut-brown at the top with a light or carrot-colored underside.
The findings also provide insight into the development of feathers in birds.
Because the dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called a feather shaft, but have other characteristics from feathers - rays and bis jets - the researchers inferred that feather shafts were likely a later evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the removed suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or for decoration. The researchers believed that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows an adult plumage and not a chicken's down.
The researchers believe that the sample from the tail of the young dinosaur shows an adult individual's plumage and not a chicken's down.
A car bomb detonated at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

They found that the sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system turned out to be driven by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was designed to simulate observations of the SagDEG galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be the result of tidal-like forces between the galaxy’s dark matter and the Milky Way’s dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on Earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way exerts a force on the galaxy SagDEG.
The researchers could conclude that the dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most dark matter around a galaxy is found around the galaxy in a kind of ring and consists of lots of small particles.
Television reports show that white smoke is coming from the power plant.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
He said in an interview that the new variant was "very worrisome and that there was cause for alarm due to its very high mortality."
Some patients may have received the virus at the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital health personnel.
In a year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire human group that has tuberculosis still seems low; 6,000 of the total 330,000 infected people in South Africa at any given time.

By day they are cooler than the surrounding surface, and by night they are warmer.
Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey’s (USGS) Astrogeology Team and Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona said: “Their thermal behavior indicates that they are fairly deep holes in the Earth, even though they do not behave as stable as large holes on Earth that often maintain a fairly constant temperature around the clock.”
In France, voting has traditionally been low-tech: voters isolate themselves in a box and place a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their choice of candidate in an envelope.
Once officials have verified the voter’s identity, the voter places the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
The procedure is codified very precisely in French electoral law.
Voting hours have been transparent since 1988, so that voters and observers can see that the ballots do not contain ballots at the start of the vote, and that no ballots are added other than those that are correctly counted and come from approved voters.
Candidates can send representatives as witnesses to all parts of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision and following specific procedures.

Her first was a slalom, where she did not finish her first race. 36 of the 116 participants got the same result in the race.
In her second race, which was a great slalom, she finished in tenth place in the women's sitting group with a total run time of 4:41.30. 2:11.60 minutes slower than the woman in first place, Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gy<0xC3><0xB6>ngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished in ninth place.
Four skiers in the women's group of seated athletes did not complete the race, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the Grand Slalom did not rank in the race.
Police in Madhya Pradesh found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and we have found her mobile phone and laptop".
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhuta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused met in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious injuries to his head.
The road where the accident took place was temporarily closed, while rescue services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been indicted in Edinburgh Sheriff Court for murdering his son.
She is in custody and is awaiting prosecution and trial, but evidence from eyewitnesses may be flawed because her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish courts operate differently, and the courts have considered the publication of images to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee comments that "it seems determined that journalists should beware if they publish photos of suspects, etc."
Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment is available.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border conflict that Palestine wants based on the borders from before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other topics covered reportedly include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, as well as the problems surrounding the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years when an agreement has been signed, while the Palestinian authorities only agree to leave the valley for five years.
Shooters in the supplementary pest control trial had to be closely monitored by the park officers as the trial was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of conservation and cultural heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety and training instruction.
A new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) was sworn in yesterday by Martelly.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the former CEP’s resignation was recommended by a presidential commission as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
Martelly’s response to the widespread anti-regime protests, which began in October, was the commission.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by a lack of elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
In about 60 reported cases, defective iPods have been overheated, causing a total of six fires and giving four people less burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the units.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of an additional 34 cases of overheating, which the company called “non-serious.”
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "quite regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands’ emergency department said no damage had been reported to the nation.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken tourists from Hong Kong as hostages by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 against the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages including children and the elderly were released early and so were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot down.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He received his education as an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at Auckland’s National Women’s Hospital.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching early births in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was given, it would accelerate the development of the baby's lungs in the fetal stage.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black box" plane recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, like herself. Strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was as wild as me...maybe even more...love her and will miss her...hopefully she's a better place now."
Of the 1,400 people polled ahead of the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has grown by 8 percent since 2008.
Constituent Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia’s last monarch.
In the different extremes of the vote, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was to swim in the style of 100 m and 200 m free and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints there have been doubts about his condition.
He could not take the medication necessary to combat his pain, as these are prohibited under the doctors.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed this discovery in early February using different hardware and software, and on Tuesday it was announced.
Comets may have been a source of water on Earth along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and especially how Earth was formed since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month that legalized same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumours as "political nonsense and stupidity".
I wonder if he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, allows aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel a year and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike older radar-based technology on Earth, to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation is put in and the above ground trains will not stop in Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride options will not be available on the ground.
The fear of missing transport raised the possibility that one would be forced to play the game behind closed doors without the team’s fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species was developed in just two generations, although this process was thought to have taken much longer due to mating between the endemic Darwin-fin geospiza fortis and the invasive cactus-finza geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be pulled out to a thin cable, which can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into plates.
It can be made very thin and put on other metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called a chemical's pH value. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color, depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH value is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical.
Brintions are protons that have their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Shake the two dry powders together and then press them together into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system in almost every house.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women stayed together in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in the room receives the call and reflects it back down almost immediately.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
Putting a satellite or a telescope into space requires a giant rocket that is over 100 feet tall.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is that it has given us much easier and faster methods of transport.
It has given us the train, the car and many other means of transport.
Among them, there are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) that eat the far more numerous small prey animals such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is a concept of the niche, a special task each cat has that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats and live in large groups called flocks.
The herds consist of one to three related adult males as well as up to thirty females and cubs.
The females are usually closely related to each other and are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion flocks react much like wolves or dogs in flocks, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete who can climb (though not well), swim, jump far and pull by five times the strength of a strong person.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of a lion, but sounds more like a sentence of touching, shouted words.
Ozelottes prefer small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they have the opportunity. Almost all the animals that the ozelotte hunts are much smaller than it itself.
Scientists believe that ozelottes follow and find animals to eat (swap) via smell, sniffing at where they have been on earth.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they also move very quietly around. Ozelottes chase their prey by walking in one with their surroundings and then throwing themselves over their prey.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) is separated from the main population they came from (like if they move across a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they can’t easily move back), they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs to have different functions or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it had previously been needed.
The original population has not changed at all; it still needs the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new environment, they begin to resemble the rest of the population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process of species formation, which simply means the formation of new species. Species are an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that people inhale, and they absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses out of plants and make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the top of the food chain in its time, so it feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than 70 razor-sharp teeth and an extra set at the top of its mouth, meaning there was no escape route for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything that came into the water. Even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex would not be able to stand up to it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans ate some strange or unusual things, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a seven-seater.
Another difference was that while the poor and the women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the rich men might like to have big feasts together where they lay on their side while eating.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained food that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built each of their gods a primary temple, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Sometimes pyramid-shaped towers, so-called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Jewish family lived most of their lives outdoors.
Women made the food in the yard; the shops were just open disks facing the street. Stones were used to build houses with.
There were no large forests in Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
In the Nordic sagas it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, there were already Inuit tribes living in the area at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a tax card is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a tax card.
Written on the back of the U.S. Declaration of Independence was the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document when it is turned on its head.
Although no one knows with any guarantee who wrote it, it is known that early in its life the large parchment document (it measures 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches x 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it is likely that the remark was merely appended as an addendum.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
It was ruled by the French Vichy government - there are French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied troops invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were focusing on Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a larger, significant group of people who live together and collaborate, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city state; and it also somehow defines the size of society.
Urban states are the forerunners of nations. A civilizational culture involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, long-term cultural influence, and fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, and are not recognized as real civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government—with Congress as the only component—under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, they were dependent on the state authorities, who often did not cooperate to enforce all actions.
It also had no right to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required unanimous acceptance from all states before they could be changed, and the states took on the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, together with Germany's national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and became the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to from a geographical point of view as an "island group"
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing the island named the Ilha Formosa or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, which initiated a change in the original grain production practices, and employed Chinese workers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty troops (1644–1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and in 1885 declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after a defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it relinquished sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Temple with the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and excavations continue to this day.
For example, the most common photography format in the world is for still images 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has been inherited from sensor formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, which can seem confusing, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio for this format is therefore 3:2 (divided by twelve to achieve the simplest integer ratio).
Many common formats (e.g. APS formats) are similar to or close to this image format.
The very abused and often ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a certain order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main motif is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in the history of Europe, the Catholic Church became wealthy and influential.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion united European countries in spite of different languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power influenced everyone from king to ordinary citizens.
One of the most important Christian dogmas is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church’s financial resources should be used specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this dogma was properly lived up to.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain launched a blockade at sea against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective and prevented important military and civilian supplies from reaching, in contravention of the recognized international laws codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sections of the sea, which was a danger even to neutral ships.
As there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to the country’s unlimited submarine war.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations' attitudes were leaning against pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of the war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to work at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents on him, a collection of poems and a written recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his former job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different time periods were shown in a unique way; each Chinese time period or each family in power was a distinct dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the era of three kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between Han and Jin dynasty.
During these periods, there was fierce war between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The period of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died in the struggle to sit in the highest seat of the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the use of the meter system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not one ruler.
Even after the revolution, the professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to do well.
The same applies to the military, because instead of class-based ranking in the army, the ranking was now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working class people from other countries to start their own internal revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond worldly life. He used to visit a cave known as the "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) to immerse himself in his thoughts.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad’s spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find at all, even if you know that it exists. When you are inside the cave, it is a total isolation.
Only the clear beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains can be seen. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard inside from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza necropolis" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (of which the world-famous Great Pyramid is the largest of them all), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The "up-bow" label is similar to a V and the "down-bow" label is similar to a staple, or a square that lacks its lower side.
Up means you have to start at the tip and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the seed (where your hand is holding the bow) and pull the bow.
Upstrokes usually produce a softer sound, while downstrokes sound stronger and more powerful.
You can always insert your own markings, but keep in mind that the inscribed arc markings are determined for musical reasons, which is why they should usually be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Mrs Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on 6 October 1789 by a mob of market women.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a screaming group of people shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their chariot completely open.
At one point, a member of the mob presented the head of a royal guard who was killed at Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
The Philippines had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial power to raise money for most of the expenses, and bond yields ran through the banks on Wall Street in the name of the government.
Of course, the superprofits of the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the fundamental gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one has to understand the context underlying the founding of the Order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, the part of European history that took place in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention end around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is an expression that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice from technology as a driving force or technological necessity, to a narrow idea that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic that is connected to scientific laws, as well as the way in which they are embodied in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a route largely outside of cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has an "impact" on societies that are hereditary and not socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the motor-driven car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
But a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
When many people own cars, there are also more accidents on the roads, which leads to inventions of new techniques in the field of health to heal body injuries.
Romanticism contained a major element of cultural determinism, derived from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, it was geography that shaped the individual, and over time customs and cultures that were related to geography arose, and these were in harmony with the location of society and were therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is today known as the mother capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the mother capital of feudal Europe.
It is known to be an epicenter of luxury since about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, mainly because crusaders had returned with gifts such as silks and spices that had a greater value than what the Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at that time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was most prevalent in the period between the 10th-11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the clothes were largely inspired by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, as a result of the slow communication channels, Western styles could lag behind by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to attach clothes to.
Subsistence farming is farming carried out for the production of sufficient food to simply meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers have been involved in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel overlooked by societal standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be characteristic because of the age, ethnic background, social class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that regulate a subculture as being distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of several factors.
People belonging to a subculture often signal their affiliation through a clear and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases where children through failure, accident or intentional neglect have not been socialized by adults in their childhood.
Such children are called "wilderness" or savages. Some wilder children have been deprived of liberty by humans (most often their own parents); in some cases, this childishness was caused by the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical impairments.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or ran away.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in nature on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) that is almost identical to the animal that has shown care for the child, such as its fear or lack of interest in humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Placement is not a learning method, but a support for people who need to learn new things - for example, using a new computer program or starting a project.
Stillages can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but it is the little paper clip man in Microsoft Office as well.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized in the software, and aims to question, ask for, and explain procedures that may have been too challenging for the student to handle alone.
Children come into foster families for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment without nutrition, care and education, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safety zone for these children.
Our family care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
A foster family is tasked with providing all necessities that were not present in the home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of use and access to content.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998), as they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the understanding of microexpressions, which are facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can identify whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting micro-expressions.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks indicated how people who are unable to understand speech due to a brain injury are nevertheless able to assess sincerity with great accuracy.
He even believes that such abilities for the interpretation of human behavior can also be found in pets such as dogs.
Research from the twentieth century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: the invisible and the visible.
New genetic variation is added via mutation, and it is removed from the pool of exact variations via selection."
Separation and recombination mix the variation back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like man to satisfy his need for amino acids from available plant sources.
In addition, there are serious consequences of non-compliance: reduced growth, malnutrition and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins that exist in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, these are difficult to digest unless they are prepared.
Conversely, animal feed (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest. It also provides large amounts of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not surprise us if our own ancestors solved their “protein problem” in much the same way that chimpanzees on the savannah do today.
Sleep disorder is the process of consciously waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you find that you turn off the clock while you sleep, you can place it at the other end of the room, forcing you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) prior to sleep, forcing one to get up and charge the water.
The amount of inner calm that a person possesses is quite the opposite of the amount of tension that a person possesses in body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vitality. All people have the potential to find absolute calm and satisfaction.
Everyone can learn to understand. The only thing that stands in the way of achieving this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was expanded by the path of love Mahayana and with a lot of techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened to life (enlightenment energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. When the war ended, the differences in the countries' system, process and culture led the countries to oppose each other.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies now became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought seriously by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defence was already broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army invaded and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading both the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Polish-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of both people and goods across the seas.
The task of the Navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country continues to have the ability to move your people and your goods, while at the same time affecting your enemy’s ability to move his people and his goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to transport soldiers and materials across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain like the rest of Europe.
As far as we know, goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to hold them so that they could have easy access to milk, fur, meat and skin.
Hostages were generally kept in flocks that wandered on hills or other pastures, often monitored by shepherds who were often children or teenagers, corresponding to the more commonly known shepherds. These shepherding methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, carriageways were built in England.
Although the carriageways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they meant that horses could pull heavier loads faster than on the slightly more uneven roads of the time.
Swellers were invented quite early to keep the tracks in place, but eventually it was realized that tracks would be more effective if they had an iron piece on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the cars.
In 1767, the first rails were used, which were made entirely of metal.
The first known method of transportation was walking, humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors Australopithecus did not usually go upright.
There are two-legged specializations in Australopithecus fossils that are 4.2-3.9 million years old, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is in many cases like treating symptoms. But if we do not just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and problems have become greater because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of man.
After Congress passed it on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by Congressional President John Hancock, and Secretary Charles Thomsen was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which is now known as "Dunlap broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8 in Independence Hall's courtyard.
One of them was sent to George Washington on 6 July, and on 9 July he had it read out to his soldiers in New York. On 10 August, a copy reached London.
The 25 Dunlap sheets, which still exist, are the oldest surviving version of the document. The original handwritten version no longer exists.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and still live. We call them birds.
Most people don’t see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
There are many things about birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits, to use computer language now.
Internal poisoning may not be visible immediately. Symptoms of vomiting are too general for a diagnosis to be made immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open drug container or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal description of this group of insects.
This expression comes from ancient knowledge of wall lice, which are insects that largely live as parasites on humans.
Both roe deer and bed bugs are nestless, meaning they are adapted to live in their host’s house or nest.
Across the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the largest neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system consisting of the brain, spinal cord and the optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not best for them or their child that they have a baby.
It is possible for these couples to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can take them over.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. This method is actually used in most scientific studies.
However, it does not stand alone, experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to remove one or more possible hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations also leads to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek disappeared, the West felt cut off from its Greek roots in philosophy and science.
Many of the observations made in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and natural, biological production.
Periodic rhythms, which are not reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living beings such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-driving oscillators that will continue a period of free-running cycles, even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They made two experiments in which they marked either the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape as well as plant and animal life.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits as well as studies of ecosystem information.
An example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Where tomorrow people leave small villages by car to go to their workplace, and are passed by others whose workplaces are the place they have just left.
On this dynamic transport ferry, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
The decarbonized economy has detached the biosphere from the stable phase that has supported human development for a few million years, science now believes.
Everyone is a part of society and uses the transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear as many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is a study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, and their interaction with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flows because drivers’ behaviour cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers typically behave fairly consistently; thus, traffic is also typically fairly consistent and can be calculated mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between the three main characteristics: (1) current, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions help to plan, design and operate road systems.
Insects were the first animals to fly to weather. Their ability to fly helped them to more easily evade enemies and find food and partners more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a larger selection of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the goldsmith and the dayfly are the only insects that can not fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system was moving around the Sun.
There were shared opinions about his theory – some felt he was right, while many felt the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the earth.
It makes sense, because we can't feel the earth spinning around, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second longest river on Earth, containing over 8 times as much water as the second largest river on Earth.
The Amazon River is also the world's widest river, and is in some places up to six miles (about 9.6 km) wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows through the planet’s rivers and into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River collects water from thousands of smaller rivers, but the main river itself is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long.
Although stone pyramid construction continued until the end of the ancient kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in the size and technical expertise of their constructions.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were well and probably a thousand years old.
The population of the Vatican State is about 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world, and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican State uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used for religious ceremonies.
All inhabitants of the Vatican City State are Roman Catholic.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper since ancient times, because they are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to dig for if you have the right tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had the theory that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely, earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also had a theory that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basic mixtures of two or more metals. Do not forget that there are many substances in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period that ends this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to most people when it came out.
Unfortunately, the pencil has lost status and is used less since new writing methods have appeared.
People now write messages through computer screens and never need to get near a pencil sharpener.
You can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes up.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like pushing a heavy cart up a hill, and when the core splits again, some of the energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that they tend to collapse under little or no influence.
The surface of the moon is made of stone and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the back.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.
There may be several lunar gardens on the front, as the crust here is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered on figuring out what makes people react or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become more mature and reach adulthood.
Theories examine what it is about certain people that makes them perform certain actions, and what elements in their environment make them perform or fail to perform certain actions.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the need pyramid, and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can occur when a manager begins to lead his former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to try to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, making disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the opposite end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has accomplished and make it his or her own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team’s successes and failures.
This behavior often results in problems between the managers and the rest of the team.
There are the same expectations for expertise for virtual teams as conventional teams, but there are small differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique part of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each of the members reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and inventiveness begin to emerge when all available resources are used effectively across an organization’s functional departments.
As a result, the process in an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that meets customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture that fosters innovation as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method that can help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the research area and makes it much more accurate.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us plenty of information and materials to build simulation models with which to help us understand our mental processes.
Although artificial intelligence is often associated with science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI includes being able to manufacture machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, scheduling and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwritten recognition, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines, focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the economic, medical, engineering and military industries, as it has been built into several home computers and computer game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of any class. Quite often a teacher would love to take his students to places to which it is not possible to travel by bus.
The technology offers solutions with virtual excursions. Students can look at museum objects, visit aquariums or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing an excursion virtually is also a good way to evaluate an excursion and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students from Bennet School in North Carolina each year design a website about their trip to the state capital, and each year the website is rebuilt, but old versions are still available online as a sort of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help improve students’ writing skills. Although students often start their blogging experience with fluffy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally addresses this.
As students are often the most critical audience, the author of the blog begins to strive to improve himself in writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, "forces blogging students to become smarter on the world around them." The requirement to give the audience what they want inspires students to be wise and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; by providing active response to Internet materials, students can define their roles in relation to what others have written and describe their own perspectives on specific topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s charming, bilingual capital and has a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada’s past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the northern part is home to Muskoka and other areas’ untapped natural beauty.
All of these things as well as more highlight Ontario as what is considered genuine Canadian by outsiders.
Further north there are large areas that are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent of its own when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are connected to France and known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the country, and the religion quickly spread to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama's discovery of the Cape route between Europe and India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It makes sense to wear what might look like a wedding ring (it just shouldn’t look too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences can result in what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be persecuted, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be sure when you reject men, and don’t be afraid to say no (cultural differences or not, it’s not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to leave it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a wide variety of nips, but it is very touristy.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is located just east of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets in particular in the city center.
Despite the fact that Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated, in order to understand the battles taking place in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for ascent of the Nyiragongo volcano as well as one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle-taxa) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is <0x7E>500 Congolese francs for the short trip.
Along with the city's relative inaccessibility, it has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, remote areas.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of threatened world heritage sites due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the African World for PBS.
The city stands in sharp contrast to the rest of the country’s cities because it has a more Arabic flair than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and access fees to the park.
It can also be advantageous to buy a Wild Card, as this either gives access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all of South Africa’s national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory its name and is the place that many tourists consider the primary focus area.
The Hong Kong skyline is a group of buildings that, by their reflection in the water of Victoria Harbour, are often compared to a glittering bar chart.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon port front on the opposite side.
The majority of Hong Kong's urban development is tightly packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists made their own, so if you’re looking for evidence of the area’s colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km from the coast into Bangladesh and the hinterland of India.
Sundarbans has been added to the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest that is within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps —they include some of the last remaining growths of the mighty forests that once covered the gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water / moss areas.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengali royal tigers and about 30,000 chital deer in the area.
There are buses from the cross-regional bus station (on the other side of the river) all day long although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since the buses in the district are often full, it is a good idea to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, Japanese buses, which are both comfortable and robust.
Deltaxaer is a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby locations, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical free height under the bridge is 15 meters. The construction was completed in August 2011. It first opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaran<0xC3><0xAD>s were the most significant group of natives who lived in the area that is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also farmed to survive.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycur<0xC3><0xBA> and Payagu<0xC3><0xA1>, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Greater Province of India", was born in the 16th century as a result of the meeting between Spanish conquerors and indigenous populations.
The Spanish began the period of colonization, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve a lot of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the world’s best polo teams as well as some of the world’s best players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo courts in Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas.
Also smaller tournaments and matches can be seen here at other times of the year.
For tournament news as well as where to buy tickets, you can enquire at Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), whose value is set to the value of one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the islands located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
Generally speaking, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be applicable, although British and U.S. currency may be usable; ask the owners in advance to find out which payment method is accepted.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so be sure to exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months it is normal to have temperatures above 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely reach below freezing, but the wind and humidity together make it feel colder than what’s on the thermometer.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, you must be at least 100 yards/meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meter away from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they look, bison, moose, bears, and virtually all large animals can attack well.
Every year a lot of visitors get hurt because they do not keep proper distance. These animals are large, wild and can be dangerous, so give them space.
In addition, you should be aware that smell attracts bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or preparing food that smells, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port formed the framework of a notorious naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except for a British cruise ship, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence, which was organized by the Mau movement, there was a peaceful gathering in the city that resulted in the murder of Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is close to two ports. The most popular are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located in the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and most get natural shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are found at Waitemata port in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the sea. It is safe to swim here.
The most common local beer is "Number One", which is not a complicated beer but is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be better to transport.
It’s definitely safe to drink the local water from the tap, but it’s easy to find bottled water if you’re worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A "short black" is called "espresso", cappuccino has plenty of cream on top (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate lives up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but on the other hand excellent.
Many people visit the reef all year round, and people rarely get hurt on the reef for these reasons.
Always listen to advice from the authorities, read and follow advice on signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Seaweed occurs near beaches and near river mouths from October to April north of 1770. They can occasionally also be found outside these times.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live their active life in the sea, their primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking gives the traveler peace of mind that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have deals on specific hotels, although it may be possible for you to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also keep the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents to your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, changes or requests should be addressed to the tour operator first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of music festival participants choose to camp on site, and many participants consider it a crucial part of the experience.
If you want to be where it is going, you need to get in early to get a tent pitch close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the big stages is over, there may still be parts of the festival that play music late into the evening.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
Check where your cabin is if you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, as sailing through ice can be quite noisy for those closest to you.
Passengers on cruise ships are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions), which is nice to know as cruises to St. Petersburg give passengers time to see the city.
Casinos do everything they can to ensure that guests spend as much time and as much money as possible. Windows and clocks are usually not present and it can be difficult to find an exit.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and keep them in the house.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are offered at the expense of the house. But fullness weakens judgment, and all true gamblers know how important it is to be sober.
Anyone who needs to drive at high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice and minus degrees.
On icy and snowy roads there is low friction and you can’t drive, as you would normally do, on dry asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, and traffic flows mostly undisturbed all year round.
Safaris are the highlight of many and are perhaps the thing that attracts the most tourists to Africa.
The term safari is often used to refer to land trips to see the beautiful African wildlife, especially on the savannah.
Some animals such as elephants and giraffes tend to approach the cars, and standard equipment is therefore enough to see the animals.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes clouded, and you can better see them with a binocular.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "go-safari" or "safari on foot") consists of walks that either take a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held elsewhere in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it also hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and your accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may experience problems.
Cancellation policies vary, but from the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets to the event will cost between <0xC2><0xA5>2,500 and <0xC2><0xA5>130,000, with typical tickets costing around <0xC2><0xA5>7,000.
Ironing of damp clothes can help to dry it. Many hotels have an iron and ironing board that can be borrowed even if there is not one in the room.
If you don’t have the option to use an iron, or if you don’t like to wear socks that are worn, try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be sure to let the substance stay too hot (which can cause shrinkage or in extreme cases burns).
There are different ways to clean water where some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you’re concerned, consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they do not know from home.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in worse cases cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases in themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people, are usually not perceived as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods in certain places that are exempt from taxes and fees.
Travelers traveling to countries with a high tax rate can sometimes save significant amounts, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The line between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often runs through isolated terrain in the hinterland.
Be alert if you are not used to driving on the highway: steep hills, narrow lanes and sharp turns are plenty of.
The speed limits laid down are significantly lower than on pre- and post-route routes — typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) — and it is even more important than usual to comply with them accurately.
Strangely enough, the coverage on mobile phones is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cakes are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very tasty and varied just like in Germany’s southern neighbour, Austria.
Baking with fruit is common: apples are baked in cakes all year round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Very German pastries also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. Popular cakes and a strong cup of coffee often go hand in hand
If you fancy some small, but rich, cakes, you can try what depending on the region is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices along with either meat or vegetables.
A curry is either "dry" or "wet" depending on how much liquid is in it.
In the inner regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curry dishes. In southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a generic term that covers a wide range of regional food cultures found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without further elaboration, it typically refers to the food originally sourced from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now the Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago; it consists of a number of single spicy dishes, where the most popular spices are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet, which hang down on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can provide safety problems due to the possibility of a rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse, but has a foot trapped in the stirrup, he can be pulled with if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, some safety measures can be taken.
First, many riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety belts, which cause the stirrup straps to be detached from the saddle if they are pulled back by a falling rider.
Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley - Chile's largest climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, has a number of large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountain tops present breathtaking views from the tops to all visitors. Mountaineers from all over the world are continuously establishing new routes among its endless potential for new climbing walls.
Alpine winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports activities that involve running down snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard strapped to your feet.
Skiing is a great travel activity with many enthusiasts - sometimes known as "ski bums" who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular area.
People have been skiing for thousands of years - cave paintings all the way back from the year 5,000 BC show people standing on skis!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking on skis: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, skiing or skiing hiking.
It is related to, but usually does not involve alpine-style skiing or mountaineering. The latter is carried out in steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
You should see the ski route that was the similar hiking route.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly greater distances than if you walk – but it is only very rare that you get the same speed as on cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, a trip through several countries would mean having to review visa applications and passport control several times.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area functions as a single country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can usually cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you should not apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured goods are considered antiques. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be less in, for example, North America than in Europe.
Handmade products can be categorized as antiques, even if they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important livelihood for the Sami, and the culture around it is also important for many Sami with other occupations.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami kept reindeer in great style, but they lived by fishing, hunting and the like and mainly used the reindeer as a migratory animal.
Tourism is an important source of income in S<0xC3><0xA1>pmi, the area of the Sami people.
Although the word "gypsy" is often used especially among non-Romanians, it is often considered offensive due to the word's association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If travel instructions appear in the country you are visiting, your travel insurance or cancellation insurance may be affected.
It may also be that you want advice from governments other than your own, but their advice will be designed for their own citizens.
One example is that U.S. citizens in the Middle East may face a different situation than Europeans or Arabs.
The advice is only a brief overview of the political situation in a country.
The views expressed are often corroborated by a general and simplified view of the matter in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather conditions are the general term for all dangerous weather phenomena that can cause damage or serious social disruption or cost human lives.
Extreme weather conditions can occur all over the world, and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, extreme rainfall, and wildfires are forms of, and effects of, harsh weather like thunderstorms, tornadoes, sky pumps, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include snowstorms, mudslides, ice sheets and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of severe weather conditions that may affect their area as it may affect any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A search on the Internet for "Course in hostile environment" will probably give the address of a local company.
A course will usually cover all the topics discussed here with far more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will normally last from 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes there will be weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are common, but there are not many publications dealing with war zones.
Travellers planning sex-change operations abroad must ensure that they bring valid documents to their return journey.
The willingness of governments to cooperate varies when it comes to issuing passports of unspecified sex (X), or documents updated to give a person a desired name and gender.
The will of foreign governments to respect these documents varies equally.
Visits to security checkpoints have also become more intrusive in the period since 11 September 2001.
Transgender passengers who have not had operations should not expect to get through the scanners with their privacy and dignity intact.
The current from waves that return and break on the beach, often by a reef or equivalent, is called a countercurrent.
Because of the underwater topology, the return run is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and a rapid flow to deep water can be formed.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue by trying to swim back towards the current, which may be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the stream, it’s no more difficult than normal to swim back.
Try to aim for a place where you won’t be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you’ve been discovered, you might be able to wait for you to be rescued.
Homecoming shock comes faster than culture shock (there is not to the same extent a period of excitement over the new), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who had the ease of adapting to the new culture sometimes find it very difficult to adapt to their own culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some of your habits from your home culture.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding as they knew that a traveler in a whole new country needed to adapt.
People do not necessarily expect that it is necessary to show patience and understanding when returning home as a traveler.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting activities in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the show begins.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and sellers. The story of the sound and the light is like a history book.
The sphinx is set as a background and tells a long story.
The scenes are shown on the pyramids, and the various pyramids light up.
The South Heath Islands, discovered in 1819 and claimed by many nations, have the most bases, sixteen of which are active in 2020.
The island group is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where an active volcano's flooded caldera provides a spectacular natural harbour area.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula meet on the high plain and form the 360 km long chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which is divided into two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range features Antarctica's highest mountain, the Vinson Massif (also called Mount Vinson), which peaks at 4,892 m.
In remote areas without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a phone call.
This service is often used by shipping, including pleasure craft, as well as expeditions in need of remote data and speech.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One option that is becoming more and more popular for those planning a Sabbath year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among those who leave school as it allows them to take a year out before university without compromising on their education.
In many cases, a course abroad in your sabbatical year can actually improve your chances of getting a place at a higher education institution in your home country.
Typically, there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these training programs.
Finland is a great destination for sailors. "Land of the Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in the lakes as well as in the islets along the coast.
In the archipelagos and lakes you do not necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough for any yacht, you get another experience in a smaller boat or even a kayak.
Sailing is a national hobby in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is somewhat similar to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days, where you go back and sleep on the ship at night.
If you only go ashore with the ship’s excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruises have Berlin, Germany in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea at all and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
It can be a frightening experience to travel by plane for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have not flown before, or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the fear and hatred of other things that many people suffer from.
For some, understanding how a plane works and what happens in flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or not having control.
Delivery companies take on well paid to deliver quickly. Often time is very important when it comes to business documents, goods or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and in smaller companies there was a problem.
If they sent things by air freight, on some routes it may have taken days to get through reading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it through faster was by sending it as checked baggage. The rules of the airlines do not allow them to send luggage without a passenger. That is where you get into the picture.
The obvious way to fly in first or business class is to put a large pile of money in front of getting the opportunity (or even better, getting your business to do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a rough rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the economy-class normal price for business-class and eleven times the price for first class!
In general, there is no need to look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that certain core groups of passengers are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but which is not recognized by any member states of the United Nations.
Economic relations have been restored between these two parts of Moldova despite the breakdown in political negotiations.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey’s third-largest city with a population of about 3.7 million, the country’s second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very large transport hub.
What was once the old town of Smyrna is now a modern, developed and busy trading town situated around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass facade buildings and modern shopping malls are surrounded by traditional red brick roofs, the old market from the 18th century and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere that is more Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsv<0xC3><0xAD>k overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.

There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Do not tell jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not embarrass the place with markings or by drawing graffiti on the structures.
Barcelona's official language is Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, by far most understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
However, most signs are only given in Catalan because it has been established by law as the official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used, in public transport and other facilities.
General announcements in the metro are given only in Catalan, but unforeseen changes are communicated via an automatic system in several different languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-absorbed, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is often only an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is still to behave as nicely as possible, you need to behave like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-educated). It will make it significantly easier to get around.
The cool exterior of the Parisians evaporates quickly if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is filled with forest areas – mainly beech and coniferous trees – and offers a mix of both alpine plants and Mediterranean plants.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities due to its many microclimates, different soil types and varying altitudes.
The area is also home to an extremely large variety of animals and bird species.
Here, along with many more common species, rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, loose, wildcat and bull are found.
While visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees, while also having their shoulders covered.
Most of the monasteries have scarves for women who show up unprepared, but if you bring your own and especially some with strong colors, you get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same way, men are required to wear pants that cover their knees.
This can be borrowed from the warehouse at the entrance, but the clothes will not be washed after each use, so maybe you are not completely safe by wearing these skirts. One size fits all men!
The Mallorcan cuisine, like other similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and the use of a lot of olive oil.
A simple, popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: Bread with olive oil, tomato and any kind of available accessories such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie for you, always begin with big, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objectives

Persian has a relatively simple and mostly common grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Just so you know, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know a little Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese resembles it enough that you do not need to study it separately.
Premodern observatories are usually outdated today and remain as museums or teaching sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not such a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or on campuses where they are easier to reach than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.
Looking at flowering cherry trees, known as Hanami, has been a tradition in Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China, where flowers from flowering trees were the chosen flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, therefore, you must resist the temptation to "just take one sample".
If you visit a publicly accessible garden, you will be thrown out without discussion if you collect "samples".
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to navigate around and you can buy almost anything after you have arrived.
But when you are in the "high tropics", only a few degrees north of the equator, you need to handle both heat (all the time) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is more rare).
There are also a few buses running north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure to check if the bus you are considering taking is going into Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.

There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night to see the sunrise in a exposed place.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
The more traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil Saturday night on Easter weekend, where congregations often break out at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying or floating.
Because of the long distance from the continent, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary grass-eating animal in the Galapagos.
Since the first humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been imported such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit arctic or antarctic areas in the winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see polar lights, as the sky will be dark more or less around the clock.
Since there are not many people living in the areas, and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are standard business clothing, and colleagues appeal to each other by their surnames or job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is important and thus emphasizes group effort rather than praise for individual performance.
