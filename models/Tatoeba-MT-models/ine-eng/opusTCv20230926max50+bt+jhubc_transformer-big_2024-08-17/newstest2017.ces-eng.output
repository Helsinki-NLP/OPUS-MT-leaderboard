Twenty-eight-year-old chef found dead in shop in San Francisco
The twenty-eight-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was a local shop steps this week.
But the victim’s brother says he has no idea who would want to hurt him, adding, “He’s finally starting to get better.”
The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as an 18-year-old San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, the office of a forensic doctor said.
The San Francisco Police Department said it was a violent death and an investigation was underway.
Victim Louis Galicia’s brother for ABC’s KGO in San Francisco said Frank, who used to be a line cook in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said his death was "shocked and devastated".
"We have a small team that works as a close-knit family, and we will miss them very much," the spokesman said.
At this difficult time, our thoughts and condolences are with Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank first slept in the hostels, but that recently "he has finally started to prosper."
"He found an apartment, he went with a girl," Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he had no idea who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a kind soul and a big heart.
When he wanted to connect with his family, he always cooked us food, made us dinner,” said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in a fight.
He was a brother who took things as they are.
“Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was the uncut diamond that lit up every day,” he said.

Czech Railways has invested over 31 billion euros in the modernization of vehicles.
They also have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the past six years, state-owned carriers have invested more than CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for modernisation in individual years, with the exception of 2012, are gradually decreasing.
Over the past six years, Czech Railways has invested over CZK 31 billion in vehicle modernization.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent showed a reduction in the average age by two years for locomotives and separate units and by six years for classic cars.
A larger share of the investments put the carrier in regional transport, where about 60 percent of the money went, and 40 percent invested in the restoration of vehicles for long-distance transport.
The average age of locomotives and units is currently 19 years.
However, modernized older vehicles are counted as completely new in this indicator.
If the modernization of vehicles did not count, the average age of <0xC4><0x8C>D-powered vehicles would increase by ten years.
Slightly older are on average passenger cars, whose average age at the time of modernization is 23 years.
If only the age from the date of manufacture were taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
However, in recent years, classic sets consisting of wagons and locomotives have been gradually disappearing from the Czech and worldwide railways and are being replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, locomotives dropped from 280 to 223 units, and the number of classic cars dropped from 2,716 in 2011 to 2,132 in the middle of this year.
In particular, the carrier got rid of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking openings while driving.
From January to July, the carrier had 110 of these cars scrapped.
Of the investments that <0xC4><0x8C>D plans to make in the vehicle fleet in the near future, it is possible to indicate, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for a speed of up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework contract for the purchase of electric units for domestic speed.
The contract includes the purchase of up to 30 units of motor and 20 units of electric units.
The authorities know about illegal advertising for a quarter of a year, they can't get rid of it.
We're completely helpless, they admit.
For a quarter of a year, the online newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has been following the story of the billboard in southern Bohemia, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipno, where there is not only a touristically interesting walk in the crowns of trees, but also an Olympic park.
Motorway managers know they're standing there in the dark, but they say they can't do anything about it.
There are hundreds, maybe thousands, of similar ads all over the country.
Officials say a law is at fault that makes it impossible to remove illegal mobile billboards immediately.
First of all, a complicated bureaucratic wheel is needed.
In the meantime, the company will change its name and the office will be short.
Or just move the ad a few meters and the official process must start again.
The Directorate of Roads and Highways admitted a quarter of a year ago: at the main stretch from <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice to Lipno stands on our land near the state road advertising billboard black.
But three months was not enough for the officials to get rid of the unauthorized portable structures with a giant advertising poster.
It’s as if no one cares that they’re standing right next to the road, in a 50-metre protection zone where nothing can be done for safety.
Road managers say they can’t deal with the billboard simply because of the law.
Maybe load it up and take it away.
"We can't just afford that," says Road and Highways Director Nina Ledvinov<0xC3><0xA1>, referring to the complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must, according to the law, prevent.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began to be closely watched in the spring by the online newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, is not unique and points to a general problem that the state and authorities cannot solve effectively and quickly.
In southern Bohemia alone, the editorial office counted dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules just next to or near the road.
There are other regions as well.
"We have trouble forcing the company to remove the binders," confirms Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Kl<0xC3><0xA1>s, head of the transport department of the Czech Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice Regional Office, whose colleagues deal with similar stories.
According to the class, there is a law that binds officials.
First of all, it is difficult to reach out to the billboard owner to put the ad away.
But the bosses of companies are often unreachable or know the fiction that Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz has described in the past, when they began to be interested in the issue in more detail: it is enough to move a mobile stand with advertising by a few meters and officials can put the previous call to remove the black advertisement in the basket.
This is because the agency has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly do not agree, they look at it as a new device and we have to address the owner again," explains Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Kl<0xC3><0xA1>sa.
The new law will not help.
The change could be brought by a new law, which from September next year will ban billboards at highways and restrict them even on first-class roads.
Critics point out that the rules for cracking down on illegal and easily transferable ads will remain the same as ever.
And the authorities won't get away with it.
In this way, companies can continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns per year on the leases of illegal land, and no one can afford them.
For example, the billboard attracting Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know her well: the Czech Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice University currently runs three administrative procedures for black-built billboards.
The company faces a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000 in each case.
These are multiple ads that were placed without permission in the first-class road protection zone.
The controls have not yet been completed, says Jaroslav Mr<0xC3><0xA1>z, head of the transport department of the <0xC4><0x8C>eskobud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice Magistrate’s Office.
Advertising, which Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz is interested in, although it is not yet listed among these cases, but will soon most likely be added to them.
According to RSSD spokesperson Nina Ledvinov<0xC3><0xA1>, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will be put on the table by regional and then probably municipal officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of those suspicious companies that can’t be contacted.
It does not take over the post and has cancelled the official seat on <0xC5><0xBD>i<0xC5><0xBE>kov more than six years ago.
It is not even clear who is behind it.
In the past, the company’s mail went to South Bohemian entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who was famous for his fierce dispute with the head of the Czech representation of the Hyundai brand.
Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard rents and offers the areas from Comerz Billboard to advertisers, has refused any connection in the past.
At the same time, this spring, when <0xC5><0x98>SD began to be interested in advertising for Lipno, Fischer had state officials send a letter for the mysterious company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where the company is reportedly based.
To this day, however, no one has contacted the highway managers from this address.
It's a bad fight.
Similar silences or opaque changes in settlements are not uncommon.
A few years ago, we gradually fined one company two million crowns.
But she changed her name and ID and there was nothing to do.
The executor returned the case, the ads continued, perhaps in other places.
We are quite powerless against such companies and their business practices.
It's like fighting windmills, he admits, under the condition of anonymity, one of the officials.
No one has yet resolved the bill in this regard.
At the moment.cz has spoken to several MPs who have taken up the problem.
So far, they have not developed any activity.
On the contrary, MPs appeared who wanted to extend the term for the preservation of billboards in the main Czech communications.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrenic topic not only for national but also for regional and municipal politics.
On the one hand, they know about the social demand for their restriction, on the other hand, they need them for advertising in pre-election campaigns.
I’m not defending the fairly established notion that if something doesn’t work, you need to change the laws.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more rapeseed and poppy, according to statistics.
According to estimates by the Czech Statistical Office, the harvest of cereals this year will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Yet this year’s crop has exceeded the average in the last five or ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rapeseed (by 3.9 percent) and poppy (2.5 percent) will be higher.
This year’s cereal harvest will be 6.7 percent lower than last year.
Farmers will harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is based on an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office as of July 15.
The initial estimate a month ago was more pessimistic, predicting a ten-fold decline from last year.
Last year’s crop was above average.
This year’s harvest is above the average for the last five or ten years.
On the contrary, the harvest of rape and poppy this year will be higher.
Breeders will harvest 3.9 percent more than they did a year ago, when they received 1,256 million tons under the roof.
This year’s poppy crop could be 2.5 percent higher than last year’s.
The projected decline in cereal production is due both to a 3.7 per cent reduction in the yield per hectare to 5.71 tonnes per hectare and to a decrease in the area of the crop.
This year, farmers have reduced the number of fields by three percent.
Winter wheat, which is the most important cereal for the Czech Republic, is estimated to harvest 3.3 percent less this year.
The farmers moved it to more fields.
On the decline, however, a lower hectare yield will be signed, which will fall to 6.04 tons.
Roughly a fifth of the decline in statistics is predicted for spring barley, which is most often used for the production of beer.
The reduction of the crop area by 15.2 percent, but also a lower yield per hectare, is worth it.
Winter barley, on the other hand, is born 6.3 percent more.
The harvest of grain will also increase.
Rapeseed yields are estimated at 1.305 million tonnes, which is more than last year.
In fact, the crop area increased by 7.3 per cent.
However, the yield per hectare will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year’s rapeseed crop will exceed the ten-year average by 13.3 percent, while the crop is one-third larger than ten years ago.
In the last four years, poppy fields have also been growing.
This year, the farmers planted it on 35,543 hectares.
In 2008, when poppy was grown in the Czech Republic on a record 70,000 hectares, it is half the field.
Thanks to the expansion of crop areas, this year’s poppy harvest will be richer.
It will rise by 2.5 per cent to 27,423 tonnes last year.
However, the yield per hectare will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police accused two men of assault with a knife and machete, the court sent them to custody.
Police have charged two attackers who attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete in the centre of Olomouc on Tuesday.
"Although the attacker tried to escape, he was caused by urinary and cut wounds, which required treatment in the hospital and further treatment," said police spokesman Marie <0xC5><0xA0>trb<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Both suspects were arrested immediately after the attack by the police.
The plaintiff filed a motion for the court to detain them and the court acquitted him on Friday.
Both men face between three and ten years in prison.
Police have charged two detainees with assaulting a 35-year-old man in the centre of Olomouc with a knife and machete.
The attackers caused him urinary and cut wounds, the man ended up in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, which took place on Tuesday at right midday in the Freedom class, police said.
The perpetrators ended up in custody, Olomouc police spokesman Marie <0xC5><0xA0>trb<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
A mass clash between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of the center of Olomouc.
After an aggressive verbal argument, two attackers attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and machete.
Although the man was trying to escape, he suffered urinary and cut injuries that required hospital treatment and further treatment, a police spokesman said.
The fight, which attracted a lot of attention in the city center and due to which several police guards and officers had to intervene on the spot, was a family dispute.
Criminals charged a 43-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouc with attempted serious harm to health and riots.
The plaintiff filed a motion for the court to detain them and the court granted him on Friday, the spokesman added.
The machete was also used in the center of Olomouc during a mass battle five years ago, it happened only a few tens of meters away, in front of the Varna discotheque in Riegrov Street.
Police said at the time that a group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked the guests of the business who were standing in front of the entrance.
According to the police, they had knives, sticks and machetes in their hands.
The court then punished two attacking foreigners with a suspended sentence.
Abandoned and empty houses in the center of Prague.
You will be surprised, maybe you walk around them every day.
One of the most glaring examples of an unused and empty house is the large building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of Senov<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
It was supposed to be a hotel a long time ago.
But still nothing.
That it is necessary to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what to use the existing, often architecturally valuable and protected?
Right in the center of Prague, in the immediate vicinity of Wenceslas Square, there are a few practical houses, which, despite their location, size and often even the monument protection, are empty and empty.
We selected the properties in the center with the help of the project Pr<0xC3><0xA1>zdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term vacant properties in the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually the victims of financial problems of their owners, opaque relationships between companies or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty houses in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
Whether the owners pay a special tax for them, they want an initiative

Clinton’s husband made $10.6 million last year.
Trump has refused to release his tax returns.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars was given to Clinton for charity.
Most of Clinton’s income — more than $6 million — is behind their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax return.
U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton released her tax returns on Friday, putting pressure on her Republican rival Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, made $10.6 million last year, the AP reported.
Most of Clinton’s income — over $6 million — is behind their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton launched her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed that last year, Clinton’s spouses paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent, followed by a state and local income tax of 9 percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income in taxes.
But Trump has a problem with such a step, so far he has not decided to publish a tax return.
There’s a chance that Donald Trump won’t pay any taxes at all, Clinton wrote on Twitter a few minutes after publishing her confession.
Clinton is repeatedly returning to the secrets surrounding Trump’s income, among other things, to raise doubts about whether her opponent is indeed as rich as she claims.
Trump’s wealth is estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower income would damage the Republican candidate’s reputation as a successful entrepreneur.
Senator Tim Kaine, who is running for vice president in tandem with the former first lady, today released a report on his tax deductions over the past decade.
Together with his wife Anne Holton, they gave 7.5 percent of their earnings to charity and spent 25.6 percent on taxes last year.
In Nigeria, a giant once again broke through.
Islamists from Boko Haram have been preventing consistent vaccinations and killing doctors.
Cases of child molesters have resurfaced in Nigeria.
In the northeast of the country, the government has declared an emergency vaccination, as two children infected with the disease have been screened there.
Vaccinations were carried there by helicopters.
In the affected area were Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram, who prevented vaccinations and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was circulating undetected.
In the northeast of Nigeria, an emergency vaccination of children against measles will begin because two children infected with the disease have been screened there.
In Africa, mackerel was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Nigerian government has announced that one million children will be vaccinated in Borno state and another four million in surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday, according to the AP, quickly transported vaccines against children's measles to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said the virus had been circulating undetected in the area for many years.
In the past, Boko Haram extremists prevented vaccinations and even killed doctors.
Their attacks also made it impossible on Thursday for doctors to get to the area where children with measles were found.
Both affected toddlers came with refugees from parts of Nigeria newly liberated from Boko Haram.
WHO director Michel Zaffran, responsible for the eradication of measles, told the BBC that vaccination in Nigeria would begin next week.
The Islamic radical group Boko Haram has long been active in Borno.
The area was made available to international organizations and the government until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram in this part of the country managed to weaken in a fundamental way.
Nigeria’s health minister, Isaac Adewole, has admitted that new cases of measles are a big disappointment for the country, as Nigeria wanted to announce next year that it had eradicated measles.
The WHO has warned that it is possible that although the disease did not appear for two years, it still spread among children.
Vaccinated will now be children under the age of five.
In 2012, Nigeria accounted for half of all cases of measles in the world.
While in 1988 the giant was still in 125 countries, now it remains in only three areas - in Afghanistan and Pakistan and in northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the moving stories of fallen women.
Pope Francis met with twenty former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, escaped from a gang of pimps.
The Pope listened to their difficult life stories and urged them to look to the future with confidence.
At this meeting, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against it.
In Rome, Pope Francis met with twenty former prostitutes who had been freed by the police from the power of a gang of pimps.
The head of the Catholic Church listened for more than an hour to the moving stories of the fallen women and then urged them to look with confidence to the future, a Vatican spokesman said.
Among the former prostitutes Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
Their average age is around 30.
All of them, according to the Vatican, were subjected to cruel physical violence during forced prostitution.
Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for a stronger fight against it, the pope’s spokesman said.
Francis often draws attention to the destinies of people on the fringes of society.
On Thursday, for example, he had lunch with Syrian refugees who arrived at the Vatican this year in April and June thanks to his personal invitation.
France will attack the jihadists' factories.
Without the help of Muslims, this will not be possible.
In the fight against radical Islamism, the Muslims themselves have to help France.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is planning fundamental changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of clergy.
Since last December, we have closed 20 mosques and prayerben.
Others will follow, the interior minister said.
There are more than 100 jihadist factories in the country.
"If Muslims do not help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this freedom," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, it intends to ensure that only imams who were educated in France preach in mosques and prayer halls.
At the same time, he wants to stop financing mosques from abroad.
At the moment, about 20 percent of the money is coming from abroad to build new mosques, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Persian Gulf countries.
This is also why preachers come to the mosques, who can spread radicalism in France.
"Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy," he said.
The key to achieving these goals will be the new French Islamic Foundation.
It should serve as a bridge between the secular state and the Muslim minority.
No more money from abroad.
The French Foundation for Islam was founded in 2005 by the then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Already at that time, the foundation was supposed to contribute to the transparency of financial flows between mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institutions soon caught up with internal contradictions and rivalries.
"It's a total failure," Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, a debate broke out about a new institution that will replace the dysfunctional foundation.
Everything has accelerated the further terrorist attacks in France carried out on behalf of the Islamic State by radicalised Islamists.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve recently announced that a new foundation would be set up in October this year.
It will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise the imams.
For the time being, it is not clear where it will take money not only to build new mosques, but also various educational centers.
However, several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or food halal tax.
In practice, the sellers would pay to halal food, and this for providing certification.
Part of that money would then go to the foundation's cashier.
A contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French pilgrims who go to Mecca.
Every year there are about 30,000 of them on a traditional trip to Saudi Arabia.
And not only that.
According to the premiere, in the future, only preachers who have passed special educational programs at French universities should work in mosques.
This should ensure that the preaching work is in harmony with democracy.
Close the radical mosques.
The French government is at the same time campaigning against the radicals.
And others will follow, the interior minister recently announced.
In France, there is no place for those who proclaim hatred in mosques and do not respect some of the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are an estimated 2,500 mosques and prayer halls in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have expelled about 80 imams and in several other dozens they are considering it.
But not everyone thinks that the actions of the government can significantly intervene against radicalism.
Those who want to radicalize themselves will do the same.
This is not happening in mosques, young people are radicalizing on the Internet, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
Kelemen lost in the 1st round of the sprint with the star Baugé.
The Czech track cyclist has to fight for progress to the semi-finals in the correctional races.
The track cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after qualifying for the sprint among the top eighteen lost in the 1st round to the French giant Grégory Baugé, a defender of silver from the previous games in London.
He has to fight for his way to the semi-finals in the relegation races.
At the start of the royal discipline on the track stood 27 riders and the best Czech racer currently has a 14th best time.
He reached the two-hundred-and-a-half with a flying start in 9,969 seconds.
In the main elimination phase, he was expected to qualify for the fifth Baugé, who already has bronze from Ria in the team sprint.
Kelemen eventually reached out to an experienced Frenchman, but he kept an eye on the process.
Jason Kenny, the defender of the gold, shined with great performance.
Twenty-eight-year-old Britt took the third fastest doubles in history and won the qualification in the Olympic record of 9,551.
It was then, as expected, that he also dealt with the last follower, the German Maximilian Levy.
The British quartet was also successful with Bradley Wiggins, who took a new world record of 3:50,570 in the 4 km race and advanced to the final.
The previous maximum (3:51,659), which the British had been in for four years since the London Olympics, improved by more than a second.
Young doctors push: They want fresh wind in the industry
Representatives of young doctors met to approve new steps in their dispute over a new contract.
The Council of Young Physicians (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the whole council to support further field events from the beginning of September.
The JDC says the ministers have failed to resolve the issue of the treaty.
Young doctors and medical students voted in July to reject a contract agreed with the BMA.
58% of its members who took part in the election were rejected.
In a letter to members published Thursday night on Twitter, JDC President Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "still silent" on the issues leading to the rejection of the contract.
She said: "In this light, the JDC executive body by vote has decided to completely reject the proposed new treaty and request new formal negotiations on all issues."
In response to the government’s silence, the JDC Executive Board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council with a view to approving the ongoing programme of threatened industry events from early September.
The dispute led to the announcement of six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The leader of the young doctors at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract, which BMA recommended.
He told BMA members at pre-vote meetings in front of 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the deal was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the health minister said the contract would put a strain on doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: An alliance of "unconquerables"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the formal end of an eight-month-long verbal war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart to the luxurious palace hall in St. Petersburg, I had the impression that Ankara wants more of this reconciliation.
It was a handshake, yes.
But Putin did not smile and hardly radiated warmth from him, even according to his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, has repeatedly spoken about his "Dear Friend" to Mr Putin - five times, as one of the reports states.
I didn't count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to their pre-crisis level, but will be even better.
The next day, one of the local newspapers reported that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was the exact opposite.
But the lingering cold emanating from Putin has shown that the Russian leader has not forgotten anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: the downing of a Russian fighter jet by Turkey on the Syrian border.
Moscow’s reaction was fierce.
Putin dealt blows around him and accused Ankara of shooting Moscow in the back with a knife.
The offense was all the more that it came from an alleged friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps even impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since December.
For months, the state-controlled media led a massive all-out campaign against Ankara.
All of a sudden it looked like the Turks could do anything.
More serious were accusations from top state officials that Erdogan’s own family benefited from the illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg came the official message that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received the apology he had asked for from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared a victory as well.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
In the first place, Erdogan was almost deposed last month during a failed coup and therefore needs all his friends.
The repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have also visibly shaken him.
There is also an economic motive.
Russia’s sanctions have had a severe impact – especially the cancellation of charter flights, which annually carry several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast.
This number has been reduced by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly take a breather when flights are resumed.
They make money on the Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week, state television has promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when re-importation of agricultural commodities from Turkey will be allowed.
"Tourists there, tomatoes back here," as reported in the Vedemosta newspaper.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry at the West for what it sees as a poor response to the coup attempt.
In addition, the long-standing hostility of lengthy talks about joining the EU and the accession of Putin - who wants to be able to take advantage of the cold and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader certainly got bonus points when Ankara asked him for help from the elected bodies after the coup attempt.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deep-seated fear of regime change, it is given.
So the summit in this pompous, seaside palace of Russia and Turkey allowed me to demonstrate what one of the analysts described to me as an “alliance of incompatibles”: how the forces of two countries that feel rejected and exploited by the West unite.
However, despite the fact that they have publicly shown mutual reconciliation, there are fundamental differences between the two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently took on the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on opposite sides.
It could be said that after almost three hours of initial talks, the two presidents stated at a press conference that they had not even mentioned this issue.
The Turkish president deliberately answered the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on the basis of which the two countries could find common ground on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility – and given the risk of utter disaster when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet – it’s certainly better for both leaders to at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear for customers outside of Scotland
According to the executive director of the bank, the RBS brand is to be repressed into the role of back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be lost to customers outside of Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank’s global ambitions.
She was relieved when she almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be redeemed from debt.
At the time, strategists used “RBS” to protect other consumer finance brands.
She was behind millions of pounds spent sponsoring international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to champion Winbledom Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more prominence to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not launch new stores.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of central and stock exchange coding, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will get more in the forefront - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During the journey to customers and employees in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan’s questions.
He told BBC Scotland: “The RBS brand will cease to be our investor brand and the brand for which our employees work because we are now much more of a brand bank.”
As the bank itself became a global brand, it became a global brand as well as RBS.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the domestic scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, has prepared a profile of individual brands sponsoring the sport.
“It’s a good time for us to move to a brand bank, because the fundamental question (which we ask) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers,” he said.
Three years ago, it would have been very cynical to say that we are going to be a great bank for customers and introduce those brands.
But along with how we’ve focused on customer needs, not our own, I think there’s a lot of change going on.
We can recall these marks again, I think the right time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on horseback Predilection led to the goal of 3000th winner
Dettori sprays champagne after a double victory at Newmarket brought him 3,000 victories
Joke Frankie Dettori secured his 3000th victory in Newmarket on Friday.
He achieved this milestone with his second victory of the evening on his local track - the Predilection horse, which is coached by John Gosden.
Forty-five-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve such a result in straight races.
Its predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion Chekje Dettori, who previously won the Ghayyar horse, said: "It's strange."
I’m very excited because my family is here too.
I am extremely happy that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I anchored 30 years ago.
It's not a huge event, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I was relieved and I am very grateful.
Dettori gathers congratulations when he brings Predilection after victory
Two jockeys of this milestone have achieved in obstacle races - jockey champion Richard Johnson and 20-time retired champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who during his record-breaking career led to the goal of more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4,493 career winners
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of modern times and it is no surprise that he has reached a milestone that only a few riders have reached before him.
He is stylish and strong, but it is his tactical fistron that distinguishes him from other riders in the race.
He is a fantastic ambassador of racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom that if he hadn’t been riding only on weekends and big races, he would already have 6,000 winners!
However, the truth is that Frankie drove the winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that’s really something.
It has a lively character, which is good for British racing, but more importantly, it's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrates his success with his famous summer jump
From summer finishes to summer jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a beacon of British flat racing for two decades.
It was like driving on a mountain road.
An overwhelming number of big race winners, including his famous "great seventh" in Ascot, but he also survived a plane crash and was banned from starting because of drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a six-month ban on the start, but proved an incredible inner strength and came back in top form despite all the doubters.
And maybe not for the last time - Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue racing until at least 50 years.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has released the head of the presidential office Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin unexpectedly released Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office on Friday.
Ivanov was one of Putin’s closest collaborators for many years.
Thirty-six-year-old Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
The Kremlin said in a statement that Putin had "liberated Ivanov from his services as head of the Russian presidential office," but no reason was given.
He will be replaced by Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's deputy since 2012.
The forty-four-year-old War was previously a diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he was promoted to the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the embassy in Tokyo.
The website (in Russian) states that he later served as the head of the presidential protocol and presidential office.
When Putin was appointed, he said, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important role of the administration is to support your activities of the head of state in the sense of proposing laws and controlling the extent to which your instructions are complied with.
Putin told Russian television on Friday that Ivanov had asked him to be released from the post and had recommended that he be replaced by the military.
Convince the smiles?
This move completely mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin’s closest collaborators and, like Putin, he worked for the KGB.
As head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin broadcast on state television, the two men said they were leaving the post of head of the presidential office at their own request.
But the smiles in the cameras convinced only a few people - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is it the result of a struggle for power?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that the man, once thought of as a possible president, desires to suddenly lead Russia’s environmental policy has met with great distrust.
The Kremlin quoted Putin as saying: “It is true that in 2012, in an interview, I asked you to entrust me with this very demanding post, even a problematic post, for four years.
Apparently, I was the head of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commanded the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov one of his five closest associates.
At the time, there was even speculation that Ivanov might succeed Putin as head of state after his second term, because the third term would be unconstitutional for Putin.
This post, however, was taken over by another close associate of Putin Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister just three-and-a-half years later before returning to office.
Thomas Gibson, star of The Thoughts of a Criminal, was released after he hit the director.
Gibson got involved in a physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
ABC and CBS, which produce the series, announced its release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before announcing his dismissal.
There were creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I'm sorry that this happened," he said in a statement.
According to ABC and CBS, details of how Gibson's character will disappear from the series, which follows the stories of a team of FBI agents, are a little later.
The 45-year-old actor, who was famous for starring in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, appeared in the series from the first series in 2005.
“I love the Thoughts of a Criminal and have been putting my heart and soul into them for the past 12 years,” Gibson said in a statement.
I was hoping to be in it until the end, but now it's not possible.
I would also like to express my gratitude to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and above all to the great fans that this show could have hoped for.
The series is expected to return to series 12 on September 28.
In the town of Banff mysteriously landed in the garden of fish
A man from the town of Banff asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish may be sand eels that have been left there by the watermelon.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, posted a short film of his findings on the Periscope channel, thinking that someone could help him clarify how about 5 centimeters of fish got into his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connecting with Fife
<0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project to be completed by May 2017
The engineers connected the north platform and Queensferry Crossing and the viaduct - the bridge now connects to Fife.
It is therefore the first of four closures between the "windows of platforms", which are now almost completed around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hanging ropes.
The <0xC2><0xA3>1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment for the construction of Queensferry Crossing.
In this project, we are all witnessing how construction engineers have used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to construct this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge platform was a delicate operation that required extraordinary precision.
In its place is now a total of more than 79% of the total area of the bridge, concrete for the last part of the platform is now poured in Rosyth, so the whole platform is ready to be raised to the bridge.
Michael Martin, Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project manager, said: “The first closure of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the pinnacle of earthworks.
After installing the last part of the road platform and its connection to the expanding North Tower platform, we had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by extending the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be towed with a climb of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerances with which the team worked were very small - only a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men 'happy to be alive'
Three men are "happy to be alive" after being washed off their fishing boat off Anglesey.
The Moelfre rescue boat station RNLI issued an alert on Friday at 13:20 UK daylight saving time after the crew saw the incident in Moelfre Bay.
All three men tried to swim to safety as their boat continued unguidedly.
"We saw their boat circling close to them and we thought the worst of it," said rescue boat helmsman Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong wind drove him away from them before we left," he added.
Two men rescued by a local fishing boat, a third man at the age of 60 was found without a lifejacket exhausted as he held up the fighters.
All were transferred on board the coastal lifeboat and transported back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said: “Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely uninjured.
The ship's engine had an emergency shut-off line, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when the boat flipped over.
Someone above those boys was holding a protective hand.
The judge refuses to hear the case because of Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>e's wife.
Petr Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> is one of three MPs who, according to the indictment, should have received political traffic from Prime Minister Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as and his then-chief of the cabinet Jana Nagyov<0xC3><0xA1>, i.e. a lucrative post for a political concession.
In 2012, it was the approval of the tax package.
Schneidr, Fuksa and Tlucho<0xC5><0x99> made it possible with their resignations.
Then they appeared on influential posts in state-owned companies.
That is why they also faced suspicion of bribery and ended up in jail for a month.
According to the court, however, unauthorized, and thus almost 2 million crowns were compensated.
The prosecutor now acts as a witness in the case, after the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a courthouse on the Fruit Market and settles civil disputes.
Nevertheless, the judge Helena Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lov<0xC3><0xA1> wants to be careful (she deals with criminal matters - ed.) and avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to be handled by another Prague court district.
The King has already acquitted Jana Ne<0xC4><0x8D>asov<0xC3><0xA1>, formerly Nagy, twice.
It was an alleged misuse of military intelligence to track Prime Minister Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as Radka's first wife.
In this case, the interpreter did not figure.
But according to lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessary overreaction.
I think that impartiality cannot be interpreted as excluding the court if the witnesses have a wife or relatives in court.
I'm afraid nothing could be judged at all, he noted for the newspaper.
"I think it's ugly," he added.
In the case of political traffic, Roman Bo<0xC4><0x8D>ek, a former official, is also accused.
According to his lawyer, Peter Toman, however, any objection would have a chance of success.
On 13 June, the District Court for Prague 1 heard the indictment of former Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as Jana Nagy (now Ne<0xC4><0x8D>asov<0xC3><0xA1>) and others accused of abusing the Military Intelligence.
In the picture, she comes to court with her husband.
The plumber was supposed to handle the statements about Peroutka.
For example, the exhibitor’s wife was supposed to judge President Milos Zeman’s statements about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutka.
Zeman said he was sympathetic to Adolf Hitler.
One of the schoolgirls is already dead!
The girl apparently died in an air raid by Allied forces.
She flew to Syria with her two equally old friends from London’s Gatwick Airport in February last year.
The British Ministry of the Interior did not comment on the report of her death.
According to police, the young Londoners, who fled their homes, were secretly transported to Syria via the Turkish border.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, and Kadiza Sultana have reportedly headed for their next former classmate at London’s Bethnal Green Academy.
The case last year sparked a huge wave of attention and also tension in relations between Britain and Turkey.
British security officials estimate that some 600 British Muslims have travelled to Syria so far, including some 50 young women and girls.
A number of them joined the radicals from ISIS and other groups.
Those who return home pose a terrorist threat to Britain.
A dream job for a hundred grand.
Great job, which you don’t even need college for.
That's what it looks like at first glance.
And often the other.
The advantage is not only an extremely high salary for Czech ratios (in Prague you will earn up to 180 000 CZK by working in IT), but also extreme advantages.
The reason is a huge shortage of IT specialists.
Thousands of specialists are missing.
According to estimates, almost 20,000 IT specialists are missing in the Czech Republic.
According to the statistics of the staff agency Grafton, among the most searched are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
Candidates can choose from several job offers.
Thus, candidates are not competing for a job position, but job positions for candidates, comments Jitka Sou<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, marketing manager at Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
However, higher education is not a necessity for students.
Higher education is a good foundation and is an overall indicator of a candidate’s intelligence and educational ability, but often has little in common with development knowledge.
Developers have to constantly learn new things, which will not replace a university, says Petr Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka, director of Monster Career CZ.
The most money will be made in Prague.
The wages of the Athenians are everywhere high above the average of the republic.
The most money will come in Prague and Brno, in the regions it is no longer such a hitparadise.
"The wage conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague," Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka confirms.
The technical directors will achieve the highest earnings.
In Prague and Brno they can come to 120 000 - 180 000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it will not fall below 80,000 CZK.
IT project managers are also in demand.
On arrival they can earn 60,000 - 100,000 CZK.
It's also about graduates.
While in some professions, graduates often have to go straight to the office of work, this is not the case for janitors.
If companies drag on and overpay an expert from another company, they will be happy to reach out to the graduate.
They can raise him in their own way.
They can't do without language.
Knowledge of a foreign language is suitable in every profession, but a minimum of decent English is necessary for the Ajt<0xC3><0xA1>k people.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a must for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we are faced with a number of cases where companies are especially looking for a professionally educated and experienced person and are satisfied only with the average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker controls more foreign languages, he is interesting for his employer, because he can serve more customers from different countries, adds the director of Kuba<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
Yoo in Google, there's paradise.
Only quietly can Czech workers envy the employees of Google.
Of course, for them, flexible working hours, the possibility of working from home or various shortened periods, not only for mothers.
“The company provides newly-baked dads with an extra four weeks of vacation after the baby is born,” says Martina Jonekova, a Google spokesperson.
H<0xC3><0xBD><0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC3><0xAD> also includes health care for employees and family, nutrition, transport, training, wellness or massage directly at the workplace.
If you want to learn, you have green and it doesn’t matter what you want to learn.
But the benefits don’t end there.
Such a full fridge for free is also definitely not to be thrown away.
A healthy lunch (in some locations as well as breakfast and dinner) is available on site every day.
In addition, there are so-called microkitchens in all offices, where people will always find a healthy snack, the spokesman said.
And so that nothing has to be thrown away, so that it is not carried, it will put in boxes that employees can take home in the evening.
And the reason for these incredible advantages on Czech conditions?
Create a creative and motivating environment!
“For Google, it’s not important that employees sit in the office for eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions,” he added.
The U.N. strongly criticized Bulgaria for criminalizing refugees.
Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein, the UN human rights commissioner, accused Bulgaria on Thursday of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government “is of serious concern that Bulgaria is not complying with international law,” Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
“It is particularly disturbing to see how important and influential public figures are publicly expressing support for the criminal armed fighters who are reluctant to organize the hunt for refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey,” he said.
"One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who cross into Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested," Zeid said.
And what's worse - they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or longer - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that everyone has the right under international law to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants this year, compared with 21,000 in the same period last year.
Pokémon Go - the pursuit of health and happiness that pays off
It’s fascinating to watch the world change.
A number of people over the past decade have lamented that teenagers and children no longer play outside and prefer to spend their free time in front of screens.
Pokémon Go picks people up from interviews and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens originally froze on television, later on video games and most recently on smartphones.
It’s great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
Of course, I’m talking about the mode that is Pokémon Go, an app based on characters that first appeared in video games in the late 90’s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest before the launch of this new game in early July in the US, Australia and New Zealand.
Listings in other countries were then delayed due to a strong interest that led to server overloads.
Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter has in just a few days.
How does it work?
In short, players on a smartphone go out looking for Pokémon that track using GPS, and when they find them, they can "take a picture" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "catch".
Mania has captured a generation playing the game at a young age, picking it up from its seats and taking it out to look for Pokémon.
In the US, thanks to this game, there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that the “average” person will take every day.
Apple’s Cardiogram app for smartwatches, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game’s launch, the number of people who exercised every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company has no information on who is playing Pokémon Go - it only sees rough data on exercise levels.
Many public campaigns aimed at getting people to “find 30,” “get off the couch,” and “be active every day” fell on barren ground because most public health messages are boring and targeted at people who don’t look good.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their risk of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity is involved in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we can’t fully list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover the three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunlight. And fun.
Some people even make new friends in their pursuit of Pokémon.
As is the case, there are, of course, those boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can enter the door.
And what, like?
There's been a breakthrough.
At the time, smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity, but they didn’t give us a reason to do something like this game.
The novelty is being tamed and the interest in it begins to decline at some point.
However, thanks to the success of Pokémon, other games will appear that will combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity and help many people in the pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles wins gold in women’s multi-fight gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to all of this.
Dynamic at the jump.
Don't bet too hard.
In simple terms, they all went mad.
Excellent in everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast went straight for the title in a multi-fight on Thursday and overtook the others in full line under the Olympic spotlight.
The overall score of 62,198 clearly confirmed her lead over silver medalist and member of the "Final Five" team Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during a betting performance in the final of the multi-fight individual in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American in a row to win a multi-fight, and the fifth overall, when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and perhaps the best ever.
When her overall final score was on the board and her long journey to this point ended, tears appeared on her face.
This success ranks her in the same league of unique athletes of her time as Michael Phelps, who have added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 medals at the world championships – including 10 golds. Her stunning ensembles are a mixture of ambition and precision, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her “the best gymnast she’s ever seen.”
The last test was waiting for her in Brazil, not so much between Biles and the rest of the racers, but between herself and the burden of too high expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with his hands full of gold medals would be perceived as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman hug each other after winning a gold and silver medal in the women's multi-fight singles final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
The first Biles received on Tuesday, when she was a cheerleader in the outgoing national team coordinator Martha Karolyov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Biles insists that she has never looked forward during her long journey to the summit, but this is not entirely true.
Part of her composition in the freestyle - the one that contains for her a typical triple jump with a double turn - is set in Latin music, which would just fit at home, in the streets outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler and her talent was discovered by the mother of coach Aimee Boorman on her way to the gym, where Boorman trained and where he gained strength.
The multi-fight competition has not lost since the summer of 2013 - it's a trail of victory that can continue as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafin took the lead for a short time thanks to the two turns, it was just an illusion.
The pros and cons - where Biles defends the world championship - are waiting.
She got back in the lead with 15,433 points per bet - and finished with 15,933 points in free throws.
Raisman hugged her softly as they waited for the final score—a mere formality—and around the bright red, white, and blue shadows, Biles' tears appeared when she fulfilled a wish she had once written in her diary as a child.
Raisman's performance was a bit of a reward for the Olympics four years ago, when she shared a third place with Mustafin, but then she got bronze due to the sum of the three best teams.
This time the twenty-two-year-old captain of the team, whom the Americans call “grandmother,” was way ahead.
In her spare time, she sent a crowd of air kisses, overcome by a return that sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post that this 19-year-old athlete posted this week on Twitter, where she became a complete hit, has a whole new meaning:
Police: Three victims in the case of a serial killer shot while listening to music in the car
According to a police report released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl died during the most serious attack in decades, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix. They were shot while sitting in the car, talking and listening to music.
Authorities said Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 in a car parked on the driveway.
The report states that the gunman was standing on the side of the passenger and fired eight shots from the handgun, then fled in another vehicle.
According to the police, he is not behind the triple murder robbery, because the attacker did not take the wallet, nor the amount of $ 2,900, which one of the adult victims had with her.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sgt. Jonathan Howard, said investigators were investigating whether the shooting had any connection to any of the previous four attacks.
In two predominantly Hispanic neighborhoods, a total of nine attacks took place over the course of four months, in which seven people were killed and two others were injured.
"It's happening in the villa neighborhood in front of the houses," Howard said earlier this month for CBS's KPHO branch.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to reveal what evidence led them to conclude that the attacks were related to each other and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to a hospital, where she later succumbed to her injuries.
Liner (31) and Ellis' daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told police it was not unusual for women to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities have also released a police report of the shooting, which was targeted by an empty delivery just half an hour before the triple murder. The police believe that this serial killer was responsible.
Investigators found the shells and assembled a bullet from the remains of the bullets in the seat and from under the bonnet of the engine.
Mother of six-year-old child with microcephaly: “His condition is improving”
Edmund Picciuto, like most children his age, loves singing, toys, and of course, his mother.
But unlike his peers, he suffers from microcephaly, which is a consequence of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know about during pregnancy.
When he first came home, I thought I couldn't handle it.
I can't do this.
I'm not ready for this.
Which is not true at all - of course you are ready for it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund may never know them and that he may not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in the institute.
"My first reaction was that I thought people weren't doing this anymore today," Picciut said.
Edmund walks with the help of a walker.
Until he was three years old, he couldn't sit or crawl, and he still can't talk.
Some of the limits are already slowly being met.
He walks with help and rides a bike.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth gives a sign-speech, with which Edmund says, "Please sing to me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciut told CBS News.
But it is not a common sign language - it says that Edmund invented some of the signs himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, such as in the case of Edmund, and after infections in pregnancy caused by viruses such as measles or Zika.

Heavy rains and flooding have prompted rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi.
Heavy rains and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected in the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service (NWS) has announced that after extreme flooding, a number of rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi will drain from their shores and are threatened by widespread flooding.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and assistance was already on its way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the governor’s office for national security and emergency preparedness, said they were receiving requests for vehicles to drive in water, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that only the district of Tangipahoa asked for ten thousand bags of sand.
Flood patrols will remain in most of South Louisiana to work through Saturday.
The meteorological service said in a statement that it could rain another 8 to 13 centimetres above sea level.
In southern Alabama, a flood watch was on standby on Friday as rain continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite Rivers at Baton Rouge and the Amite River at Denham Springs are forecast to culminate this weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said the two said they could flood a number of homes in suburban areas of Baton Rouge.
He further stated that the danger is flooding after the current in the district of Ascension, when these dilute streams will flow into Lake Maurepas only slowly.
The Tickfaw River, slightly south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached local time at its highest recorded level as early as 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers are still picking up people from the floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and step-son were among those rescued at Gloster earlier on Friday.
Hansford, 62, said the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said that he had been warned by his other step-son, who lives nearby.
"We woke up and the water was coming," Hansford said.
We had it all the way to the waist.
According to his wife, this is the highest level she has ever experienced on the river in the last 48 years.
Hansford said he and all members of his family are disabled and he is the only one who can swim.
Hansford said crisis workers rescued all three huge military-style trucks and transported them to a fire station in Gloster, where they remained hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that as heavy rains continue, flooding is “rapidly spreading” and authorities are considering evacuation.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livinston reported that from midnight to Friday morning, 35 centimeters of rain fell.
Krautmann said the soil has been heavily soaked since Wednesday.
The authorities said heavy rains and paid trips required the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa district and the cancellation of classes in five school districts.
CBS’s WWL branch said 200 homes had been flooded, according to an elderly man from Tangipahoa.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven domestic animals that had been trapped by high water.
Shelters were set up in the village of Amite and in the town of Hammond for those who had been evacuated.
"They'll be able to come home when the water starts to fall," he said.
More than 20 streets were closed due to flooding in the Tangipahoa district of Hammond, and local residents were given sandbags to pick up and try to protect their homes and businesses from the water.
"We had the last major flooding here in March," Lacy Landrum, the city's administrator, said.
These floods seem to be similar.
Rupert Lacy, crisis manager for Harrison County, Mississippi, said persistent rains were continuing on the Persian Gulf coast.
He said several homes were reported flooded on Thursday, but none of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, Head of Shopper Value Foods at Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in a few places where I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still there."
Mahaj Brown (6) - "a boy shot like a gunman", survived shooting in Philadelphia
According to police, a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, the second shooting this week of a 6-year-old boy in the city.
His parents identified him as Mahaje Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandparents say the boy suffered several gunshot wounds, including weakness, legs, arms, and abdomen, but was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He took a lot of power, his little body was shot as it was being handled," his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition at the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family for the station said the boy should be cured.
He was supposed to be in the first grade of elementary school.
Mahaj Brown is among four people who were shot in the Germantown area.
Three other men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, two more victims are in a stabilized condition.
According to the station, the child was found shot in the front seat of the vehicle along with a twenty-nine-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could have been a shooter.
Investigators at the CBS Philadelphia station said there was likely a gunfire between several armed men.
On the spot were found shells of assault weapons, belonging to various assault weapons.
I think it was definitely a continuing battle.
There were bullets on both sides of the street.
So it seems that there were a few armed combatants who were actively involved," Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several homes and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been arrested and police are reportedly investigating the video footage from the cameras.
Another six-year-old, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a stray gun on Tuesday outside a house in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
The girl is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I picture a women’s gymnast team for this year’s Olympic Games, for a number of reasons.
First, I’ve been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And secondly: There are three gymnasts on this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, who have inspired so many young colored girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and the Catholic Madison Kocian.
We finally have a team that looks like America.
He also cemented the presence of blacks and Latin Americans at the top of the sport.
The number one gymnast in the past four years was an African-American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second sides last year.
That means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became the Olympic champion and America rejoiced.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of three-time world champions Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who performed unexpected but masterful gymnastics figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American to win gold in a women’s singles multi-fight.
And team member Aly Raisman got the silver.
We're witnessing the sport's peak, but in gymnastics classes in the country, it doesn't look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie made the same trip to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the “final five” because the gymnast team at the next Olympic Games will consist of only four athletes, and this is the last year that Marta Karolyi is training.
The fact is, however, that gymnastics is a financially demanding sport and gymnasts train mainly in private gymnastics clubs that maintain parents who pay the cost of training, equipment, travel, jerseys, competition fees, hotel accommodation (not for coaches and their trustees and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich suburban areas that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnasts have all the training and for families of gymnasts and gymnasts it is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles's coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez's coach, both trained athletes when they started gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics workouts that are more accessible and accessible to the communities of countless young girls who have inspired Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem to more than 15,000 young people within the city (especially of black and Hispanic origin) and we have trained national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team that will send to us thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics. And that is great.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It's a very exciting time.
Thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for demonstrating the “virgin power” and winning Olympic team gold. And thank you for motivating so many young girls of all backgrounds to set out on a journey to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejection of Jeremy Hunt’s proposal, young doctors are ready to enter further strikes
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract with the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be an end to disagreements over the changes. But 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the election rejected the contract.
Hunt in July revealed plans to enforce the contract with the NHS being in “no man’s land” and further delays would have a detrimental impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract, which includes changes in night and weekend work procedures with the aim of improving care in non-social hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA Young Physicians Commission, said in a statement last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, especially in the sense that there will be an increase in the current crisis of the workforce and therefore a fair treatment of all doctors.”
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors goes under a new contract, it is necessary to make progress and time is running out.
BMA’s efforts to resolve disputes through negotiations have met with reluctance to involve the doctor and often with deafening silence on the part of the government.
And that’s despite Jeremy Hunt’s promise last month that this option is still open.
"Jeremy Hunt must now act, push for coercion, and address the concerns of young doctors."
If this does not happen, then the young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike in late April, nearly 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 visits were postponed as nurses and specialists were called to represent doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract, disagreements on the changes would be reached with representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA).
The BMA wants higher pay for weekend work for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of a contract.
Daniel Mortimer, chairman of the NHS employers, urged young doctors not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: “The industry action will achieve little or nothing, but there will be pressure on already overburdened teams and services and there will be increased concerns, exhaustion and disruption for patients, caregivers and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have been working with the Council of Young Physicians and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of the supervisor and informant.
Employers hoped that continuing positive involvement in other important issues - such as workload, flexibility in training, further training for those returning after career interruption, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study leave and pay gap between the sexes - was evidence of this.
The drug for sixty crowns a day can reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of a heart attack will be able to take the drug, which in turn costs about sixty crowns (two pounds). Authorities recommend giving it to more patients for a longer period of time.
The anti-coagulation drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of a heart attack in people with heart disease.
The medicine is now given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of a stroke or other seizure.
The NHS watchdog NICE recommends that the drug be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be given to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer another attack or heart attack.
Infarction and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which on the walls of the arteries creates a coherent layer.
If this layer is severed, a blood clot may occur, a blockage of blood access to the heart, and a heart attack may occur.
If the clot loosens, the blood clot may continue to block the blood supply to the brain and cause a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at a higher risk of having another attack.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk by causing clots less likely to occur.
The NICE draft directive, which was published today, recommends that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventative treatment, there are a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will suffer another heart attack or stroke – often with devastating consequences.”
The fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
We are pleased that with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor we can expand the treatment options available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - in particular the risk of bleeding - is limited to more than three years, treatment beyond this time is not recommended in the proposed treatment.
With computer culture, frauds began to flourish in Muslim areas
The mayor of Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was removed from office last year because of corruption, which was linked to a government report.
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread fraud in Muslim communities being overlooked, according to a government report.
Former Minister Sir Eric Pickles sharply criticizes the police, election inspectors and city councillors for ignoring voter abuse because of “hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
The former secretary of the community, now the ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said that intimidation of voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should make cordons in front of the polling stations and protect the alerted voters.
He recommended that voters take with them proof of identity and be able to prove who they are in the elections.
At present, voters only need to indicate their name and address.
The report further proposes to apply an indelible ink to the fingers of the people when casting the vote, in order to avoid that someone will vote twice.
Whistleblowers should have more protection, Pickles says.
It calls for greater access by the press to documents from meetings and to decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
“This is not just about protecting against electoral fraud, but also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
Downing Street had requested the report as a result of an election scandal in Tower Hamlets, West London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the city’s acting mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from his post on charges of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had “cynicized” the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, in his words, “led his campaign in such a way that it was the religious duty of devout Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were cast or as a result of identity theft, when a person votes and surrenders to someone else.
Sir Eric stated that there is evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern about fraud in correspondence voting – which is claimed to have been the practice of older members of the Muslim community pressuring people to vote for the candidates they elected.
Sir Eric, in the picture, gave some recommendations on how to clean up the electoral system, including presenting proof of identity
The report states: “Evidence has been provided that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been pressured to vote according to the will of the elders, especially in communities originating in Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
“There have been concerns that ... state institutions have turned a blind eye to such behavior because of ‘politically correct’ hypersensitivity to ethnic origin and religion.”
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including prohibiting political activists from tampering with correspondence voices and preventing “voice extraction.”
The report, which is now being evaluated by Theresa May, also calls for more thorough checks on registrations to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and bribery.
Consider asking voters to provide proof of identity before the vote.
The use of indelible ink on the fingers of people when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Carry out systematic checks on the nationality of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Requests for automatic correspondence voting shall be limited to three years.
Prohibit political agitators and activists from tampering with submitted mail ballots and election envelopes.
Give the police the authority to create cordons around the polling stations.
To amend the laws to make it easier to prosecute persons developing illegal coercion under the 1983 Reform Act.
Prohibit the taking of photographs in polling stations.
To require that only Englishmen (except Wales) work in the polling stations.
Strengthen training and ensure that workers adhere to the rule that voters go to the polling booths individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it is "surprising" that no criminal charges were brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The Election Court has ruled out Lutfur Rahman and his agent for litany of corruption and illegal practices," he said.
For a number of reasons, he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubt - in the strength of evidence of a crime.
He also criticizes the ineffective "checking of check boxes" in the departments for registration of voters in the town hall.
Sir Eric said: “Last year’s court decision in the Tower Hamlets case by Awakening.
Our nation has a proud reference to the cradle of parliamentary democracy, but the disturbing and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some institutions threaten this reputation.
Insanity of the bicyclist duchess Kate and other doubles celebrities at the Olympics in Rio
Fans of the Olympic Games in Rio 2016 went crazy this week with French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is remarkably similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the twenty-four-year-old Olympian is by no means the only athlete seeking gold this year who can boast of her own double among celebrities - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Rio Olympics and all the celebrities that are currently appearing on our screens, the FEMAIL Women's Column has compiled a list of Olympians who are more than remotely similar to Hollywood celebrities.
A member of the American archer team Brady Ellison (left) has been compared to Leonard DiCaprio since childhood.
In addition to Kate’s cycling double, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain archer could be the twin of star Leonard DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a racer from the U.S. archers’ team, has caused a storm on Twitter after his images emerged, in which he is strikingly similar to a wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media frenzy and admitted that he had been hearing about his resemblance to Lee from a young age.
"He himself doesn't see much of a resemblance, except maybe the beards," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's cool and looks good, so I think it's a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly be emphasized even more this year: the striking resemblance between the British long-distance jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafinov<0xC3><0xA1>, with her large, expressive eyes, was said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the series Gell Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for a change: The user thinks that Nathan with the "athletic version" of the actor from the movie "Inception"
Another long-standing comparison is the comparison of tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who have similarly dense eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimova is not only proud of the same brown skin and blonde hair Annalynne McCord has. And about Nathan Adrian from the US team, fans say that she looks like an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Talented women: football star Hope Solov<0xC3><0xA1> (left) and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar face and eyes shape
Not only one: the Twitter user was very pleased that others noticed the similarities
On the waves of theory: According to this user, there may be a reason for a similar appearance of couples
One Twitter user recently posted on the site expressing her satisfaction that “the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solov<0xC3><0xA1> and Jennifer Carpenter are in fact identical.”
Football star Hope Solov<0xC3><0xA1> and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have an incredibly similar face and eye shape.
Among other popular comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or the gold medal holder for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of his wonderfully wide smile, which seems to copy Gabriel’s film Brav<0xC3><0xAD>l’s mouth!
CBC Olympic Games commentator apologizes for saying that the Chinese swimmer has "blowed out"
Viewers of Wednesday's live broadcast of the Olympic Games at the CBC station outraged the analysis of the performance of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan by commentator Byron MacDonald. The swimmer finished in fourth place of the women's race on 4x200 m freestyle relay
Canadian station CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said the 14-year-old Chinese swimmer “stripped like a stink” and “blowed out” during the race.
Commentator Byron MacDonald thought that his microphone was turned off when, at the end of the women's 4x200 metre freestyle relay final, he began to whisper his own opinions.
MacDonald, who was supposed to bring “revival” to the CBC team of commentators, said, among other things, “That little 14-year-old from China gave it up, you idiot.”
Too much excitement, stretched like a stench, blew up.
Oh, thank you.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swam the second relay of the race in 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Ruck and allowed the Canadians to reach China.
Viewers in Canada began to quickly speak up online and were horrified by the tone and language the commentator used.
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: "Did the voter on CBC say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China 'bounced'???"
The idiot didn't notice he was still on the air."
Ai Yanhan of China in the final of the women's relay race at 4x200 meters freestyle was described as: "That little 14-year-old from China gave up, you fool."
Byron MacDonald’s criticism on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his appeal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald was, they didn’t hold back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada, and it sounds like we're a bunch of racists.
Shortly thereafter, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live commentary and said, "We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimmer who escaped into the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we're sorry it happened."
CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to the comment
Scott Russel apologized on behalf of MacDonald
CBC then copied and pasted their apology in response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about comments by MacDonald’s commenter.
The station also quickly apologized and issued a statement.
She sincerely regrets that the words were uttered, she should not have entered the ether.
We quickly apologized to our viewers in the broadcast and to those who follow us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments concerned the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer herself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words. Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to explain his remark by claiming that he did not want it to sound like a personal attack.
"I'd like to apologize now for the comment I made last night after the women's relay," he said in a broadcast from the Olympics on CBC.
"I meant the performance of the swimmer, not the person of the swimmer as such."
“There’s no need to say that I didn’t mean any disrespect, and I’m very sorry.”
Primark customers offended by a woman who unashamedly tried underwear in the middle of a store
When the woman undressed to try on her panties on the sales floor in the middle of Primark, the shoppers weren’t sure which way to look.
To make matters worse, she tried to fit her size, undressed her panties and put them back on the shelf.
She continued to browse, eventually trying out four pairs of panties at the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Flokestone.
Primark store in the Bouverie Place shopping mall in Folkestone, where a woman tried on her panties before returning them to the shelf
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the store at the time, said the mysterious woman “dressed up again and left the store without buying anything.”
She said, "People couldn't believe their eyes."
She stood in the middle of the store, took her panties off the shelf, undressed her own pantyhose and panties, and put them on.
"She didn't even try to find a discreet place - she just stood there, bold as a monkey."
"Everyone was just staring at her pants again, and obviously she didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf."
She did the same with three others before finally deciding that she didn't like anything, dressed up again and left.
"She didn't seem to care who was looking at her at all - nor did she think of the man who might be buying the pants she tried."
Miss Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said: “The idea that someone would take home the panties that someone else was wearing and no one had cleaned them up. That’s disgusting.”
The event took place on Tuesday afternoon.
Miss Davidson added: “When she left, I collected things that she obviously tried to pull from the sale – which is also the only right thing to do.”
"I'd be scared to think I'd bring home a new pair of panties and find that another woman was wearing them, undressed them, and they weren't washed."
A Primark spokesperson said: “Primark is aware of an incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.”
All the products concerned were withdrawn from sale.
How to defend against a gun attack using Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com it could be a little safer for you.
We spoke to Rhon Mizrachi, the grandmaster of the Krav Maga Federation based in New York City, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain dominance over a rapist, whether he approaches you from the front or from the back.
If they approach you from behind, Mizrachi says, then the first thing you need to do is turn around to see your attacker and “have a clear shot path.”
Then grab the weapon between your forearm and shoulder just before you hit it in the face with a free arm.
Then he follows the knee into the thighs, and while the attacker is writhing in pain, you twist the gun out of his hand, hit the main one in the face and begin to retreat, while holding the gun aimed at him.
If you are approached by an armed man from the front, it is a similar technique - get your body out of the firing line, grab the gun and twist it so that the villain can not shoot.
At the same time, give the weapon strength and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the weapon from its grip and begin to retreat, still aiming at him.
Does it sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way to get out of a robbery - if you're not the grand master of Krav Maga - is to spend all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright licks the dirtiest places in Europe into a travel guide
The British traveler decided to undergo a severe test of his immune system and lax reflex - licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Suffolk-born host and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, licked a euro banknote, railings at Piccadilly Circus, flushed a toilet on a train, and a Russian public telephone with his tongue to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and all of us what he was getting into.
The experiment that led to the film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, however, produced interesting results.
The idea of licking the button of the flusher on the train, which has been used by thousands of other people, may seem completely repulsive, however, for example, in the kitchen sink is actually much more harmful bacteria.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Ian Wright talked to doctors and health specialists about strengthening the bacteria of the intestinal flora and about his own health.
Fortunately, none of what he licked left anything worse in his mouth than the smell.
Ian Wright became famous for testing the resistance of his intestines on trips around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission, he safely tested his immune system – from public railings at train stations to a flushing toilet.
In the film, he says: “I haven’t cared much about my health since I was a child, and I’ve put everything in my mouth, from dirt to eating worms and muddy water.”
In the film, he confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused was the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple swipe, the luminometer showed the value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, freshly washed hands should have less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia has refused to lick after its luminometer showed more than 4,000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60.
Ian Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio filmed a traveler’s film called The Lickhiker’s Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom.
In the film, he said, “This is almost the ugliest thing I’ve ever felt in the toilet.”
There's nothing dirtier than this!
I'm not licking anything because it's disgusting.
The film Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was shot in collaboration with Finnish dairy producer Valio.
Mr. Wright was given Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help strengthen gut bacteria and the immune system in humans.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s senior vice president for snacks, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that they would watch with enthusiasm and at the same time allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We came up with a lot of crazy ideas that ended up with the idea of "let's call Ian."
It is said that interest in the health of the intestines becomes a worldwide phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in broader contexts – good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in a healthy gut is a worldwide phenomenon and through this document we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think that there is a great sense of humor in the film!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s put it this way, Ian would have lost my respect if he licked some of what I wanted him to do – like the disgusting Russian toilet that pops up in the movie.”
To paint some things was naturally easier for Ian, while others were quite difficult.
I’m glad we filmed some of the licking of those dirty things.”
Valio conducted a survey in 2015 that found that 84 percent of respondents associated lactic acid bacteria primarily with their stomach and gut health, and 58 percent of respondents reported that they at least occasionally use products containing added lactic acid bacteria.
A family in need of social assistance has destroyed a community building in the town of Saltash, Cornwall.
The family of the socially needy left <0xC2><0xA3>50,000 worth of damage to their townhouse after being accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were evicted from a house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long string of complaints against them.
After their violent emigration from the house, the officials of the housing cooperative were shocked when they found out that the property was in a state of emergency.
There were holes in the walls, the floor covering was torn, garbage was poured all over the floor, and the walls were plastered.
The family has already moved out and is considered to be living in private accommodation.
Donna McEvoy, director of housing at Cornwall Housing, said she was worried about whether the house could be saved.
She said: “It was a nightmare for people here and I don’t think people should live like this.
There are a number of circumstances to consider, as this property is likely to come to the fore as a “not-so-nice part” of Cornwall.
The family is infamous and their names are infamous.
The couple has three sons who occasionally stayed in the house, and police said the family's reign of terror included street battles using baseball bats, intimidation of surrounding residents, drug use, drug distribution, and loud shouting, fights, and bribery.
Skeldon (47), whose name was mentioned on the lease, was sentenced in June for anti-social behavior.
In several rooms in the house, which may be demolished, smelly waste was found.
In the house from which drugs were distributed in the past, there was a torn floor covering
Neighbours say they saw them on the street as they marched, and people regularly called the police here.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of the house this week after they were given an additional 11 weeks to voluntarily move out.
The neighbors, who were relieved, welcomed the emigration with the fact that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, "They didn't care about anybody at all."
We lived next door to them for 20 years and it was always like this.
How many times we've seen the police here, you can't count at all.
"We couldn't sleep this morning."
We got up because there was an incredible silence - we're not used to it!
It'll be nice when they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, a supervisor at Cornwall Housing, said the family was unable to work with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the house was regularly called to the police
Waste and old toys were dumped in an overgrown part of the town hall
He adds: “It is a shame that the tenant was unable to accept responsibility for her own behaviour and for the behaviour of her family. Emigration is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
It was a very complex case, because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to the witness, had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team has done, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the members of the local community who have bravely informed us.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time carry with it the message that we will not tolerate non-social behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the tenant who lived in the house at different times were about 20 years old.
Contaminated mattress, which after removal remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house
Workers will now have to remove piles of waste that have been dumped around the house.
In 2014, she carried out shelves in the house of raziya and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weight, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was fined when she was found guilty of possession of a class B drug she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was earmarked for the foundations of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to evict tenants who violate the rules of their leases
Angela Crow of Denov and Cornwall Police said the move was a clear message to other tenants who will continue to break the rules.
"This is a message to all those who think they can behave with impunity, and to those who would like to follow such behaviour," she said.
The Denov and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and unsocial behavior and will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal horrified by low-flying military jet over beach
Tourists who enjoyed the sun’s rays in Portugal’s Aveiro were terrified to death
The P-3C Orion, a Portuguese military aircraft, was flying incredibly low.
The Air Force said it was a training flight and insisted there was no threat to security.
As the low-flying jet drifted over a crowded beach, frightened tourists panicked.
Dramatic footage shows a military plane reaching almost to the touch of the sun on a sandy beach near the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
Tourists began to get up after being disturbed by the noise of jet engines, without seeing what emerges from the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon on the Costa Nova near the city of Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of several vacationers who posted videos of the dramatic flyby on social media, said: “The plane flew twice really low and at one point it seemed to crash.”
Nuno Arroja adds, “I was surfing and I really thought the plane was going to fall on my head.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when a low-flying plane appeared from the darkness
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing vessels off the coast and had to bear down because that was the only way to check the vessels.
The plane reportedly flew slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires. However, the aircraft insists that the safety of the people was not compromised.
Forest fires this summer destroyed part of mainland Portugal and claimed the lives of four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low because of the thick fog and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing.
The aircraft was on a training flight and the pilot was asked to identify fishing vessels as part of the training.
Half of funeral services do not comply with regulations.
Half of funeral service providers do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspection (<0xC4><0x8C>OI) found this during the inspections in the second quarter.
Funeral services, according to her, most often do not inform the survivors about their prices or do not issue a written confirmation of the receipt of the order.
For this, the IOC imposed 41 fines worth a total of CZK 73,000.
It was reported today by her spokesman, Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Fr<0xC3><0xB6>hlich.
The inspectors found errors in 47 of the 95 controls.
In addition to non-notification of prices and lack of confirmation, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than those agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly marked and once the seller used an officially unverified meter.
The inspection therefore prohibited the sale of 23 products for a total of CZK 7077.
It concerned the packaging of urns, candle cases and vases, which were not properly marked with mandatory information.
"Given that there is still a violation of the law in this specific area of services, the control action will continue in the next quarter of this year," Fr<0xC3><0xB6>hlich added.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS has been killed in Syria.
It was reported that Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnim Akunjee said the family learned of her death in Syria's Raqqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that she was likely killed during a Russian airstrike in Rakke, which is a stronghold of the group in the country.
The Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was preparing to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
“One wants to believe that the only good thing about the whole thing — as a message and warning to others that these are the real dangers associated with going to the war zone — is that it will deter people from ever making a decision,” Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria – and had been widowed within months.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, she will leave Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Senate Democratic Party leader Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton nominates Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court in the event of her election.
Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garland’s nomination, even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel says the person who replaces the late Supreme Court Justice will be elected by the future president.
During a conference call on Thursday, Reid said he believed Clinton would choose Garland "with some degree of credibility."
Reid's spokesman later said he did not directly talk to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland, and that he was only speculating.
He praised Garland and said that the Clinton team would not want to “rozhoupat the ship” by choosing someone else.
Garland is the president of the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans who are blocking Garland’s nomination are “obedients” and “jumping” Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump is not fit for office.
According to Treats magazine, there are nude calendars for "women and men"
Treats magazine is working closely with photographer David Bellemer on the release of the 2017 calendar, inspired by the Pirelli calendar from the 1970s.
But instead of revealed celebrities trying to find the next generation of top models for their calendar 2017 NU Muses.
President of Treats Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his nude magazine is different from the old-school Playboy because “Playboy is for men.”
I do it for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is, too.
“We need to go back to displaying timeless and classic nudity, where women and men feel comfortable and are inspired by photographs of the female body,” Shaw said in a press release.
Women want to be a part of this project because it is a wonderful piece of art.
Models can submit their pictures online or in person during open contests in Los Angeles and New York.
Where does vinyl go: who really buys turntables?
Vinyl is loved by lonely middle-aged men.
Before you decide to fill the comments section with peppery comments under the pseudonym NotAllIndividualsMen of Middle Age, we would like to point out that this statement is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, so much discussed resurrection of turntables is associated not with the boom of millennials who want to love the originality of ownership of a physical object, but with nostalgia of the Middle Ages.
Those who have recently purchased a vinyl album are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It’s not even about gathering an enthusiastic fan – it’s all about the emotional dimension: older people who buy turntables are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56% versus 53%) and are happy to be alone (69% versus 66%).
But are YouGov’s results true?
If this blog was broadcast as a television reportage, I would be watched by a camera as I go off to a busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray suit and gesticulating broadly. Then I would stop, raise my hands and say something authoritative, like, "Let's take a look at this."
So let's take a look at it.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and charm - buildings once occupied by independent vendors, are now filled with hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, confectionery and office supplies - several fantastic specialty stores with turntables still remain.
I would probably ask the camera to stop shooting for a while. I will stand close to the different men in these shops and try to observe what their age and emotional mood is.
Stuart (55), a native of Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (counts: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (counts: eight middle-aged men, one woman about 20) has an afternoon meeting in London and he watches his shops for several hours to get out.
I asked him if he was a collector.
"I think so," he says.
I've got about three or four thousand records.
All these recordings border the walls of his living room - in the picture above (he sent me the photo by e-mail, I did not follow him home).
He also has this huge amount of albums and singles because he can afford it: he can now buy turntables that he couldn’t afford when they were originally released, and he buys back what he sold when he was young and didn’t even have a wink.
"A lot of what I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s. These are things that would have been issued when I was 11 or 12.
He agrees that those who buy the recordings are probably introverts, who like to socialize themselves. He adds: “I don’t smoke or drink much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that a number of customers he meets fit into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new influx of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt forced to buy their old turntables back.
According to my interviews, people mostly got rid of their collections between 1998 and 1999.
Customers who once sold their turntables and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy back their turntables,” he says.
This could explain the boom of lovers of turntables of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional importance of turntables?
It won’t take you more than a few seconds to find out in a store like Phonica that you’ll find a nice community of people with similar thinking in the music stores.
According to Weze, some older customers are particularly affected by the contactless payment system.
Some fans of turntables may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have opted for the familiar environment of turntable packaging, things that evoke memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling a gap or owning something material can bring some comfort,” Wez says.
I'm a collector myself, and I think a lot of people do too.
It's an easy way to fill a place in your head.
"We're all like their social workers!" says a collaborator from a pile of turntables.
An ICM survey in April found that nearly 50% of people who had bought a vinyl album a month earlier had not listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of respondents have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy turntables do not.
At this point in the story, he was probably looking seriously worried about going through a bunch of bossa nova compilations.
The “trophy” aspect and the revival of interest is something Jonny (42) noticed working on Sounds of the Universe (number: three middle-aged men).
“Someone came in recently and said, ‘I don’t have a turntable yet, but I want to buy it on Radiohead so we can put it on the shelf,’” he says.
The percentage is not high, but it happens.
It’s more about the product page than the music.
People come to us and say, "I don't have a gramophone."
These are the younger people, not the older, grown-up teenagers who are getting into it.
Fopp, where almost an entire floor is currently reserved for gramophone records, has much more diverse visitors on my arrival.
There are couples of 70s, tourists who take pictures, teenagers and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere isn’t as laid-back as the shops used to be – with speakers instead of rolling jazz calling out the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it’s good to see a variety of customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it’s hard to estimate the emotional trauma when you’re standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) spends a few minutes in Fopp and looks at various gramophone records at a discount.
She's one of those people who's more likely to look at her expenses than spend it feverishly.
According to her, she doesn’t make much money, so she doesn’t think that she would collect gramophone records.
It costs a lot of money.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or something, but turntables have their magic...," he sighs longingly.
I can't explain it - it's unique.
My last stop is the store that supposedly inspired a new generation of gramophone record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
I pretend to be very interested in girls in tight jeans and I watch a group of teenage girls who are just gathering around Polaroid cameras. Then my father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley turntable.
To the left is a staircase whose wall is covered by the gramophone records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of gramophone records.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they're just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they can't be reached.
It's just a vinyl trick.
But since any attraction to him could mean more money for the industry and send several customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is not much to complain about.
It’s no surprise that a demographic area where there’s probably more time and money than in other areas is also where you spend the most on the most luxurious goods that vinyl certainly is.
But while, according to my findings, the results of YouGov seem to be accurate – at least in record stores, they don’t take into account the large number of vinyl collectors and lovers that actually exist, in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or in offices.
He certainly doesn’t spend Thursday morning wandering around the record stores on Berwick Street, going through recordings, and avoiding the sight of a strange, thirty-year-old fake TV presenter who hides behind the backs of nothing-knowing middle-aged men.
Greenland shark is the longest-living vertebrate - videoreport
According to scientists, the Greenland shark has the longest average life expectancy of all vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says the recording shows a female whose age is estimated to be between 272 and 512 years old and is five meters tall.
A French court has refused to take down shops in a refugee camp in the jungle.
A court in France has rejected an order by authorities in Calais to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the jungle camp where thousands of refugees live.
During a court hearing this week, authorities in Calais argued that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 temporary stores where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts, sell tea for 50 cents or basic food in temporary restaurants.
The prefect’s office in Calais argued that the sites needed to be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes and because they pose a risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations in court said that shops and restaurants are vital and that the free meals offered by state-sponsored associations and other groups do not provide food supplements for the growing numbers of refugees in the camp.
Disputed provisional shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to people in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis that would prevent people from running 72 provisional shops, but said that the objections of the prefect of Calais were "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants have a much greater role than simply serving food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said that the premises provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by demolition was a coffee shop in the camp, Jungle Book Kids, run by a non-profit organization that offers 200 meals a day, hours of English and French, and asylum counseling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed the petition to protect the “children’s” café.
The Guardian received a letter saying that closing the cafe “would be a disaster for these children, some of them as young as 8 years old.”
The charity Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of refugees in the camp, after a steep increase in arrivals over the summer, had risen to more than 9,000 - the most so far in all time.
You thought he was dead.
Ul<0xC4><0x8D> crosses himself and the volleyball <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
"Since March, I have been able to train normally," he said at the start of the summer training in full force.
What's wrong with you?
I had a bilateral pulmonary embolism, and that's why I had heart problems.
Because when I was in college in Korea, I didn't know I had any blood problems.
So the trouble caused a long flight to Asia?
I had a stroke in my calf for two years, and I didn't know it.
It hurt, no one found anything.
Then the crash came up.
There is a damaged vein in the calf, which will hurt all the time, especially when the weather is changing.
But nothing that would limit me, more of an aesthetic thing.
Were you worried about life?
He did.
Last year at the summer tournament in D<0xC5><0x99>ev<0xC4><0x9B>nice I did not know that I had an embolism, and I could not move there at all.
I spilled blood tonight.
The doctors told me it was something completely different, I was still five days completely done.
I really thought I was dead in the Woods, even my girlfriend and family.
I've seen you somewhere else.
How did you come up with that?
I guess I had to go through it, now it's just going up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I have to be more careful when I fly somewhere.
But you can do anything with it.
Just when I wanted to go back to P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>brami preparation last year, there were still heart problems.
It's all right now.
I have been preparing myself at home since March to be able to play again.
I'll knock it off, physically I'm better at it than I was before.
What do you expect from <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>?
I'm glad the party looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two strangers who are coming.
I hope we sit down humanly to make it fit together.
Will you pick up <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>?
She had a reputation for being a bully, but every season is different.
Brno was eight years ago, now the second one is over.
There is a new team in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>, there are only a few players left.
It was the last one to be extradited, so there's plenty of room for improvement.
How we use it is up to us.
We'll see after the first laps who's gonna be the loser, we'll probably not.
Is Coach Brom a guarantee of success?
He's already experienced and experienced a lot, he'll think of a better place than last.
But my arrival didn't have anything to do with it, I made a deal earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, with one I am a great friend and it was agreed that he would work here.
I won't say the name.
Finally Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He's got a big name, he's been in good clubs, he's been training for a lot of decades, he's a former good player.
Move us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I like to fight, I like to joke and I like to get an opportunity in a not so top team.
I was in P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bra for two years, but <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, Australian Boehm is already training in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
What's it look like?
I know him by the way, at the university we played against each other in the group.
And we used to hang out there a couple of times, we used to sit together sometimes the night after the games, so we already know each other in a friendly way.
We beat them 3:1, I immediately put it on him at the start of summer training in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD>.
He has a Slovak girlfriend, he's a nice guy.
The American Nadazdin and the Brazilian Ze will arrive.
Do you know anything about them?
I've been writing with an American, he looks like a nice guy, a Brazilian who knows how to speak English.
You contacted an American?
It seemed like a good idea.
I'm a recording artist, so I'm supposed to communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out what kind of player he is, I found out on the internet how he plays, I saw some videos.
He looked pretty good, the kid jumps, he's tall.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, he seemed like a joke, he would come to us.
How are you looking forward to the position of the record number one?
I didn't want to take anything else.
After all, I'm twenty-four and I don't have the nature to go for a change.
I'd rather be the center of the action, I'd rather lead the team than be led by someone else.
I guess I don't want to play anymore if I'm supposed to be like the second record player and do it full-time.
How many times have you been one?
Half a year in P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram, when it was not possible for Kust as captain, he got injured, then there were problems with money and he left.
Since then we've been climbing up and I've been playing all the time.
In Brno, of which I am an educator, I alternated one and two.
A great year was in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and I chose P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>bram.
From there Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice wanted me, I stayed, but I did not finish the season because of the embolism.
Now it's a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short bed remains Phelps' domain.
"Being back on the podium and hearing the anthem is sweet as ever," Phelps laughed, his eyes full of tears again.
His fiancee and mother again rejoiced in the sight, Boomer's son this time sleeping quietly with the headphones on his ears.
I'm having an incredible week at the end of my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started swimming racing and in a few hours it will be all over, he said excitedly.
In the final behind Phelps by almost two seconds, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino, who won the long bench, was behind.
The bronze was won by Chinese Wang Shun, a bronze medalist in this discipline from last year's World Cup.
After Alu Oerter (disc) and Carl Lewis (distant), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to master the same discipline in four consecutive games.
For most of the race, Phelps was led by fellow American Ryan Lochte and home team Thiago Perreira.
While the defender of the gold in the final curling fiftieth set to the crushing finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one more chance in Rio to expand his unique medal collection.
Shortly after the announcement of the sofa, he advanced to the final of the race for 100 meters of butterflies.
The legend could not be overshadowed by the compatriot Ryan Murphy, who won the double - after a hundred he won the double track in Rio.
In the final he left behind 37 sets of Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkin, the third was finished by Rus Yevgeny Rylov.
While last year’s World Cup saw Murphy take only fifth place out of the 200, in Rio he became the king of signage.
From the imaginary throne, he shot down Larkin, who managed the same double at last year's world championship.
He won a medal at the Olympics just now.
Canadian Penny Oleksiakov<0xC3><0xA1> and American Simone Manuelov<0xC3><0xA1> shared the gold in the hundreds.
For sixteen-year-old Oleksiak, it was the fourth medal at these games, for Manuela the second after the silver from the relay.
She won the Olympic gold medal as the first African-American woman in history.
I believe I can be an inspiration to others.
“This medal is for all those who come after me, the sport becomes love for them and they get to where I am,” Manuel said.
The third was the Swedish Sarah Sj<0xC3><0xB6>str<0xC3><0xB6>m, who won the 100-meter butterfly race in Rio and still has the silver from the bowling alley.
Australia's Cate Campbell has finished sixth in the world record.
Japan’s Rie Kanet won the bronze medal, which was the first Olympic medal at the age of twenty-seven.
It has no precious metal nor of the world championships, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russia’s Yulia Jefimovova, who, despite her doping record, is facing a backlash from spectators and rivals for the start of the games.
I made a big mistake once.
But I won in court, and I don't know why I should keep answering these questions.
"I'm so tired of it," said the Russian swimmer.
She won the right to start in Rio only with a special CAS sports arbitration panel just before the start of the games.
They dealt with my appeal and I won.
Whether someone likes it or not, or if they have a different opinion, let them turn to the arbitral tribunal, she added.
Hermann: Disappointment, we could have won.
And start at midnight?
I don't remember that.
The Czechs had a special day.
It was less than an hour before the match that they learned who they were up against.
They must have mastered tactical training.
And then, in an unconventional time, the game began on the small court number 1.
The first set did not start well, then they reached the lead of the opponent, but at 19:19 they did not manage to finish.
In the second they were clearly better and even, but the decisive tie-break did not work out for them.
In particular, a number of the services shown meant a 10:15 loss and a farewell to the Olympic tournament.
"We could have beaten the Russians," Hermann said.
How would you rate the match?
Hermann: After an unlucky start before I played, we got into the game beautifully.
In the end, in the last balloon, I received an income that I was used to.
We lost a hundred, which was key.
In the next set, we stepped on them with an overview of the pitch, another defense and pushed on the service.
In the tie-break there was a terrible mess of submissions, there we wore on this page.
It was a disappointment because we could beat the Russians.
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: It's a shame the first set started, we ran away.
We were able to download it, but we missed the dots.
The second set was great and the third set decided the service.
We've made too many mistakes.
We gave them five points and about the five it was, there we had a lot of hesitation.
It's a shame, because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the little castle number 1?
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: Similar to China in the adjoining courtyards.
The environment and atmosphere were different.
There was an hour in the night, complete silence, music playing, nowhere.
That was the difference from the center.
We would not choose such conditions, but we cannot choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found out the names of the opponents an hour before the match?
Hermann: It was strange.
We started training for the game without knowing the opponents, so we couldn’t do the tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon (Bay Nausch) prepared the tactics for almost all the options that were there.
He had a lot of tactical papers ready, so on this page we were pretty well prepared.
Do you remember that you would ever start a game at midnight?
Hermann: Probably not.
We played at half past eleven, but not at twelve.

Beach volleyball players Markéta Slukov<0xC3><0xA1> and Barbora Hermannov<0xC3><0xA1> hugging in the pre-season play-off at the OH in Rio.
Was it uncomfortable?
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: By playing the last two matches in the group of ten, we had the regime moved earlier.
That was two more hours.
It’s strange, I can’t imagine that another sport has athletes who have to give their best performance at twelve o’clock.
But I think we prepared as well as we could.
We knew it would be, but it's not typical and it probably won't be my favorite time to play.
How do you feel about the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the progress of the group was our goal, it is on the one hand okay, good.
We did what we said.
But now I'm sad after the game.
Slukov<0xC3><0xA1>: I will sleep on it and from tomorrow I will remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big brother's here, the first spying SIM's coming.
You won't escape her.
The new rules are intended to apply to all persons without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM card from one of the local operators while staying in Thailand.
That is, not only for tourists, but also for people with long-term visas who, for example, work in Thailand or have married there.
The Secretary General of the Office of National Broadcasting and the Telecommunication Commission, Takorn Tantasith, has informed that there will be no exceptions.
The sale plan for SIMs intended exclusively for foreigners was presented by the national telecommunications regulator at the beginning of August.
The authorities intend to introduce new measures to monitor their position within six months.
According to Tantasit, it is a means of maintaining national security, which will allow to solve the criminal activity committed by foreigners.
In addition, so-called tourist SIMs help to detect people who exceed the allowed length of stay.
Within six months, there should be a special SIM for foreigners along with a SIM intended exclusively for Thais.
The difference will be the tracking function, which will be permanently turned on for cards intended for people without a Thai passport.
It won't be possible to turn it off.
"This SIM feature is not for Thais because we can always easily track you," Tantasith added.
It should be added that in Thailand, the prepayments are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires proof of identity.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators gave free starting SIM to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
Ten telecom regulators from other Asian countries, including Malaysia and Singapore, are also considering introducing the same measure as Thailand.
They are also currently subject to mandatory SIM registration, however, the legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the measures taken do not mean an obligation for a foreigner to acquire a local operator when entering the SIM country.
Of course, they can use roaming services with their own home SIM, in which case the Thai authorities will be short on them.
The operators of the country in question only know the relevant network information after crossing the border, i.e. after the SIM has been logged into their network.
They know the phone number, but not the owner’s information.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to the rates of local operators is so dire that even most tourists during their stay in Thailand will start to look for local SIMs.
Efforts by the authorities to monitor the movement of foreigners have received legal criticism from foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in the context of privacy, the system prepared compares to the obligation to provide a residential address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if there is a need to monitor a specific person.
Any misuse of the system will be subject to an unspecified penalty.
"If a service provider tracks the SIM location without a court order, he will be charged with a crime," Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While a specific number will not be recycled until after the 90-day period after which the SIM has not logged in to the network has expired, a new one could be restored after 15 days if it leaves Thailand.
Luxury apartment in a new building in Vinohrady has a swimming pool and a hot tub on the terrace.
Why did you choose an apartment in a new building?
We were looking for a carefree apartment, where most of the real estate care is provided by the manager.
The condition was enough parking spaces and an elevator in the house, which basically disqualified the older building.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with floor swinging, high energy demands and the like.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old building is not able to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern apartment.
The whole interior was designed for you by architect Lenka Langerov<0xC3><0xA1> and her colleague Kamila Pol<0xC3><0xA1>kova from the Artiga studio.
Why did you just call them?
Would you recommend working with an expert to anyone?
We would recommend cooperation with the architect to anyone, if he proposes an apartment from the beginning, it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the design of the interior itself: designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials and, based on the client's wishes, are able to properly align the interior.
We already worked with architect Lenka Langer on our mountain apartment, based on the personal recommendation of another client, and since everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us even during the reconstruction of our new apartment in Vinohrady.
What were your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-living space with adequate facilities for a four-member family, conceived as a modern, but not a cool interior.
The priority was to achieve the connection of the apartment with the terraces and to realize intelligent control of the household.
And, of course, the quality of the execution had to be monitored.
Did you leave everything to the experts, or did you intervene in the final form of the interior?
We approved all designs, including technical drawings and samples of materials, but the design always came from architects.
At the beginning, we determined what we expected from the design, and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to incorporate into the design, such as carpets or paintings.
I think that it was our collection of mostly Czech authors, including works by Karl Malich, Karl Vysusila, V<0xC3><0xA1>clav <0xC5><0xA0>p<0xC3><0xA1>la or Otto Gutfreund, who helped the architect orient herself in our taste.
Also, the combination of black, white and walnut wood was the idea of the architect as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floor, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. Whether everything fits together, we then checked together using visualizations.
Were there any complications that led you to give up your original ideas or, on the contrary, to adopt new ones?
Perhaps only in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building at the moment when it was possible for the first time to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the views we planned, in fact, shade the surrounding building.
Then we literally changed the mood overnight from the ground up.
On the kitchen line and on the lining of the fireplace wall was used granite.
The interior is dominated by wooden surfaces complemented by leather, for example on the upholstery of the dining and bar chairs Norma by Arper.
How would you characterize the interior?
Are you making any changes or is there something you would like to have differently today?
I believe that it is a modern air interior, which above all fulfills its purpose.
We are not going to make changes, most of the adjustments after moving in took place in the level of shading and housing terraces.
Perhaps the only excuse is to the floor, when the walnut wood shows itself to us as too sensitive to the house with the dog.
Word architects, Ing. arch. Lenka Langerov<0xC3><0xA1> and MgA. Kamila Hornychov<0xC3><0xA1>, authors of the realization.
The apartment is on the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to carry out a completely new layout solution and several other modifications within the building.
For the interior, an important element is the placement of light guides into the ceiling of the hallway and the main toilet.
This gave us daylight into the darker areas of the apartment.
Also the direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building modifications that was very beneficial for the function of the whole apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a hot tub.
Compared to the French, you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You come from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, near the Spanish border.
I've moved quite a bit.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
In France, I studied journalism, which led me to work in a magazine.
So why did you decide to move out of the country?
I started to feel like I was drowning in France.
I just didn't want to live there anymore.
Mainly because of the atmosphere between people.
It seemed to me that every Frenchman is very negative.
People in France are in a negative mood in general, but recently it has worsened.
It is interesting that you mention negativity.
This is how some people value the Czech nature.
Trust me, you're not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not get it when they come to France, because they don’t see it as much as tourists.
But it was too much for me.
The big issue is money.
People feel that they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which in my opinion is enough.
Now there is a problem with people’s behavior towards Muslims.
That's totally incomprehensible to me.
For example, in the street where I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor started looking at me through my fingers just because I was a Muslim.
Like I'm some kind of evil.
That's why I didn't feel good in France.
But my family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for work basically anywhere else and I found a job at Air France here in Prague.
I have to admit that I did not know Prague at all from the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me about what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I did not know what to expect from Prague.
I've been here three years now, and I can't imagine not living here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Mainly because of a completely different atmosphere.
Maybe it’s because I don’t speak Czech, so I can’t capture any negative reactions or impulses, but I feel like there are more free people here.
That I can do anything, dress anything, and no one will judge me.
In France, someone is always looking at you unpleasantly, even if you have special clothes and the like.
I started to feel really free in Prague.
I don't think the wankers care about that sort of thing.
Where do you work now?
After working at Air France, I worked for a while for one travel website.
Then, together with a friend, we set up a website where people offer and search for shared housing.
So far, we are only operating in Prague, but we would like to extend it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here, who are Czechs from the middle, and two more Czech friends.
I have to say that another specificity of the Czechs is that at the beginning they are more distant.
He won't let anyone get to his body right away.
It’s quite different from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses their face.
Here it is different, but I understand that it is a cultural matter, so I try to adapt.
You mentioned that you don't speak Czech.
Is the language barrier a problem for you?
On the contrary, it is quite simple in Prague, because perhaps everyone here speaks English.
Even at dinner parties or in food.
I would like to learn Czech, but I don’t have that much time.
And since everyone can communicate at least a little bit in English, I don’t need to learn the language quickly.
And every time I have a problem, there's someone to help me.
Have you had any negative reactions as well?
Is it because you are a Muslim?
No, not really.
Perhaps it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience comes to mind.
My manager, the Czech Republic, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: After all, it’s not the French, it’s the Africans.
That touched me quite a bit.
But that someone would have a problem with me being a Muslim, that hasn't happened to me yet.
And this despite the fact that a colleague once warned me about some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He told me not to go to the center, that they'd give me a ride there.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly linked to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something similar to Paris, Nice or Brussels could happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is, nowadays, anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I could not have imagined that such a thing would happen in France.
This is not just about Muslims.
Moreover, Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me, the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Quran says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you feel when terrorists protect themselves with your faith?
It's very hard.
I feel shame and guilt, even though I shouldn't feel that way at all.
I try not to follow the news of violence too much, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that is not really my fault.
I'm a completely different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met in the square of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> z Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad.
On Wednesday, Czech Muslims and Christians protested against the violence.
Did you register it?
I didn't know that.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they do not agree with violence.
I don't think they'd have to do anything like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they didn’t do?
Do you meet other Muslims in Prague?
My colleagues, for example, are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
They are a little more religiously based than I am, so we sometimes have quite wild discussions about Islam because we all perceive it a little differently.
I come from France, so I went through a different education, maybe they learned Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes associate Islam with the subordinate status of a woman.
How do you feel about that?
I don't think I'm submissive in any way.
Rather the opposite.
I'm a woman, I have strength.
It also means that you don’t have to wear a head covering.
For example, hijab?
And it's mostly about the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a very principled Muslim.
He prays five times a day, but he just doesn't wear a scarf.
She has always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on how everyone interprets it.
When a person reads the Qur'an, he should make his own opinion on it.
So when I read a passage in the Qur’an that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself: I am not the wife of the Prophet, so why should I hide?
On the other hand, I respect it, and when I travel to Iran or Saudi Arabia, for example, where the scarves are required, I will take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far, yes.
I didn't feel so good anywhere else.
I’ve been thinking about Poland for a while, but I’m doing great in Prague.
I can even imagine raising my own children here.
Prague is the ideal city for this.
Czech Muslims and Christians protested against the violence.
Sailor Kozelsk<0xC3><0xA1> Fenclov<0xC3><0xA1> wind in Rio fell on the step-by-step crossings.
Friday trips to the sea in Rio de Janiero, Brazil, were made by Czech yachter Veronica Kozelsk<0xC3><0xA1> Fencl<0xC3><0xA1>.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved to tenth place in front of the final two starts.
This would ensure Czech participation in the final race.
You collect packets like Pokémon.
They want to compete with the carriers.
The idea of using the already planned routes for the transportation of shipments is the TV director Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka and the manager of the Prague music club Marek Greger.
The idea was breathed into the lives of three applications with different geographic reach.
We launched the national Transport app in May.
At the moment, there are thousands of cities recorded in it and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn this first, before we focus more on abroad, says the forty-year-old manager in an interview for iDNES.cz.
How does the Transfer App work and who can benefit from it?
You can download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and details of how big a package you can transfer and how much you want for it.
Someone else is asking for a ride that day.
When the route and the delivery time are convenient, it is paired and the two come to each other's notice.
At that moment, the chat will open, where the couple will arrange a handover.
How many people do you think would need to register to make sure that each package always finds its own courier?
I do not know the ideal condition, I can not estimate how many registered and how many trips it takes to cover completely optimal and each offer is matched with the demand.
On the main roads it already works and it is logically easier than on the way between the villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People are also building trust and finding that no one is running away with the package.
So far, you haven't had to deal with such a case?
How many users does the service have two months after launch?
Currently, we have about 5-6 thousand people who create the paths.
We believe this to be a success and we believe that more will be added.
Isn't there a danger that the sender will wait too long?
We hope that we will be competing for large conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the item, for example, on the same day and for a fraction of the price.
For a large company, you will pay several thousand for delivery within two hours.
You'll pay a hundred dollars or less here, because that's the way someone's already doing it.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about the possible loss of customers in the future?
We hope that's the case.
The market has huge potential, it feeds huge multinational carriers here, as well as the retail chain where they all started shopping and gradually found that the quality does not correspond to what it pays for.
No one wants to find a note in the mailbox that says they have a shipment to pick up at the branch, first the day after 7 p.m.
By that time I had needed the package for six hours and I was waiting at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and more functional service that won’t bother anyone and sends a signal to the competition, no matter what they try.
Marek Greger (41) and Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka (39).
No one has ever worked in the field of information technology.
Marek Greger works as a manager of a music club, Mat<0xC4><0x9B>j Li<0xC5><0xA1>ka as a television director.
In 2014, they began to prepare the Shippansee LTD application, which uses already planned routes between world metropolises to transport packages, especially by plane.
In 2015, they commissioned a project to develop a company that created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or <0xC4><0x8C>SFD.
The programming took three-quarters of a year and the app was launched in March 2016.
The application of Transport began to develop in December last year and was released this year in May.
This is a local version of Shippansee adapted for the Czech market.
The Mes<0xC3><0xAD>k and Mes<0xC3><0xAD>k Profi apps have been developed since January of this year and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to make all these applications that will one day merge into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to fine-tune the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
The shared economy has been a topic lately and this is an AirBnB or Uber service.
Are you not afraid of working in an area that no one can say much about yet, where is the border of sharing and where is the grey economy?
It's the same, just a different product.
It is clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be another thorn in the eye through the grey economy.
But even if someone saves and someone makes a profit, it is not the intention to bypass financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, on one side or the other, will be encouraged to donate their income if they make it their income.
What do you think the service has so much potential?
The sender will save and the carrier will earn, respectively reduce the cost of travel.
That is the strong idea that unites interest on both sides.
In the age of social networks, which divide people, we would like this one to become closer.
There can be nice stories, people are happy that they have helped someone and they will talk about it.
Maybe someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
People have been lacking personal access for a long time, we say about this app that it is a service of people to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with the package does not leak?
Each user of the application, together with the registration, scans the ID card and indicates the bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give credibility to the service and to the person.
Couriers also collect stars based on ratings from senders.
We also offer insurance, we are still fine-tuning the details.
The courier is responsible for the uninsured shipment in case of loss or damage, but does not accept responsibility under criminal law for the content if there is something illegal inside and does not know about it.
If he is stopped by the police and found in a sealed package in his suitcase a gun or ten kilos of hashish, the criminal responsibility falls on the sender.
Is there a threat of misuse of sensitive data from the database?
They are registered if necessary and can be monitored by the administrative authority, which alone will have the opportunity to look into it, even we are not able to see them ourselves, the data is protected against misuse.
How much money does he get after successfully delivering the shipment to the courier's hand?
The courier determines the price and gets the full amount he can claim.
The sender is charged a few percent extra for contacting.
This money is our profit, but it is only a few percent, because we want to push on the volume.
The courier also can not accuse anyone that he did not deliver the shipment, when in fact he delivered it, the pick-up and delivery are verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
Whether in relation to the size or content of the package?
You can transfer anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cube of butter, medium as a plate of eggs and large as a bass beer.
Then there are no further restrictions and if someone has a seat in the car, they may take over the refrigerator.
Plus, the sender has the option to take a photo in the package application, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don’t even have to pack a thing if you don’t want to hide the content.
You put the forgotten sweatshirt in the courier's hand and that's it.
Who came up with the idea and how long did it take to start the service?
A friend got the idea more than two years ago, then I did not pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo application with a transnational reach that targets mainly the passenger plane.
At the time, I told him that I would not be looking for an investor, but I would like to become one myself and put savings into it.
The next year was a year of development before we established Shippansee LTD in London, due to the increased credibility of the entire product.
But this is not the version you are focusing on right now.
No, we focused our marketing on the Czech Republic, where we are trying to capture the application, because it all had birth pains and there is still something to solve and improve.
We try to respond to feedback from customers and we do not currently solve the foreign market as much.
We know it’s a long-distance race, but we don’t brag, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were an upgrade in their own way.
The transfer came about when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we will at least learn in the Czech Republic.
The third application of the Moon is local, for the city.
However, it can send the package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for senders as well as transport, but the difference is that as a courier you see shipments in the form of points on the map that are closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in your mobile.
The application for couriers who want to feed themselves with it, we called Messier Profi.
So anyone can make a good living by picking up packages around town?
Precisely, the last application will download in Prague, for example, a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to make a trip to work.
Just like everyone's crazy about these Pokémon right now, they can collect this the same way.
A person sees where there are orders around the city, comes to it, clicks and sees when it has to be delivered and the shipment takes over.
It is set up cheaper than competitive services.
At the moment, we are still making a web interface that will be crucial for companies to send shipments, fill in data about them on the website, or create points on the map.
We are then able to bill them for the use of the service every month.
Are you currently working on a full-time project?
It bothers us, but we normally have it at work so that we can take advantage of the project and develop it.
There is no hiding behind us a strong multinational investor, we are two guys, one of whom had a brilliant idea and the other jumped into it with other incentives and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to be able to walk with us not the Czech market, but who should go with us to the global product and become another huge player in the market such as AirBnB and Uber.
The story part of Titanfall 2 is supposed to bring almost forgotten diversity.
This will fix the second part and the solo game in it will be according to the first information more varied than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours, and the filling should be based on the concept of grid fill in the first part.
Therefore, you can look forward to the freedom of movement, which in addition to running includes the possibility of using combat titanium.
In addition to the action passages, the game will contain levels focused on the revolving movement.
They will resemble platformers and include rebuses.
To overcome them are therefore essential, for example, double jumps, running around the walls and rope slide.
Sometimes it will also be necessary to eliminate the enemies.
There will be no shortage of maps reminiscent of mazes and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and pull platforms and close massive doors.
Edit so you will be the form of the battlefield.
The pace of the game should oscillate between furious action and quieter moments for exploring the unknown planet.
We're going to be playing Jack Cooper's pawn dreaming of a career as a pilot.
At the start of the campaign, Cooper and Captain Lastimosa are defeated on the alien planet Typhon, which is inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And there will not be a wild beast there to be merciful to him.
In addition, Lastimosa sustains mortal wounds in the crash, and Cooper is given the task of running the captain's titan.
His dream of a career as a pilot will come true sooner than he expected.
The first step, however, will be to steal the battery needed for the robot’s repair.
Cooper's calls to the titan will also be significant.
It will serve as a source of information for players about the soldier’s past, but at the same time, humorous moments will be created by robotic isolated communication.
For example, when the titanium is dry, it will name all the injuries Cooper is facing in a planned jump.
The first information about the campaign in Titanfall 2 was provided by the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be possible to assess in two months and Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions of the network game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 will be released on October 28th for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand will come to life, but the original publisher remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic is changing its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of THQ in 2013, it acquired a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and the name of the company.
For example, Nordic has released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and the Red Faction Collection.
In addition, 23 more games are being created for the publishing house, 13 of which have not yet been revealed by the company.
Thirty years ago, at the time of my retirement, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a twenty-year-old man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first she obviously tried for a long time, then they got together.
He's such a big guy, maybe her type, because she went with a guy like that in front of me.
She went completely mad at him.
In the first days, her voice even changed, she had such a girly, in love voice.
But when I told her I knew what was going on, she denied it.
But I've been watching it all.
He then left work regularly at half past three, so she always left at three to go shopping.
Every day she tried to at least see him.
Later, I found out they were meeting at his house, in the laundry room.
How many times did I know they were there?
I got the keys, he was determined to get them there.
But I don't know why, in the end I always stayed at home.
I've never been able to go there, to take the decisive step.
You may laugh at me, but I believe my wife controlled me in thought.
She soon found out that I was controllable, that I was going to do what she wanted.
And I really did.
Maybe I'm just a jerk.
At the time, my neighbors told me they knew about it.
I was such a fool that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke, it would be bad.
That it would happen to everyone in the family, only a daughter knew something.
So I've always put it off, over and over.
But one day I went to his apartment to get some help in the laundry room.
He went there with me and I told him that I had been given an anonymous address, that he was meeting my wife and that he was witnessing everything.
I asked him what he would tell me.
He stood there, shrugged his shoulders, looked at the ground, and said not a word.
Then I also once met his wife on the way from the store.
I told her, but she didn't believe it.
She didn't react to it, and she didn't tell me anything.
Nobody told me anything back then.
I'm the kind of person who's never gone anywhere much, who has a problem getting to know someone, let alone finding a woman.
So I didn't even think about divorce.
I was always counting on it to end one day.
I thought I'd forgive her for everything and life would go on.
It wasn't like that.
And I basically never got over it.
I still have it in me.
I used to show it to her quite often, but in the end, I left it alone.
He still lives in the next house, and I still live with her.
It's more like my wife's my housekeeper.
She always did everything at home - cooking, washing, cleaning.
She's a hard worker.
I’ve always wanted to make sure I had no other reason to complain.
And you could say she's good, too.
But sometimes I want to hug her, hug her, and she won't let go.
We go for walks and shopping together and everyone thinks about what a happy marriage we have.
She told me once that she never loved me.
That she loved me and she loved me, but she didn't love me.
And I see that she still loves him, she's her god.
And I don't enjoy that kind of life.
Even when it started and I was carrying it very badly, I told her once that I didn’t want to live and I asked her what she would say to me if I ended it.
I wanted to know if she'd agree or not.
And that's what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or no.
But she thought, and finally said, "But there's plenty of room here."
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After the terrorist attacks, France is stepping up the fight against radical Islamists and the government and the local Muslim minority are calling for help.
"If Muslims themselves do not help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee freedom of religion," Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
It is intended to ensure that only the spiritual education in France is preached in the country.
He also wants to stop financing mosques from abroad, where money often comes from jihadist-infested preachers.
By October, Prime Minister Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation, which should serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by the then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
Already at that time it was supposed to contribute to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
Soon, however, she was struck by internal contradictions, and therefore she never functioned properly.
"It's a total failure," Valls said.
The new foundation will likely be headed by former Minister of the Interior and Defense Jean-Pierre Chev<0xC3><0xA8>nement, who is known as a supporter of the secular state.
There are about 2,500 mosques and prayerbens in France, about 120 of which serve radical Islam.
Since 2012, French authorities have expelled about 80 Islamic clerics from the country, and several dozen others are considering the move.
This week, the German police also intervened against the jihadist clerics.
The imams reportedly recruited fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in January 2015, a debate broke out in France over a new institution to replace the dysfunctional foundation.
All this has accelerated other terrorist attacks carried out on behalf of the Islamic State by radical Islamists.
The new foundation will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic sources and also to supervise the imams.
However, it is not yet clear where it will get its funding, despite several proposals being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal food, i.e. meat derived from defeats according to Islamic principles.
In practice, this tax would be paid by the sellers to halal food, and this is for granting permission.
Part of the money would then go directly to the foundation’s budget.
A contribution of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 could also be paid by French pilgrims travelling to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 of them leave France for a traditional trip to Saudi Arabia.
Moreover, in French mosques, only preachers who have passed the educational programs at the universities there should be active.
Because of this, their preaching should be in harmony with democracy.
The government is also shutting down radical mosques.
"Since December, we have closed 20 of them and more will follow," Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
“There is no place in France for those who declare hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men,” he said.
Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown gunman on Friday morning at a shopping mall in northern Spain's Zaragoza, the Independent newspaper reported.
The shooting took place after the woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of the shopping mall, from where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the gun on himself, writes the Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an uninjured daughter, an ambulance had to arrive for the men in critical condition.
The incident took place around 11 a.m. in the central part of the capital of the autonomous region of Aragon, near the local university.
With reference to the Spanish agency Europa Press, the Independent writes that the motive was probably the unresolved recent divorce of both partners.
Tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, guacamole, and mozzarella cheese.
Summer wishes for light, well-digestible food, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our own tastes and our own head.
And so from the summer gardens they smell of grilled neck, bacon, pork shank.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, sometimes with the exception of salad or roasted vegetables.
True, grilling is time-saving as well as dishes, moreover, it is a social matter and no one needs to be locked in the kitchen.
But there are also other alternatives, how to do well with delicacies that special dining, their preparation is a small ritual, but at the same time there is no need to cook, bake, fry or suffocate for a long time.
They will also contribute to our health.
Whether it's homemade sushi or sashimi, where quality raw materials and a few well-acquired griffins are enough to make preparation fun and food itself a truly exotic treat.
As well as even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
Here even more time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice is dispensed with.
The paper can only be softened in water for a moment and then it only depends on the imagination of the chef, how he intends to play with fillings and accessories.
There's no algae like algae.
The advantage of a number of dishes of Asian cuisine today is that raw materials are usually already available.
Including the pickled sweet and sour ginger, which is one of the basic flavors accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but the real pink garnish ginger has a unique spicy sharpness and at the same time a delicious taste thanks to a secret recipe, according to which it is mixed from several types of vinegar and ginger.
It is therefore enough to buy a bag of the appropriate size, and the annex with demonstrable antibacterial effects, supporting digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are mainly used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes as part of a variety of festive occasions and rituals.
The long ribbed banana leaves are very widespread in many countries of Asia or South America also as a "help" for the preparation of a variety of baked, cooked and fried foods, which are packaged in them similar to the alobal.
The banana leaf then transmits a specific flavor to the food.
In our stores you can buy exotic fruit and vegetables, even pre-cut into the shape of a wheel.
However, choose only the leaves of rich greenery, and therefore healthy - unroasted and without stains.
Similarly, it is easy to prepare salad from wakame lard, sesame and sesame oil.
It can be bought frozen again.
Who often eats or prepares sushi, probably will know especially the algae nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seaweed, from which it is made by cutting, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves, i.e. plates intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame, a dark green algae growing in the waters around Hokkaid<0xC3><0xB3> Island, is also fresh and dried and is as popular as the nori algae.
By the way, who does not know miso soup with wakame, allegedly Asian women use it long ago for recovery after childbirth.
And in general, this algae has effects almost miraculous.
It cleanses blood, strengthens blood circulation, even allegedly prevents graying of hair and is literally loaded with minerals.
Dried and crushed wakame also serves as a spice, for example to flavor rice.
Fresh algae are first allowed to leach in water, then rinsed, put in boiling water and cook for half a minute.
Then it cools in ice water, cuts out the center ribs and further adjusts, for example, as a favorite salad.
However, buying it already ready, frozen, is the easiest solution.
So all that remains is to wrap the roll with an easy vegetable filling, delicious and light, full of healthy flavors.
Such a bombshell of longevity.
If you resist and do not add an extra grilled casserole.
Eat healthy, light and summery.
Asians know how to do that.
Just a few special ingredients and a bit of dexterity, and you have an interesting fresh meal that deliciously combines taste.
And it's done in two.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white radishes, 100 g of green asparagus, 60 g of lettuce, 60 g of wakame algae and 60 g of sweet chilli sauce.
A handful of chopped coriander, a spoonful of black sesame, a spoonful of sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g of mango and 40 g of pickled ginger, some pine nuts.
First, we'll prepare the threads.
Soak the rice paper in cold water for five seconds.
Then we take it out and wait for it to soften.
Meanwhile, in hot water, cook the asparagus shoots for a short time, after about three minutes, let them cool quickly in ice water so they do not lose color.
On the allowed paper, put a filling of vegetables and wrap.
Prepare the filling from white radish, carrots and lettuce, cut into thin noodles, mix them with sweet chilli sauce, add chopped coriander, mix thoroughly and put on rice paper.
On a banana leaf, put asparagus shoots, add the threads and, at the end, decorate the whole dish with wakame lard, seasoned with ginger, a slice of manga, sprinkle with black sesame and add a couple of pine nuts.
Britain must settle for silver in seven-man rugby, Fiji picks gold
Britain's impressive seven-man rugby performance ended in a devastating lead on the final hurdle, with Fiji beating the British in the final match on Thursday night at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio 43:7.
The Fijians showed a masterful lesson in processing, stacking, bending, supporting play, line running, and brutal forces – and won gold, their first Olympic medal ever.
The defeat came with an unexpected price of consolation in the form of a silver medal - for Britain third in a given day - and the British could be proud of their achievements in the inaugural Olympic tournament of seven-man rugby, beating New Zealand, Argentina and the Republic of South Africa.
A win over South Africans 7:5 in the semi-finals on the same day may have froze in the final.
However, Fiji would have defeated the 15-member team in full health in its form.
It may not be comforting for the British, but they can be glad that at least one of them will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: the head coach of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon.
Great Britain has offended some of the way.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game in the Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one here.
This defeat may hurt, but progress is undeniable.
Fiji began magnificently, the penetrations of the British reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and the other teammates, it was like running behind a bunch of moving buses, and the World Cup champions led 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau emerged from behind the corner.
The timer showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing, from which the conversion was.
12:0 and Britain hardly touched the ball.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the giant Leon Nakarawa and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only the Fijians slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw the touchdown into the right corner and the British lost 17:0.
Nakarawa added another after returning and there was still more than 1 minute left in the clock... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then penetrated the malty Brits and landed on the line where he scored.
After the conversion to 29:0, the break followed.
It was as if Fiji was born for rugby 7s, while the British were still learning to pass.
That's the way it is.
The British made massive changes after halftime, and the Fijian effort stopped... for a full four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until after the brilliant interplay of Fiji, Joshua Tuisov penetrated further.
Dan Norton tried to get the opportunity for the British, threw the touchdown into the left corner to raise the an 36:7. However, the match had long since been won by the inhabitants of the Pacific islands and their fans sang, waved flags and danced.
It was hard not to admire the totally delighted approach of the Fijians.
In the final moments, Mata Viliam sweetened the victory of the Fijians with another attempt.
The whistle sounded, the Fijians hugged, and the British fell on the lawn completely exhausted.
Earlier that same day, Fiji beat Japan 20:5 in the semi-final and the United Kingdom beat South Africa in the tight semi-final - by the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans into the lead in the first half, but Dan Norton, thanks to his dazzling footwork, broke through the defensive line and scored in the second half under the hook.
Marcus Watson, Anthony’s brother from England’s 15th team, has secured a win – and eventually a silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win the rowing race inspired the coach’s battle with cancer
On these Games you will not find more emotional gold - and that's what to say.
From the first shot to the last, during 220 punitive outbursts in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found further meaning in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
Although there were two at the fair, there were three voices in the boat. When the boat was swinging across the surface to face the second Olympic gold behind it in the women's doubles race, there was still a voice in the boat of the still-present coach Robin Williams. They are the first women in the history of British sport to do so.
Their predominance was absolute, overall it was their 39th race in which they remained unbeaten.
What we see - two excellent athletes flying on the surface of the water with an elegant swan - does not reflect the nature of the victory completely.
For every gold medal in rowing, there is a battalion of auxiliary hands, which, piece by piece, make a difference. And no hands were more helpful than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago did not know if he would live to see this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer that can be operated on, and I underwent this operation.
Without surgery, anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
It will change your view of things a bit.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
The lucky thing for the whole trio was that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, off-season, and thus reduce the drop to a minimum - if we can call it that under such circumstances.
I needed to make money, so I had to put myself together quickly.
That was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it started.
Rowing by itself is a journey, but this has been a little more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts about Williams, who was very nervous in the morning, spoke less than usual as he tried to cope with his own unrest.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment, who is on a mission in Aghanistan, said: “This week I’ve been down with emotions, maybe it’s a bit extreme, but it means so much.”
Again, it underscores how much it means to me, how much Helen and I have worked together, and so has Robin.
So far, it's been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we wouldn’t be anyone, so he’s a huge thank you, he’s the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t have wished for a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a single race in five years.
The pair set a stunning rhythm that their rivals could not match.
Even in the final 500 meters, when the crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We were mostly focused at the time.
Helen shouted, "Don't stop, don't stop."
It's really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we did not want to achieve something famous.
We weren’t happy with today’s fireworks, we just wanted to do well, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a year to think before deciding what happens next.
Glover is getting married next week, and her next step is TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now he wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it would be my last race.
That would be too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new and I was so stressed out.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel much better about it," she said.

Jail?
Rather, let them drive people for free, says the taximafia hunter Rube<0xC5><0xA1> to the breakthrough lawsuit.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate’s official in Prague are, according to <0xC4><0x8C>T, accused.
You have made a number of reports in which you have exposed the fraudulent practices and those who are supposed to be in the group that will take place in court.
You've faced some unpleasant encounters with the actors you've exposed.
How powerful is the report on the prosecution of members of an organized group for you?
I was hoping there'd be a trial.
I'm mainly curious about the verdict.
But I don't think they should be in jail.
That's useless.
First of all, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should give them back so they can drive all the people for free.
That's a rather peculiar solution.
Does that mean that you don’t think the punishment is effective enough?
For me, it's enough that some of them are so afraid that they're not doing the job anymore.
For example, one pingles, another delivers pizza, and one completely quits.
In theory, defendants can get two to eight years in prison.
Do you think this is an adequate rate?
In general, I have a problem with deprivation of liberty.
I think it's a bad punishment.
Putting someone in jail, especially in this case, is nonsense.
Such people should return the companies they took from her.
For a quarter of a century, they have done what they did to destroy the name of our country and to rob people of their freedom.
So now let's make a good card and deliver people for free.
I can't imagine it any other way.
It would work as a public service.
As someone goes to collect waste, they would get a car and drive people around Prague for free.
No, I really think they'll eventually get a condition and they won't care.
They'll find another way to cheat somewhere.
He studied at the Miroslav Ond<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek Film Academy in P<0xC3><0xAD>sek and subsequently at the University of Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Bati in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>n.
It belongs to people who started with viral videos and videos directly for the web in the Czech Republic.
He works as an editor for the internet television stream.cz, where he participates in a number of programs, now he prepares the Prague Guide program, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
In the form of short reports, Rube<0xC5><0xA1> advises them on which services to avoid in Prague and which to use without fear.
Previously, he directed a series titled How to Do It, City of Scams?, Life in Luxury, And Enough! and Prague vs. Prague.
The prosecution speaks of them as an organized group.
The police followed her for several months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be classified as mafia?
They're such cute mobsters, not the kind we know from the KMOT.
It's more about the mafias - juniors, but the organized ones are definitely.
The only thing is that they watch each other's staffs (taxi stations).
Prague is all over the place.
I found out that, for example, the main train station does not like Paris, Paris does not like taxi drivers waiting at Karlovy L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B> (disco club)
Everyone is just guarding their own place and each group is somehow organized.
It seems to be a complex network.
However, only seven people, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate official were charged, who warned the driver of the checks.
As you say, the undesirable phenomenon did not disappear from the streets.
So what percentage of Prague taxi service fraudsters do you estimate?
It's a very small percentage.
The worst ones on the street are still around.
I'm talking about Ale<0xC5><0xA1> Ryj<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, for example.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he drives a telescopic baton in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands by Charles Bridge and drives people.
The last time I went with him, he wanted seven hundred miles from me.
The police did not arrest him for some reason.
They only picked a few people from the whole big group.
The same is true in other parts of Prague.
The prosecution of seven people thus finds it difficult to exonerate the already notorious Prague swindler, who apparently has a much larger dimension.
Of course, it's not for nothing.
It will help, but all evil will not be wiped out, that is true.
Do taxi drivers who rob foreign tourists still perform in the same places you showed in the reports, i.e. at the Charles Bridge or in Paris Street?
Yes, that's right.
In these locations, they stand every day and violate the ordinances every day.
It ignores both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
It is no longer a cat, but a complete indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
Yet some of them, even if only part of the group, will be brought to justice.
It's already a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as a compliment, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and always will be for the center of Prague to improve.
And even if I feel that I need a little bit better, I will continue to do so.
It is necessary to push on the door from the other side.
Even if the last thief stays there, we should still do something to get him out.
You can't settle for that.
But that’s not the case, there are more of them, of course.
Are you still trying to confront them in taxis?
Sometimes I do test drives and I have to say it's still bad.
Just last week, I caught a cab driver, by the way, from the same group, and he was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although he later claimed that it was 56 crowns (he used a trick with a decimal point).
He had a receipt, the cops came, and this cabbie was so cute, he was still following the cops, and he asked them when someone would finally give him the 56 crowns.
A similar case.
The taxi driver on the taximeter glued the decimal line and stole tourists for 357 crowns.
Can it be said that the audacity of fraudulent taxi drivers did not subside even after you showed the faces of those who charged senseless amounts for a short ride in your footage?
Their bravery is still incredible.
How'd it go with that cabbie with 56 crowns?
The police sent him away with the fact that they could not discuss with him on the spot because he had issued a receipt.
And that, I think, will be a problem in this court too (six taxi drivers and one ex-officio).
On one side there will be a taxi driver with his bills, on the other side of the police.
However, according to the decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate must not use secret recordings from the taxi service vehicle as evidence in court.
When I was filming parts about their scams, the taxi drivers themselves alerted me to this precedent.
I have always wanted to use images only for reporting.
Are you afraid that this fact could protect them in court?
I hope that every judge will understand that no taxi driver could drive for six or ten crowns a kilometer, because he would not use it.
You talked about a trick with a decimal point, which, especially in front of foreign clients, fraudulent taxi drivers are moving.
Is it still up-to-date, or are you afraid to continue using this trick after your reports are published?
I think we popularized this trick by broadcasting the show on the contrary.
I recently drove with a taxi driver, boasting in front of me that he is the honest taxi driver.
Then I noticed that a black card was glued to the side of the taximeter.
When I asked him what it was, he said, "You know what it is."
If the fines were not enough for the taxi driver-fraudsters, can the court with their colleagues be wary of them?
Is there anything that can stop them from cheating?
You've talked about how you think they'll always find a way to cheat.
I don't think he can stop them.
But someone can push them out of those places.
And these are the fair cab drivers who should be fighting harder to get them out of there.
From my experience, I have to say that these fair taxi drivers in Prague, fortunately, prevail.
But do they want to go against those who spoil the reputation of their services?
They have a taste, but they lack a mind.
He can't walk much and he can't say exactly what he wants.
When they staged the demonstration (because of the proposal for a nationwide restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krn<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>), it was not very clear what they really wanted.
They once said that they didn’t protest against Uber, that they just wanted the same conditions as this service, and then they claimed that they wanted more than Uber.
It turned out that they just blocked Prague and only the best possible advertising for Uber emerged from it.
How do you overall assess the Prague Magistrate’s approach to solving the problem of fare overestimation?
It can be seen that only the criminal police had to step in to solve something.
The court was short on that.
They had a mole there that was carrying out the information, which means that the taxi department was doing its job for several years completely unnecessarily.
I hope that the official will be charged with all the missed checks until the last check, so that he will realize what he has done.
I think that's the worst part.
I was even with him on one control ride, which I only found out later from their schedule.
It has been several months since the last episodes of the series were published.
What's the response?
I’m thinking mainly of foreign viewers, which is what the series is most focused on.
Whenever I have friends from abroad, I let them watch the videos.
And then when we walk through Old Town Square, they are surprised that the same people that are seen on the pictures are really standing there.
Infamous Prague celebrities.
But seriously.
I'd put a tile around them for people to look at.
Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you take a taxi when you need to?
Oh, yeah.
I drive with services where I don’t have to pay in cash, but with a card.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago where there is no possibility of fraud.
But there are also many controls that are fair.
I've only taken a taxi on the street since then.
When I got in the car, the driver said, "Well, you have the courage."
Beam in disguise for an Italian tourist.
Fraudulent practices of taxi drivers were reported in 2005.
In the same year, the former mayor Pavel Bem went for a check drive in disguise as an Italian tourist and immediately on the first attempt the driver cheated him by two hundred.
But Rube<0xC5><0xA1> had a worse experience.
Taxi drivers charged him 820 crowns for driving from Old Town to Wenceslas Square, which amounts to about 195 crowns per kilometre, according to the reportage creators.
The Prague Magistrate has set the maximum price at 28 crowns per kilometer.
In the recorded reportage there are also other surprising sums: for example, a two-kilometer road from Par<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>sk<0xC3><0xA1> street to Truhl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xA1> cost a tourist 400 crowns.
Expensive rides were also provided by taxi drivers waiting at Charles Bridge.
For a ride to the Angel, which has 2.5 kilometers, they even charge six hundred crowns.
Marble is washed mostly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer, the better.
The impurities from it go well, although sometimes the dirt has to be put down with a scalpel, it must be pushed out of the folds.
It’s not easy and it’s not fast, restorationist Vanessa Trostov<0xC3><0xA1> from Old<0xC5><0x99>ichov in H<0xC3><0xA1>j<0xC3><0xAD> brought her work closer.
Hat down in front of her: the tombstone is built with a scaffolding, after which it is necessary to climb up and down again countless times.
"The restorer should be careful, patient and undemanding to the working environment," she said.
This is by far not her first restoration work in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlantsk.
Thanks to her, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the rear of the town hall were restored, the statues of St. Mary Magdalene in Z<0xC3><0xA1>ti<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>, St. John Nepomuck<0xC3><0xBD> in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlanta, Piet in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlantsk<0xC3><0xA1> Okru<0xC5><0xBE>n<0xC3><0xAD> Street, the Marian Column in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant<0xC3><0xAD> or the Marian Column in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlanta were restored.
The restoration of the tomb of Melchior, Kry<0xC5><0xA1>tof and Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina from Redern started in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleaned from the application of dirt and crust, the loosed stone parts are secured against falling and shifting; either they will be anchored to the wall or to each other.
There is also treatment and preservation of the surface.
The inscriptions on the tomb are golden again.
"Then it will start by gold-plating the inscriptions on the marble slabs with pure spot gold," said V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Sobotov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokeswoman for the city's State Heritage Office in Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant.
There are no records from the past that the tombstone would have gone through any repairs.
At a closer look, they will take in the holes drilled in the marble columns.
They are hundreds of years old and are the remains after the decoration of the tomb.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the invasion of the Swedes during the Thirty Years' War, everything disappeared.
Literally, the tombstone was cut, Sobotov<0xC3><0xA1> noted.
In the Church of the Finding of the Holy Cross there are restorers with a slight exaggeration as at home.
After the flood of 2010, it was necessary to put in order the tombs that were under water, the baptistery was restored, wall paintings in the tomb and now the tomb.
"We would like to go to the stained-glass windows in the future as well," Sobotov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The church is otherwise in very good condition, every year we put money into maintenance and repair.
Restoration work on the restoration of the Redernov tomb will total to 128,000 crowns.
They will be paid from subsidies, the city will not invest any money in this part of the renovation.
One hundred thousand crowns will go from winning in the regional round of the Historic City of 2015, the remaining 28 thousand crowns is the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, said Mayor of Fr<0xC3><0xBD>dlant Dan Ramzer.
The delegation decided to release the prize for the restoration of the tomb.
Experts’ views on future developments in selected foreign markets are monitored through indexes and comparisons with the Czech capital market (PX) in a period of one and a half months.
The markets are dominated by low volatility and growth.
Who would have thought that at the beginning of the year?
The S&P500 index, which went through a 12 percent correction in February, is now at a new all-time high and has posted 7 percent since the start of the year.
This reaffirms the iron rule that traders should never, in the long run, go against the interests of central banks, which have always achieved theirs in the end.
In a situation where U.S. stocks are at historic highs, volatility is again disappearing, which is currently the lowest since 2014, when markets grew satisfactorily and fearlessly thanks to the quantitative easing of the U.S. central bank and when, as today, the volatility index (VIX) remained stable below the 12 percent mark.
And I don't want to.
Although the Fed is preparing the markets for a gradual increase in interest rates, quantitative easing in Europe and Japan is in full swing, and last week the Bank of England also joined the effort, which will buy bonds worth <0xC2><0xA3>70 billion over the next six months.
The new wave of quantitative easing is therefore pushing already low returns even lower and contributing to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear from the future.
How long will this condition last?
This is, of course, a million-dollar question.
But at the moment there are no risks for surveillance, the world economy is experiencing almost constant growth without major fluctuations, the situation on the commodity market and in China is stabilizing and Brexit is basically no longer a topic, so we shouldn’t be too surprised if in a similarly calm regime, the US would survive.
It's a pity that Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I am very pleased that my friend Michel Barnier has accepted this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job, said the head of the European Commission, Juncker, when the French politician (really experienced, because he was shot by so many different supranational political functions, that a better example of the so-called European elite would be difficult to look for from the European Commission) was appointed by the European Commission chief.
Juncker’s choice has blurred the signs of hope that it is in the EU’s serious interest to seek a form of future friendly co-existence with Britain.
However, most of the British media adopted the name Barnier as the Juncker War Act.
Barnier is a European federalist.
They hate the UK.
As European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014), he was responsible for the reform of European banking law.
He understood it as only he could understand it: a staunch enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of the free market and the model of capitalism.
A proponent of multilateral regulation has co-authored the concept of a so-called banking union, and regrets everything that comes from the City of London financial centre, has advocated legislation overly harsh regulation of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in dispute with London, will be a tough, unbreakable and apparently ruthless negotiator.
I don't think that's good news.
In this context, how not to remember the peaceful and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which the balance, overview and empathy of Prime Minister V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus contributed so much.
Even today, Czechs and Slovaks can be close friends and allies.
It is a pity that Juncker did not learn from V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus - at least in this one.
It would be for the good of all!
The earthquake around Putin?
The Kremlin's ruler has released his close friend Ivan.
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday released Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office.
Anton Vajno will take his place.
It was reported by the Russian media with reference to the announcement of the press service of the Kremlin.
Putin has indicated that he will release Ivanov at his own request.
At a meeting broadcast by Rossia 24 television, the president said he was starting to respond to Ivanov's wish when he took office that he wanted to be the head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
At the same time, he announced that Ivanov would be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report of the exchange at the head of the presidential administration, which will now be led by Ivanov's current deputy Vaino, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is considered one of Putin’s closest associates.
This former KGB officer, for example, served as Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister in the past.
He is also leaving the chair of the President’s Security Council.
Ivanov, meeting with Putin, said that the length of stay at the head of the administration of the head of state is actually a record.
He lived in it for four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in the 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already been replaced in this function.
Kvitov<0xC3><0xA1> and Debl<0xC3><0xAD>stkov<0xC3><0xA1> will not play in the finals.
So far, not one of Friday’s tennis matches has been able to turn into a final.
Petra Kvitov<0xC3><0xA1> lost her first fight to Monica Puig, who succumbed to the Puerto Rican surprise after sets of 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
Kvitova was followed after a while by Czech deblists <0xC5><0xA0>af<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>iv<0xC3><0xA1> and Str<0xC3><0xBD>cov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In the first set, the Williams sisters' victors won, but lost two setballs and the Russians eventually used the set in a shortened game.
They lost the second set 4-6.
Half of the success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by the Czech rowing: skier Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Synek won his semi-finals with an overview, when he defeated the second Damir Martin from Croatia even despite the final vote by almost a second.
Today good, the conditions were great, the wind calmed down.
I tried to save as much as possible, said the son.
It was his opponents, unlike him, who had to fight for progress.
So it took them some strength, it could be easier tomorrow.
But I'm not saying it's going to be easy, it's just playing me cards, said Prague rower Dukla.
Mirka Topinkov<0xC3><0xA1>-Knapkov<0xC3><0xA1> did not walk in the footsteps of Snyk.
The thirty-five-year-old rower occupied the fourth position in today's semifinals in her ride and on Saturday she is waiting for a start in the B final and a fight for 7th to 12th place.
London's gold won't do that.
For the first time, I didn’t make it to the Olympics.
I’m a bit sorry, but on the other hand I drove a quality race and put everything I could into it.
The opponents were simply better, Topinkov<0xC3><0xA1> Knapkov<0xC3><0xA1> leaned in front of them.
She fought to the end and believed she would get into the top six in her fourth game.
She gave up the fight just before the goal.
I knew the girls were well-balanced, that anyone could step out of this field.
I was surprised by the Chinese that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could make it to the final through Raku<0xC5><0xA1>anka.
Unfortunately, today was a life race, she told the 2011 World Championships.
Far behind the final gates in Rio was a young shooter Filip Nepeichal, who for the second time failed to break through from the qualification, this time a minor in a lie.
Nepeichal occupied the 33rd place.
The qualification was the best for the Russians.
Sergey Kamensky scored 629 points from the first half, Kirill Grigoryan (628.9) from the second.
Nepeichal's shot was 620.5 points.
For the first time, athletes spoke in the program in Rio, including Czech seven-year-old Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Cachov<0xC3><0xA1> and Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klu<0xC4><0x8D>inov<0xC3><0xA1>.
After the second discipline of the Olympic competition, the Czech record holder Eli<0xC5><0xA1>ka Klu<0xC4><0x8D>inov<0xC3><0xA1> is in 11th place.
It is led by British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters, as well as the second Belgian Nafissata Thiam.
Both took care of the historically best high-altitude performance within the seven-fight.
They tried to jump another 201 centimeters, but failed.
German, Russian, who's worse?
If we look away from the absurdity of the following question: German society has undergone a deep self-reflection, whereas Russian has not.
Dictators emerged in both great Eurasian nations in the 20th century, and regimes that were inhuman, brutal and terrible came to power.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of communism listed in the Black Book of Communism, whether it be daily individual repression, targeted famines, incompetent warfare, or inhuman experiments.
The Nazis inhumanly exterminated about 6 million Jews, and the total casualties of World War II are estimated at 60 million.
In the occupied or abandoned territories, the Germans and the Soviets committed atrocities.
In Germany and in the USSR, not only a few individuals were guilty, but a large part of the nation participated in these crimes, whether actively, passively or only by cowardice or by sticking its head in the sand.
It is not only the specifics of these nations, we Czechs are equally guilty.
In Germany, the immediate end of the war came denazification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
As the children grew up, they began to ask, “Dad, Grandpa, why did you participate in such atrocities?”
How could you!
This has brought real reflection and healing to the society.
Until recently, German elites have been concerned mainly with the prosperity of the country, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of their citizens.
Now they have other (often na<0xC3><0xAF>vely idealistic) goals, but they certainly don’t want to re-attach Alsace-Lorraine or someone – to retaliate – to attack militarily – perhaps everyone recognizes that.
After the defeat of the Cold War in Russia, there was no great reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was definitely closed at the turn of the millennium, when the former KGB officer (sic!) Vladimir Putin came to power.
Often the criminal past is celebrated in Russia today.
The policy of Putin's Russia is revenge, conquest of lost territories, humiliation of the West.
The health, prosperity, and future of one’s own people is of no value to the believer.
Fight your way, and strangers will fear you.
I still believe that it is only through those decades of despotic rule that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior - destined for Asian (self) tyranny.
Who benefits from the rise in tensions around Crimea?
The Ukrainian Army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has worsened.
To whom does the rise in tension benefit?
After a long period of relative calm, relations between Ukraine and Russia deteriorated again.
The pretext of the Ukrainian side became the Crimea peninsula, which was annexed to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
Of course, the reports from both sides contradict each other and it is difficult to independently verify them, and so we have the opportunity only to think about the old known question to whom it benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which, of course, Ukraine rejects and accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
Information about the arrest of members of Ukrainian special forces in the territory of Russia has already come from the pilot's case Savchenko's known answer that they were allegedly abducted in the territory of Russia.
If we were to adopt the Ukrainian version, what would be the benefit to Russia of the worsening situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: in nothing.
The escalation of tensions around Crimea can only hurt Russia, mainly from the West in the form of further strengthening of sanctions and strengthening of the anti-Russian campaign.
In the last year, in the background of the immigration crisis in Europe, there has been a retreat of attention from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already completely lost credit in front of its residents, with the current support of President Poroshenko hovering around 15%.
Ukraine’s economy would have gone bankrupt long ago if it had not been for generous financial injections by the EU and, above all, the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs to draw attention to its country once again, in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and try to improve its reputation in front of voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the force once again want to show themselves as strong men who are not afraid to stand up to the great Russia.
It remains to be hoped that all those who are trying to launch an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their enormous responsibility for the lives not only of the soldiers, but of all ordinary people on both sides of the enemy and stop their hostile actions in time.
Bulgaria shows inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest value in several years (since June 2012) and the first non-zero value since October last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the CPI, for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12-month period (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0.8%.
The consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101.0%, thus the monthly inflation was 1.0%.
The rate of inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and the annual rate of inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month, there was an increase in the travel of these groups of consumer goods in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
There was a decrease in prices for clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household equipment and routine maintenance (0.5%), and health (0.1%).
Prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education remained at the same level as last month.
The U.S. intelligence agency said it had been monitoring Russian hacking attacks for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced it was attacking the servers of the Democratic Party headquarters.
However, there is no official mention of Russia’s involvement in the attack.
Moscow denied any involvement in the attack.
The report of the alleged Russian attack was top secret because it would reveal that US intelligence agencies are monitoring and detecting the hacker attack and could also be the way they do it and what resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence services were reportedly involved in the attack.
The New Cybersecurity Advisory Board
The Russian trace tracking material was coded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters reported.
Only a small group of eight leading members of Congress, called the Gang of Eight in the United States, were informed of the public officials.
It consists of both House Chiefs Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, both House Speakers Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, and four members of the House Defense and Security Committees.
Democratic Party chief executive Donna Brazile announced Thursday that she is creating a cyber security advisory board to "prevent future attacks and ensure the top-notch protection of Democratic Party servers."
There was a dangerous parasite in the smoked salmon of Albert.
The chain apologized.
Based on the incentive of the consumer for health problems after consumption of food Salmon wild smoked - pieces 100 g, date of consumption 22.11.2016, Prague hygiene checked in Albert stores on Wenceslas Square and Na Mostk.
The inspection found that the batch L23012562/T4 with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, which the customer pointed out, is no longer available, and therefore the product of the same batch with the date of consumption 11.12.2016 was removed.
The presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex has been confirmed by laboratory testing.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of marine mammals.
This is dangerous for humans - larvae in the body cavity or muscle of fish are a strong allergen and human-sucked live larvae can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs, Stich said.
We sincerely apologize to our customers for any problems with this branded product.
We immediately withdrew the mentioned batch from the sale and for preventive reasons we also downloaded all other batches of this item.
There was a mistake on the part of the supplier we are dealing with, and at the same time we had this product tested by ourselves, said Alberta Barbora Vanko, a spokesperson for Novonik.
If the customer has purchased this product, he can return it in any of the chain stores and get the money back.
The larvae will destroy the frost and sufficient heat treatment
The seller was Nekton - Vr<0xC5><0x88>ata.
The Prague and Central Czech veterinary administration was informed about the occurrence of a dangerous product to the hygienist.
According to the server bezbecnostpotravin.cz, after ingestion of a parasite, people can get anisakiosis, which is manifested by severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can go undetected, the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said.
Symptoms occur an hour to two weeks after ingestion of insufficiently heat-treated infected fish.
After three weeks from the onset of the disease, the larvae usually spontaneously leave the digestive tract.
Both adult worms and larvae are sensitive to higher and lower temperatures, so they are killed either with sufficient heat treatment of the fish meat or with its freezing.
Veterinarians have now checked the salmon at the recipient of the imported goods in the Central Bohemian Region.
Three of the five samples tested had a parasite in them.
The shipment of 1700 products arrived in the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Shipped, in the vast majority to the Ahold chain, was to date 919 packages.
At the moment, unsold stocks of the product are being downloaded from the stores, said SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples prohibited sending other products from the warehouse.
Seventeen-year-old Briton wanted to flee Rakka, apparently killed by a Russian attack.
After initial enthusiasm and a quick marriage to a jihadist who was soon killed, a sobering came.
The expected paradise of the caliphate for the British girls turned into hell on earth, from which there was no escape.
According to relatives, the girl was in contact with her sister Halima.
She called him repeatedly and told him she wanted to go home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They are ordered to shoot without intent, the Telegraph quoted a family lawyer for the deceased girl Tasnim Akunjee as saying.
The last traces led to Rakka, from where the girl spoke for the last time.
Then came the news of her death, which cannot be verified.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
They discussed how they could get out of Raqqa and cross the Turkish border.
There they hoped to meet with the former student again.
But Kadiza was likely killed before she could escape because the house she was staying in was likened to a ground attack in May, Britain’s ITV News reported.
The TV added that the bomb was apparently dropped by a Russian plane that attacked an ISIS stronghold in Syria.
You would take blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week when (Kadiza) was thinking about escaping from the territory of the Islamic State, a woman was caught trying to escape and, according to available information, was publicly killed.
“I think [Kadiza] took it as a warning and decided not to risk it,” Akunjee told the BBC.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana, along with 15-year-old school friends Shamima Begum and Amira Abas, set out on a journey on February 17 last year.
All they said at home was that they were going out.
However, they headed for Gatwick Airport and from there via Turkey into IS-controlled territory.
The family of the girl, according to the lawyer, did everything in their power to get Kadiza back.
You would take the blue from the sky just to get your child out of a dangerous area and this family did everything they could to get their daughter home.
But this was not possible without risking being caught on their own, the lawyer added.
The only positive is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a deterrent for other girls or even boys who are fooled by Islamist propaganda.
"There are many cases where people went there, realized how things are there, understood how far it differs from the promises of Islamic State propaganda, and wanted to come back," Akunjee said.
The fate of Kadyzia's classmates is not known.
But since they have also been silenced, their families must accept that they are most likely dead.
To jail for money.
In Scotland, you can go behind bars without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the village of Inveraray was the regional centre and seat of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the middle of the 18th century, courts have been held at the town hall and the basement under the hall has served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the convicts lived were sad, and many prisoners tried to escape.
A lot of them have been successful.
Therefore, the city officials decided to move the premises of the prison to a new location.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more welcoming to the prisoners, it had heating and gas lighting.
In any case, it was not in operation for a long time, it was closed for economic reasons already at the end of August 1889, since smaller corrective devices were expensive to operate and did not pay much.
The stories of the convicts and the hunt for ghosts.
For the public, the prison opened a century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new one to see for themselves how different conditions prevailed in them.
The guides in the period costumes further enhance the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room where visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to criminals, whether it was breaking fingers or burning marks on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be locked up in one of the customs, mostly because of the photograph on the memorial, or to indicate the feeling that prisoners experience behind bars.
In addition, Inveraray Prison is one of the most famous Scottish prisons, where it is said to be haunted.
Several groups of hunters of paranormal activities have already gone there, and even today the museum allows people to come and hunt ghosts.
Such a night, of course, will cost 300 pounds, which is approximately 9500 crowns.
In addition to this popular tourist attraction, the village also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
"Animal" effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is racially insensitive.
Snapchat’s app every day allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with identity in ways that border on absurdity.
You can make yourself a pineapple, a dog or a figure that looks like it came out of Roy Lichtenstein’s picture.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfies every day.
Any errors will be posted immediately.
Snapchat filters have in the past earned criticism with accusations that the app promotes blackfacing or that it promotes white skin tones as an ideal of beauty.
So when it offered users this week a filter that allowed them to have slanted eyes, crooked teeth, and puffy faces, some critics called it the racist caricature of Asians – “yellowface.”
And they asked if these repeated controversial questions did not point to a larger problem in society – the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the news and outrage quickly spread, and Snapchat announced the next day that it had canceled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as a show of accounts to anime characters, not as a caricature of Asians.
But to observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded them of painful stereotypes in action.
The others without packaging compared to the anime refused.
Grace Sparapani, an American art student from Korea whose tweet about the photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was “at least harmful and embarrassing.”
She added that “it is difficult to argue against comparing the obvious Asian caricature and filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about a yellow face (yellowface), but that a yellow face is drawn to a contemptuous extreme.
Snapchat isn’t the only company that has crossed these cultural boundaries.
American culture seems to have an endless battle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting rooms to Holywood and the facilities we all carry in our hands.
And the sheer number of young people on Snapchat — who are more racially diverse than their older partners — may mean even more sensitivity can be expected.
“When a Snapchat filter creates an image that’s offensive to a user,” Katie Zhu, 25, said in an interview Thursday, “it’s very hard to get around these things today without noticing how it used to be.”
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer who works for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and in a phone interview, she said she is convinced that racially motivated issues reflect the lack of diversity in hiring employees on Snapchat.
Katie Zhu criticized the company’s predominantly white, all-male leadership and ended the article with a hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
"It's either that they don't have any diversity between employees and people of color at the time they decide these things," said Zhu, who is of Chinese-American origin, "or that's where people of color work, but not in positions to feel safe or comfortable to talk about."
Other observers share her view – a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish figures relating to the diversity of its employees, provided that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to talk about the racial background of its employees, but, according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a recruiter who should focus on underrepresented populations and internal inclusion management.
Zhu adds, “I’m curious if they really need more users like that who can say it’s not okay,” with their account being canceled.
Army officers distort intelligence information about IS, says parliamentary committee
The parliamentary committee said in a report released on Thursday that officers from the U.S. Central Command were changing intelligence reports to paint a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than what they provided from the country.
According to the preliminary report of the working group of the Republican Chairman of the Committee on Armed Forces, the Committee on Intelligence and the Subcommittee on Defense, there was a "widespread dissatisfaction" among analysts of the Central Intelligence Agency, according to which their superiors changed their assessment.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, overseeing U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The press release to the report states: “The intelligence exits approved by senior Centcom officers usually offered a more positive picture of U.S. counterterrorism efforts than were confirmed by the facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than analyses obtained from other sources.”
“What happened at Centcom is unacceptable — our fighters are harmed when a flawed analysis is presented to senior policymakers,” said Ken Calvert, a congressman and Republican from California.
The failure of Centcom leadership reaches to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report details the central staff’s ongoing problems in describing and analyzing U.S. efforts in training Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While no conclusive evidence is offered that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be amended, the report states that analysts had the impression that they were under pressure from Centcom leaders to present a more optimistic view of the dangers posed by the Islamic State.
“In the first half of 2015, many of the press reports from the headquarters, statements and statements from Congress were significantly more positive than what the events actually were,” the report said.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack to take over Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
“This is quite clear after months of investigation,” said Rep. Mike Pompeo, a Republican Party representative from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, top-ranking intelligence officers of the US Central Staff manipulated the staff’s intelligence outputs in order to downplay the danger of IS in Iraq.
The Republicans assembled a working group after learning of analysts’ concerns that intelligence information relating to the Islamic State is being manipulated.
After the report published on Thursday, further investigation must be followed by a more detailed investigation.
In Centcom’s intelligence services, further investigations are underway, led by the Department of Defense’s inspector general.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the conclusions of a working group of Republicans.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom has created a very tight process for compiling an evaluation of information on ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said Adam B. Schiff, chairman of the committee and deputy to the Democrats.
According to Adam Schiff, this process “led to distort the outputs of intelligence services,” damaged morale among analysts, and “insufficiently took into account dissenting views.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they have found no evidence that the White House would try to pressure analysts at Centcom to adjust their conclusions to “preliminary or political situation.”
Preliminary results of the parliamentary inquiry were published in the Daily Beast on Tuesday.
Last August, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation by the Pentagon’s inspector general, which was launched following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the parliamentary report because the Inspector General’s investigation is still ongoing.
But he said "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these critical national security issues."
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing in Iraq and Syria is successful (a ruling that now declares a growing number of defense officials).
However, last year’s charges raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the central staff to honestly assess military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis locations.
Critics of the report on the Islamic State have been reflecting conflicts for more than a decade, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper stating that President George W. Bush’s administration — despite objections from many analysts — was defending a small unit in Iraq and the country’s capital.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting the intelligence services of the Islamic State.
Last year, authorities announced that Hooker’s team had concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, the airstrikes against Islamic State’s refineries had not significantly weakened the group’s financial resources, as the group had built a temporary refinery for the oil and gas industry.
The Times reported in September that the findings had not been handed over outside the central headquarters.
The commander of Centcom, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized last year after many lawmakers found the Senate testimony too positive an assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced at Centcom by General Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. won ground hockey in the fourth game in a row, so today will be the decisive game in the team of Great Britain
Katie Bam scored three goals in a 6-1 win against Japan, and the day after that, she scored the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team, in which the U.S. defeated India 3-0 on Thursday.
Five goals in two games is a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she wasn’t sure if she’d ever done something like that.
"I have no idea," she said.
I'm not one of those people who writes down their goals.
But he knows this: The Americans lead the Olympic tournament to a 4-0 draw and share the first place in the group with the United Kingdom, which remained undefeated on Thursday after Japan's 2-0 defeat.
The United Kingdom and the United States will face each other on Saturday in the final match of the first round.
Both teams qualified for the quarter-finals and the match will decide who of the six teams will finish in first place and who will finish in second place.
The team from the first place will avoid the strong Danes who are at the head of the second group a little longer.
Whatever the end of Saturday's game, the Americans here have caused a stir with their surprising drive, four years after they finished between the 12 teams at the games in London.
Bam was on that team, too.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took up field hockey for the first time when she was 3 years old (her older twin sisters played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player ever.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she didn't make it to the finals.
Then came 2012, when neither she nor the members of her team had much success.
The next year, Englishman Craig Parnham was named coach, and things started to change.
"Cultural change, mental change, physical change," Bam said.
In London, we didn’t have the pace of work that we have today.
We've made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bamov<0xC3><0xA1> started in the first half by shooting the gate known from close range.
India entered the match without a win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and held the score 1-0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam took advantage of the opportunities.
She escaped on the left side of the playing field, then snickered to the center and shot the ball into the goal to get the Americans into the lead 2:0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in the quarter-finals.
The elimination of American goalie Jackie Briggs, who helped one goal in each of the three wins, was the first in the tournament.
He's in great shape.
Same as Bam.
"We're in a good place now," Parnham said, "but how good it is will depend on the outcome of Saturday's game."
Zen trampolines in the middle of the Olympic rage
It doesn't matter where you are, it doesn't matter what time it is - it's the Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro it is to feel a persistent, indescribable and engaged alternation of competitiveness and effort.
It's like the Olympic torch itself would be a hot relay pin, which is passed from the mirror to the swimmer, the gymnast and the triathlete.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation at the coffee shop front without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the hostility between Michael Phelps and Chad le Close.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming darling of women with dimples in her cheeks, is at the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names ring in the households in prime time between the ad and the sponsor spots, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even a swordsman.
But Dooley, 28, of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for Olympic gold in trampoline jumps.
The Olympic flame does not shine in all competitions the same way.
Far from the center, a little in the shade are sports that are not generally recognized: shooting from air guns, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and will probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favorite, let me point out the inconspicuous charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumps have been an Olympic sport since 2000, when they were first introduced at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention the sport remains almost unnoticed – many people I have questioned didn’t even know it was an Olympic sport.
It could be regional indifference.
The U.S. never won a medal in trampoline jumps, and until 2012 none of the athletes made it to the finals.
Prices in the men's category are usually split between China and Russia and in the women's category between China and Canada.
This year, the gold medals from London will be embraced by Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
However, trampoline jumps have yet another misfortune, partly because the uninitiated ear will seem more suited to a clown university than to an Olympics.
I must admit that I am not an expert, but only an enthusiast watching from the ground.
It has comic potential – comical vibrations of infinite reflection – but also the dexterity of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it combines.
The word "trampoline" is derived from the Spanish "el trampoline", which means "skipboard."
Aspiring champions jump on a huge trampoline that shoots them up to a height of almost 10 meters and show sets of several elements (salt, propellers and combinations) before finally landing on their feet again.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated by design, difficulty and "time in the air".
In Rio will compete thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic track is forward.
Fighters for the gold medal must go further, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes there and back, up and down.
He is trying to catch up not only with the finish line or the starting wall, but also with another imaginary line: a world or an Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a little fanatical – and enough to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it's kind of exhausting at the same time you're watching the Olympics.
Jumping on the trampoline in this regard brings relief.
The athlete's track on the trampoline is up.
The point is not to move forward.
He or she is reflected as if they were in a state of no gravity like astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again effortlessly up.
Without competition and, of course, even difficulty, it is not possible, but for the duration of the composition, there is no fierce struggle to achieve the goal, no measurement of distance, but only perfect, fine-tuning of time and gravity.
This is the closest we get to the Olympics and Zen.
Women's qualification and finals are held on Friday afternoon, at 1 p.m. Eastern time, and men's competition on Saturday at the same time.
NBC will broadcast the final within the afternoon block, which starts after both days at 2 p.m.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, they promise quiet, pleasant moments that you will probably overlook through other fights.
And if the only way to get attention is for male athletes to be the subject of much-loved looks and materialization — as U.S. gymnasts recently suggested, according to the Wall Street Journal — then Logan Dooley is just waiting for his new fans to catch his breath.
The “Protestant Generation” in Ethiopia, a longtime US ally
Violent Protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses say many protesters were shot dead during clashes with police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
In the past decade it has been one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a fast-growing economy.
In recent months, however, the country has been gripped by anti-government unrest, which is spreading to more and more areas.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding fundamental political change.
According to human rights organizations, the government’s response was merciless.
Witnesses say the police shot and killed a crowd of unarmed protesters.
On the rolling videos of the protests, probably from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, members of the security forces are captured beating young people with sticks after they were forced to stand at the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and to take a step forward will be even harder,” said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group research group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to eliminate the danger of a terrorist attack in the region, particularly in Somalia, and few, if any, African countries are getting such assistance from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia has been developing at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly – there is even a new suburban train in the capital, Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia can hardly be described as a model of democracy - an organization fighting for human rights constantly talking about government repressions - the opposition in the country has been suppressed, the dissidents effectively silenced.
Many of them were deported, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the desert.
But that can change.
“When people suffocate and they have no choice but to protest, there will be a breakthrough,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the University of Central Ethiopia.
He's protesting all the youth.
He's been protesting for generations.
There are many complaints, ranging from land disputes to the absolute control of the ruling coalition.
After last year’s election, which was widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies won the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, the pressure on the border with Eritrea is increasing. The conflict along this inaccurate, disputed border in June has claimed hundreds of lives.
Anylitists fear that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed in recent years, such as the Oromic Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to exploit the confusion and re-arm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why now, after years of greasing under the surface, these bitter feelings have flared up again.
The first one is seemingly harmless: smart phones.
Many Ethiopians have been able to communicate via social networks until the last few years, when cheaper smartphones became commonly available and the provision of internet services improved.
And even if the government bans access to Facebook or Twitter, as is usually the case especially during protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxy, which hides the location of these people.
Several young Ethiopians spoke about how they had gathered for the protests.
There is also greater solidarity between the Oromia and Amhara, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oroms and Amhars are not natural allies.
For many centuries, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian highlands of Ethiopia, excelled in politics and trade and used the Oromia, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that's also changing.
"We are on the way to unified leadership," said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of the Oromia.
The largest protests took place in the areas inhabited by Amhara and Oroma.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigrayan ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls the army, intelligence, trade, and politics.
The third cause of concern is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Zenawi, the former leader of the insurgents, was the Ethiopian prime minister for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he succumbed to an unspecified illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could see around the corner.
Analysts say he was particularly masterful at revealing the initial signals of discontent and using envoys to process and get opponents on his side.
“The current regime lacks basic knowledge,” said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative obscurity in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say he has no confidence in the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many are concerned that the result will be further bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts described as an election that the government squandered and then stole.
This was followed by a harsh crackdown during which many protesters were killed - though less than in recent months - and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia’s leaders for visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in combating poverty.
However, it is quite clear that the gradual increase in disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop this.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation taking place.
Last month, protesters in the Amharic city of Gondar attacked businesses owned by the Tigers, and anger against the Tigers on social media is becoming more common.
Analysts say the protests are putting the U.S. and other Western allies in a dire situation.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently said the base was closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, at the same time it does not want its ally to disintegrate in such a volatile area.
"That," said Abdi, "is the very sharp edge of the blade."
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and funding ISIS as “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump tried to downplay the latest controversy flooding his campaign on Friday, saying he didn’t mean it seriously when he insisted several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were “founders” of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican candidate’s ability to speak clearly to the American public.
He also puts his supporters in an uncomfortable situation, who have been hard at work defending him in turbulent times, and must explain that he may not have taken his remarks seriously.
After this proposal at a meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday, insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to say that the president and H. Clinton created ISIS.
However, in a tweet on Friday morning, Trump said he was only sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of the old man’s claim just one day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften the remark by reminding him that Obama was seeking to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate for president did not respond.
The latest storm comes at a time when Trump has tried to focus his campaign’s attention on the economy, while his preferences in pre-election polls are declining.
Trump and Clinton took part in a duel on economic issues in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to the topic.
He again warned on Twitter that Clinton’s proposals were linked to a tax hike, and said her speech was somewhat boring.
Trump has used sarcasm defenses before.
At the end of July, when he picked up a wave of criticism, when he came forward with the suggestion that the Russians should break into Clinton emails, he would later explain his remark in words: “Of course I’m sarcastic.”
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and moderate them as needed.
“I think it’s his way of testing the extent to which some of the messages have a response from his supporters to find out how they’re reacting, and according to the response then in one way or another he “submitted an explanation,” said Ruth Sherman, a communications specialist who followed the language used by both candidates.
But I also think that he is receptive in his statements and knows that they are vague enough to be explained differently.
As poll results continue to decline in his favor, Trump has chosen an even more sloppy tone in recent days, instead of settling matters for the general electorate.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll, which was published Friday, showed that Tump is a long way behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close to her in Florida.
Trump tries to avoid apologizing for the provocative statements he makes, but often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But along with Trump’s increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have put his loyal supporters in an awkward position, who must publicly stand behind him, no matter how provocative his remarks may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who is one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate extensively in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
“I think what he’s saying is legitimate political commentary,” Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, which he mistakenly called a rookie, and it happened because he withdrew his troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Clinton served as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to flourish and failed to aggressively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Ahead of Friday’s gatherings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to fire on the media on Twitter for relaying his every word and engaging in it.
He laughed at the “poor, pathetic” television students who were trying to understand him and said, “They can’t do it!”
Several Democrats sneered at Trump, saying it was just another piece of evidence that he was ineligible for the presidency.
The cafe has been pushed out of the market price. It is now returning to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a dirty place in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee had been served for 15 years.
Naturally, she was pushed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - a store Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells cupcake-shaped soaps.
Locals mourned it as the last loss of a growing city.
New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea hotel is looted, and Verb is now a soap shop.
But if New York is a change, then it is also a rediscovery.
The resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new Verb has wifi and accepts payment cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, modest atmosphere.
Coffee is still good, too.
The manager of the new Verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the original coffee shop, who is also the owner and CEO of the new location.
He started at Verb in 2001 and stayed until the end.
When one of the customers offered to pay for the move to a new location, he said he would do so with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bakery supplier and bought the same espresso machine model.
He even re-used the illumination from the Old Testament.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
On offer are sandwiches with ham, egg and cheese and toppings, such as capers and fried onion.
You will also find dishes with brown rice.
The café no longer serves beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a steady influx of native gastritis.
“Many of the original customers also had to move out of Williamsburg because of the prices,” he said.
Last Sunday, there was one such customer, Rebecca Oliveira.
Mrs. Oliveira (34) lived in Williamsburg and went to Verb Cafe frequently.
It was even after the cafe had moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, she had stopped drinking coffee altogether for a while.
"I found that what I like is coffee and culture in Verba," she said.
Now he drinks coffee again, but that day instead of her usual iced coffee, she gave herself a mixed chai, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-time customer, has been loyal to Verb since 2003.
He goes to work and always orders the same thing.
"At quarter past eight, I come here every day, like a watch, and they're already preparing my goose with everything and butter for me," he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add a new ingredient to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal still orders what he usually does, but sometimes he puts bacon, eggs and ham on his goose.
Rodriguez said he's not sorry the soap business took his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make a special soap for Verb and use filtered coffee from the cafe as an ingredient.
"I think we could still use it," Rodriguez said.
The traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint also welcomed the café well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon exhibit it to make his new neighbors feel at home.
The new location has other advantages.
The local fruit juice producer wants to bottle up and sell filtered coffee.
It is possible to expand the café into a neighbouring building.
A lot of customers just need to get their old favorite back.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer, and when the coffee shop closed, it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says when the coffee shop reopens, it's like coming home for coffee.
"I missed the smell," he said.
Depressive food from the time of crisis - in "Square Meal"
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat in the Oval Office and had lunch.
President Roosevelt’s loafer enjoyed selected dishes from 5th Avenue, such as goose-pox p<0xC3><0xA2>té and the Maryland turtle soup.
His menu for this day, however, was more modest: eggs in the devil's way in tomato sauce, potato puree and as a dessert plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who suffered," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to the Americans how to eat.”
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are engaged in gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe’s last book, “Chop Suey,” was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane, in her book, “97 Orchard,” tells the life story of a mansion on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new collaborative work, “A Square Meal,” published by Harper on Tuesday, is a history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They themselves showed culinary solidarity and met with a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg’s sandwich shop, a small strict buffet in the Flatiron district, which has been in operation since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered cream cheese and a sandwich with chopped olives, Andrew (57) had turkey, potato porridge and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a meatball, which the pair said was a good fit for a food conversation during the crisis.
"Carbanates were very popular," said Ms. Ziegelman.
He sold beetroot, liver and bean carbanate.
They were made from that mixture and other cheap food that set the ingredients.
Think about the amount of beets you would need to eat for dinner.
Andrew Coe grinned.
"They would lie in your stomach like lead," he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet of meals that you eat.
Teams of women cooked for farm workers and a freshly baked cake was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "A Square Meal" looks at how the nation coped with the fact that it was not suddenly a land of abundance.
"It was a time when food became a central, feared point for the American people," Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
A new budget diet was equally feared: Mysterious foods, such as carbanates and castors, spread as “an amazing way to use leftovers,” Ziegelman noted, as cooks could hide unsightly ingredients under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat – after years of being the focal point of American food – has become a sparingly allocated luxury.
Strange mixtures, which were supposed to serve as a caloric and nutritional supplement, had a preference over taste or even common sense when cooking.
While researching for a book containing recipes, Ms. Ziegelman prepared a time-honoured meal of baked onion stuffed with pea butter.
"It wasn't a favorite addition to the dinner table," Andrew Coe said.
Jane Ziegelman said, “It was surreal.”
Burdock butter with roasted onion does not go together.
It was typical for a lot of homemade recipes.
As never before and never since, domestic economists—including Louise Stanley, the head of the Federal Office of the Home Economy from 1923 to 1943—managed the country’s eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, urged women to take over the burdens of the budget, and slicks, such as cream spaghetti with carrots, turned into tasty meals.
The book "A Square Meal" is a celebration of historical delicacies.
First of all, desserts were created in the government’s response to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s “I’ll have a cake” pose.
While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his childhood, he dined as the chosen millionaire he became.
"He liked to eat continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce," said Andrew Coe.
He was eating in an almost gilded room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was incredibly old-fashioned.
President Roosevelt would probably have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn’t taken him as an example in her own stomach.
As the book tells us, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housewife who was not interested in taste at all. This led to the White House “not only serving almost the most flamboyant food in all of Washington, but also in the most unsatisfied way prepared.”
A number of eating habits from the time of the crisis faded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The link remained in our ongoing study of calories and nutritional values, says Ms. Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to cooking.
The couple says that while writing the book, they better understood Ms. Ziegelman’s mother’s eating habits — perhaps why she couldn’t throw out the food.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Andrew Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, “The people in it were bad.”
There was an accident with the wreaths.
When Eisenberg had clean tables, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert they had prepared at home: the plum dessert President Roosevelt had eaten for lunch.
"It's called plum cream," Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone inadvertently smashed a spoon into a dense brown mass.
Surprisingly, it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then one more time.
And as the right owner he said to his wife, "It would be a little bit of chopped up hairs."

Gilead is entitled to reimbursement of the cost of legal representation in the case of a patent against a type C jaundice against Merck
A district court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement of fees for lawyers who have filed for it in the case of a patent against a type C jaundice against the drug manufacturer of Merck & Co.
In June, a ruling was overturned that Gilead was to pay $200 million in damages for violating Merck's two patents in connection with Gilead's highly successful drugs, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the federal judge found repeatedly illegal conduct on the part of Merck's other non-lawyers.
Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman said in a filing Thursday that Gilead is entitled to a waiver of fees incurred in connection with representation in the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the next-generation drug market against type C jaundice, which can cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed to be the owners of basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, an active ingredient of Gilead’s drugs.
US-backed military forces claim they have gained full control of the city of Manbij
U.S.-backed military forces gained full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last Islamic State fighters fled the city, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now combing through the city after the rest of the group of radicals who were hiding in the city have left.
The units liberated more than 2,000 civilians held by the radicals, SDF alliance and Manbij military council spokesman Sharfan Darwish told Reuters.
"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching for it," he told Reuters.
In 2015, the Clintons earned $10.75 million and paid the federal tax rate 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax return on Friday, saying that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had incomes of $10.75 million in that year and had a real tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton was given $1 million in charity, mostly to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton contributed nearly $5.3 million in tuition fees to the common fund, and the former Secretary of State gave $3 million in income to his Secretary of State, Simon, for his $3.5 million stipend.
Clinton’s co-candidate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife, Anne Holton, have released tax returns in 10 years.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a model for financial transparency,” said Jennifer Palmieri, who helped Clinton campaign.
On the other hand, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and is backtracking on his earlier promises to make his tax returns public.
It is customary for candidates for president of the United States to publish their tax returns, even if they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers cited an audit by the U.S. Treasury Department as the reason for his refusal to publish the tax return.
"Your move," Hillary Clinton's campaign aide said on Twitter, referring to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
Michael Cohen, a special adviser to Trump, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to make a tax return public until the audits are completed.
According to Trump’s critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other members of the Republican Party, they agree that his rejection raises questions about his net income, contributions to the charity, trade deals, and various other relationships, including relations with Russia.
Clinton made a strong statement on the issue and released a video on Friday in which she recalls how the high-ranking Republicans are urging Trump to make his tax returns public.
On Thursday, I will mention the issue in my speech on economic issues in Michigan.
“She refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have been doing for decades — to publish their tax returns,” she told the crowd.
Politico said Trump has paid no or very low taxes in the last two years of the 1990s, and a New York Times columnist cited a number of tax advisers and accountants who claim he can do so today.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the election of the president.
Clinton is pushing a rule named after billionaire Warren Buffett that would ensure that anyone who earns more than $1 million a year pays a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
Last week, Buffett at the Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, where Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he also went through an IRS audit and that Trump was “not afraid” of the financial office, but of voters.
Clinton’s campaign published tax returns back to 2007 in the United States.
Clinton, who now lives in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent between 2007 and 2014 and a combined tax of about 40.5%.
The Clintons’ 2015 tax return shows that, unlike most Americans, they make only $100 in their income.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which Clinton reported a dividend and interest income of $109,000.

Condoms filled with chilli or fireworks for the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from entering human dwellings — throwing condoms filled with chilli powder at them.
This procedure proved to be successful and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the American environmental organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes this procedure and trains volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use this non-violent procedure in four steps to protect their homes and interests.
Many of them used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, which is dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they developed this ... toolkit, we’ve seen a change in behavior in these communities. People are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” said Damian Bell, executive director of the Honeyguide Foundation.
The first and second step is to light the passing elephant with a flashlight and start the horn.
If this does not deter him, the so-called "chill cloud" will be thrown out.
Chilli powder mixed with salt with a firecracker wrapped in a condom, its end is so busy that only a knot looks out of it.
After firing, the condom explodes and a fine powder of chilli is sprayed into the air.
Most of the time, just one loop is enough and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is to fire the fireworks, which will cause a loud, clear explosion.
A Jewish director leans against a Berlin hotel for removing a code to call Israel at the "request" of Arabs - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin has sparked a media outcry after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have a code for calling Israel, according to an employee on the basis of Arab clients’ “request.”
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Holocaust documentary “Shoah”, vented his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German daily FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the list of hotel calling codes.
However, the state has not been listed among the countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and erased?
Written by Lanzmann.
The Kempinski Bristol Hotel instead offers the option of calling to Israel via its own call centre.
The director was looking for an explanation and turned to the hotel reception with the problem.
The answer he received, Lanzmann said, “shocked.”
The hotel employee replied that the measure was “determined at the discretion of Kempinski Hotels’ management.”
The director’s reason for this step was even more nuanced.
“Most of our guests are Arabs and they have requested that Israel’s call code be erased,” Lanzmann said in his letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israel’s ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, called the case “a great shame”.
We were horrified and shocked by the events.
It is a great shame in itself.
The fact that something like this happened in Germany and in such a hotel chain is even more shameful.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions," he said.
The incident sparked a strong online reaction, people called it a scandal.
Some believe that the Kempinski Hotel simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
"Humble yourself," says another post, pointing out that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm street, is located near the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel newspaper, the hotel itself quickly carried out any accusations by calling the event a "overlook" and "apologizing" to Lanzman.
"There has never been a direct order" not to include Israel in the list of codes for calls, quoted by the Suddeutsche Zeitung representative of the Kempinski Hotel.

Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
A clash between students and police took place in Sao Paulo, Brazil on Thursday, when students gathered for a demonstration against government reforms in the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The problem arose when the government’s orderly services tried to disperse the students, which ended with the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration in order to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals made by San Paulo Governor Gerald Alckmin to save money is also the closure of nearly a hundred public schools and the relocation of 300,000 students.
Some of the demonstrators could be seen spraying inscriptions against the wall against the interim president Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets in support of ousted President Dilma Rousseff when the country’s Senate decided to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, after the lifting of sanctions between Moscow and Tehran, trade turnover increased by 70.9 percent in the year-on-year comparison.
According to the ambassador, since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, there has been an increase in interest from Russian companies that trade in the country.
Russian companies are renewing existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
Specifically, Russia’s exports to Iran jumped 91.5 percent to reach $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The surge in trade was ensured by the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons," the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects Russia to visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, Russia’s diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, mostly tourist visas.
For the first time, Iran has been ranked among the top 20 countries by the number of tourists coming to Russia.
It is safe to say that the record number of tourists from Iran to Russia from last year will be exceeded," he said.
At the same time, Iran is visiting a relatively small number of Russians. The ambassador hopes that there will be a change.
"I can personally recommend a visit to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the monuments of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition," he said.
Callum Skinner hastens home after the British won gold in cycling
Scotland's Callum Skinner walked into the Hall of Fame in a men's team sprint at the Velodrome in Rio last night as the VB trio defended the 2012 London title.
A 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of the brake he took for his Scot Sir Chris Hoy, and a young legend delighted when he made his way to the finish line and stole the victory from the hands of the favored New Zealand.
Britain won surprisingly four years ago and Hoy won the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the same trick after finishing a modest sixth in the world track cycling championship in March, even though Hoy meanwhile ended his career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the specialized opening racer Jamie Staff.
Hinds appeared just in time.
After Hoye's departure, the place was also released, which he tried to fill with Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.
Skinner was the man of the British coaches and the search for potential has now been confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was champion with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner reached the Olympic record in qualifying, but the jersey was taken over in the first round by New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward and Skinner kept the lead.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation when Hindes went on a higher gear to slow down and allow Kenny and partly even Skinner to keep pace.
Today the race was watched from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes took the stage, he did not let his eyes go.
Thirty-two-year-old Skinner, a native of Glasgow, said: “It’s a flattering comparison.”
I'm here to get the best out of myself and honor my name.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the best.
It was just unbelievable.
There is no better way to win it.
After a triumph alongside Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he had fallen on the track after a slow start.
The remark was later withdrawn and the British rivals had no option to appeal.
There was no such problem this time around this victory.
Hindes said, "With all those British flags on the stands, I felt like I was in London."
In the last three months, we've all worked together as a team.
We have lost in many world races, so winning the Olympics again is just amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for a nation that has won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then a successful five days awaits us at the velodrome.
With the form Kenny has shown, it is not inconceivable that he would repeat Hoy’s success and win three gold medals at one Olympics at the same time.
That would mean a total of six golds and one silver medal for Kenny – who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy – on 23 March (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, on this day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister also celebrate their birthdays).
No matter how much Hoy got.
Next, Kenny will take part in the sprint, which starts today and will last for another three days.
A twenty-eight-year-old native of Bolton said, "I'm enjoying this now.
The team race is always the best.
You win along with others.
To be honest, winning for yourself is a bit lonely.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood."
It was the only medal race of the day, but Britain was waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the four-kilometer racing team race.
They finished with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record, which fell in London in 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and the finals (22:42) take place on the second day of the race, which Wiggins will certainly focus on.
Yesterday, before the qualifying race, he was debating with the commissioner when the referee asked him to measure the height.
In a similar women’s race that continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie set a world record with a time of 4:13,260.
The VB team relied on their strong track cycling team and dominated the mid-season of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After a truly exceptional performance, showing absolute superiority in Beijing and London, expectations fell during preparations for Rio.
Dramatic events took place in the background, most recently the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April due to accusations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the career of giants such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as evidenced by the first night of the race at the velodrome, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team can deliver top performance with perfect timing could be confirmed again.
The uncertain future of the Portland tavern after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of Portland’s aluminum plant in Victoria – and the jobs of hundreds of workers – is uncertain because of the power plant that supplied the company with electricity and which informed one of the owners of the plant’s intention to terminate the electricity supply contract. It is expected that all supply contracts will be delivered.
This step comes after the Victoria state government earlier this year decided not to extend the provision of subsidies that keep the company going.
The 20-year fixed grant will expire in November.
At Alcoa Portland, up to 2,000 jobs may be at risk.
Up to 2,000 jobs – direct or indirect – may be at risk of closure.
And because the tavern consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there may be other lavatory impacts.
Alcoa closed the Point Henry plant in 2014, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoa's Portland-based restaurant is on the verge of closure.
This move follows several years of speculation about the future of the company, originally in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the plant’s production prices.
AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it expects some of the other three owners will also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the plant is a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, with small commercial shares held by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects that the Portland plant will continue to operate, in other words, that the demanding demand for electricity from the tavern will continue," she said.
AGL stated that the contracts are so-called "insurance contracts", which were to come into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
"AGL continues to expect that the contracts will participate in the profit for fiscal year 2017," the plant said.
Any potential impact on AGL’s earnings since fiscal year 2018 is currently further limited due to the strong commodity market outlook for wholesale electricity prices.
The AGL said it had already written down the value of the contracts according to its $187 million ledger “in case it was terminated.”
Alcoa said the decision to terminate the contract "does not affect its ... ability to operate a tavern or secure the supply of electricity to the tavern."
The company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to go into effect in November of this year, though it still needs to explain why it stepped down.
Analysts are very cautious about the possible closure of the Portland tavern in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle as a result of the weak economy in the sector.
AGL operations manager Stehpen Mikkelsen, who turned to analysts earlier this week, said Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity a year and Tomago around 900 megawatts a year.
If both of these companies were to withdraw from the market, this would mean a substantial reduction in market demand [electricity].
It would not be good for us as a producer," he said.
Kendall is not only the star of the reality TV show Kardashians - now it's the cover of September Vogue
Kendall Jenner, a model and the fourth daughter of mother-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the front page of the September issue of American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, the brand’s ambassador Estee Lauder, who showcased at fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
“In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this front page,” Kendall wrote.
The revelation of the title page was followed by a bizarre (or simply a continuation of the humor in the presentation of the Kardashians?) staged video, in which the entire family of the Kardashians-Jenners (baroque rioters Rob and Caitly and with them all favorite uncle of the show business, Sea Upping, producer of the film).
It's the neglected storyline of almost every "birthday" part of a children's TV show (Seacrest says, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the honesty of the cartoon rabbit on the show at eight o'clock in the morning), but Kris somehow needed to make sure that the other audience was alive.
Because when we look at the September issue of Vogue, we’ve definitely entered a new era of the Kardashians.
Kim's older sister may have pushed Kendall onto the cover of Vogue (she was on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the headline of the September issue of the magazine is a different league.
The September issue of Vogue magazine is the best-selling issue of the year.
The publication, which by its thickness resembles a book for advertising purposes rather than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionista calculated that out of 832 pages in last year’s edition, there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The revelation of the star, which will appear on the front page, is unexpectedly expected, so it is no wonder that in the past two years, the images of the magazine have escaped even before its official publication.
Among the women who have appeared on the cover in the past are Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista or Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more "celebrities who make models" than "models who are celebrities."
Jennifer Lawrence, the Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador, appeared on the cover in 2013, a year later she was honored by Lagy Gaga.
But while it’s highly unlikely that Kendall — who the magazine describes as the “breakthrough model” of her generation — will fall into the first category, she’ll be in very good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, nor stars of reality shows, or children of today who know how to make a well-cut video (although Jenner represents all of this).
They are demonstrably talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the front page last year, had one of the strongest years of her career thanks to the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner’s success.
Her position in the fashion world will always be difficult due to her participation in the reality show.
Stephanie Seymore, the original Victoria's Secret model, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid in June and called them "whores of the moment".
These feelings flared up again with the news that Jenner would appear on the cover of Vogue.
But this discontent is out of place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of September Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the truest sense.
He plays for Mark Jacobs.
She's selling you make-up from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their own paywalls.
She's selling photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which she took for LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time she acts on a reality show, maybe just as one of the ways to see Kourtney and her kids.
Community Legal Aid Centers Reject 160,000 People a Year
More than 160,000 of the most vulnerable citizens are denied legal aid in community centres each year, and in the sector itself, they are preparing for the impacts that will have further financial constraints on the already overburdened service.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and people without the financial means to be able to fight against unjust displacement and the like - are already turned down at the moment when they seek free legal aid.
Community legal services, which are already so strained to crack, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, these centers will lose an additional 30 percent of federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of Community Legal Aid Centers at Queenslade, said that according to the National Association of Community Legal Aid Centers’ latest summary report, 5,000 people are turned down each year.
Mr Farrell said that without abrogation of the federal government's decision, the situation would worsen.
“Community legal aid centres in Queensland are chronically underfunded, meaning thousands of people are denied the vital services they need,” he said.
People who have escaped from relationships with the rapist, people with excessive and crippling debts, families going through separation, workers who are unfairly released – all of these people have problems with legal dimensions and this report shows that they have no chance of getting the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30 percent, leading to an additional 1,000 vulnerable people from Queensland having to navigate complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on Attorney General and Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately prevent this funding cut, so that people get the help they need when they get into legal trouble.
In the past year, the state government has received its commitment to ensure the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now is the time to look at the needs of community legal aid centers and the communities of their clients and Palaszczuk’s government must invest in this important work.
A lawsuit against Donald Trump's campaign after a member of staff allegedly aimed a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign has been sued for alleged inaction after they were told that the director of operations in North Carolina in February was pointing a gun at a staff member while driving a jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday at a Charlotte state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software trainer for the state campaign.
Bordini said he had been waiting months for the situation to be resolved internally before coming to the conclusion that “it will not happen that way.”
Director Earl Phillip "indicated the gun's fingers, put the right pointer on the trigger, and pointed the head at Vincent's cheek," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
According to the file, Bordini, after a complaint to the local and regional leadership of the campaign, found that at least four other people had experienced the same thing with Phillip.
"The weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The lawsuit comes just two days after a Republican presidential candidate raised an eyebrow when he told voters in North Carolina that they could step in with gun owners and gun owners (which is regulated in the U.S. Constitution’s second amendment) if his opponent Hillary Clinton will be elected president.
Trump’s campaign says the media has taken his words out of context and that Trump has not defended violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini seeks compensation from the campaign for negligent surveillance and from Phillip for endangering personal safety, unlawful use of force, and causing emotional harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to get a statement from Phillip were unsuccessful.
The WCCB, a local news outlet in Charlotte, said Phillip had recently left the campaign.
The call to his consulting company Innovative Consulting Services was not answered in a short period of time.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is running a controversial election campaign.

Britain must continue to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of renewal and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, Heathrow is hugely attractive, just as London was in 2012, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all our nations and regions will be able to benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games have made a huge contribution to both Startford and the East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new teaching places, 40,000 new jobs, and end the unemployment of young people in the vicinity of the airport.
Just like before the 2012 London Olympics, there will be those who will think that the expansion of Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be ridiculed on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow it turns out that they were wrong.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project involving many people and companies, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of <0xC2><0xA3>211 billion, to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both in the vicinity of the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow that has put in place a <0xC2><0xA3>11 billion infrastructure investment programme on schedule and with a fixed budget, starting with Terminal T5 – which was voted the best terminal in the world five years in a row, after Terminal T2, which was built between the two busiest runways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third rung, worth <0xC2><0xA3>16 billion of private investment.
The London 2012 Games were a huge success for the UK and I am confident that the Heathrow extension will be as well.
It is time to continue to spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and to expand Heathrow, to secure trading for the future and to leave a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy Minister of Finance for Business Affairs.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in a cat and mouse game in ad blocking
Attempts to circumvent ad-blocking programs have made it a game of cat and mouse for companies that make money from online marketing. At least that’s what one of the companies that program such software says.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus posted a post on its website stating that users could update filters in their program and block ads on that social network again.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the coding around ads to make it more difficult for ad filters to find out which parts of the page are advertising.
Adblock, however, now claims that the new codes have already bypassed.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of war between the open source ad blocking community and those who try to bypass it has been going on since ad blocking was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come up with another fix of its own.
The fact that the company that owns the world’s largest social network was involved in the war only proves how big the problem of blocking ads for industry has become.
According to a study conducted by Pagefair last year, Adobe uses advertising filters around 200 million people worldwide — almost four times as many as it did in 2013.
Mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook’s ad revenue, with 1.03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
The spokesperson said that the company is opposed to advertising filters on desktops, because mobile advertising filters for mobile applications for social networks and Instagram do not work.
The ads on desktops still represent a profit so high that Facebook decides to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday it would update an ad preferences tool to give people a better control over how ads are displayed to them.
Facebook said on Thursday that new Adblock filters are worrying them because they could also block content on the site that is unrelated to the ad.
“This is not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Ad blocking is an insensitive tool, which is why we’d rather focus on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
A woman was hit by a car on the Swiss motorway.
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses to an incident in which a woman tried to commit suicide on the highway in the early hours of Thursday morning.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight on Thursday.
Police in Vaud said in a statement that the "desperate act" actress lay in the dark on the road and was overtaken by several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill herself and was hit by several cars, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been questioned, but according to the police, all of them have not yet been identified. Police are calling on these drivers and all others who witnessed the accident to report.
A criminal investigation was opened, a "logical" step in a situation like this, Gilles Hofstetter, a lawyer, told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It is still necessary to find out if any of the drivers involved will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent an accident?
The plaintiff must find out," Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases from the past five years, it seems that drivers will not be held responsible.
In both cases - one of which was a person walking on the highway - it was decided that motorists could not expect a pedestrian to cross the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, a police officer was acquitted of murder for negligence after she hit and killed a man on the A1 highway near Paynerne on the night of August 2014.
The court heard that the 22-year-old victim had drunk alcohol and fainted on the road.
The court found that the police officer - who responded to the emergency call - was driving in a reasonable manner and that the man's presence on the road was "completely exceptional and unpredictable," the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident that occurred at Morges should report to the police on the phone numbers 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is a popular destination for the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech Travel Agencies and Agencies (A<0xC4><0x8C>CKA) expects up to 20,000 visitors to Prague as part of the Prague Pride.
On Friday, the Executive Director of A<0xC4><0x8C>CKA Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Pet<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> announced this.
The sixth year of Prague Pride began on August 8, with the festival bringing the lives of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people closer together.
About 35,000 people took part in the event last year.
"Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for a high degree of tolerance and a wide range of specialized companies," Pet<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
According to a survey of organizers, foreign visitors to the festival spend an average of 3,100 crowns per person per day.
Gay tourists are provided with special maps of Prague with a complete list of gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
"For tourism in general, the LGBT clientele is very lucrative, interested in stays in higher price relationships with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others," Pet<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
This year, the first Pride Tourism Symposium will be held as part of the festival programme.
It is taught by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the USA and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme this year is love, but the event will also deal with several thematic areas, which are family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The top of the festival on Saturday will be a traditional parade with allegorical cars, which will go from Wenceslas Square to Letn<0xC3><0xA1>.
The parade, attended by thousands of people in recent years, this year honors the minute of silence of the victims of the June attack at the Orlando nightclub, where the attacker shot dead 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Mat are celebrating 40 years.
Intractable cutlers Pat and Mat, whose efforts usually end in disaster, have been entertaining both small and large audiences for forty years.
The pilot part of this evening's series was directed by Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Bene<0xC5><0xA1>, which premiered on August 12, 1976.
Behind the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, were drawn jokes of the artist and director Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Bene<0xC5><0xA1>, who invented for the magazine with two knives Mr. Ouhol<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek and Sedlec.
Bene<0xC5><0xA1> then invited playwright Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Kub<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek and artist Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Jir<0xC3><0xA1>nek to collaborate and together they created the film Kut<0xC3><0xA1>ci.
Today's form with yellow and red t-shirt and ball and radio received the characters in 1979, when the series for Slovak television began to appear in the short film Prague.
Pat and Mat were given names in 1985, this time they were filmed directly for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990, Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Bene<0xC5><0xA1> founded his own studio of the animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, other works continued with other creators, many of which were contributed by Bene<0xC5><0xA1>'s son Marek.
Currently, there are over ninety episodes with the stories of these puppets, with which everything pours under their hands, but they never get angry at each other and are always full of optimism, ideas and puppet enthusiasm and are finally satisfied with their work, which proves the famous gesture "...and that's it!".
Pat and Mat have even moved from TV screens to books, DVDs to theaters, and characters or other toys with the depiction of Pat and Mata are a hit of any toy industry.
A fairy tale for Fiji and for two-year Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen for you one sports and one of life.
They both have a good ending.
So let's take a look.
Fiji has achieved historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole country?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical friend and is happy with her.
What are the things people spend the most on airports?
This is a report from the World Wide Web on Friday.
The first medal of the Olympic Games.
Historical success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
The rugby union team of this archipelago defeated the United Kingdom in the final of the Olympic seven-man rugby tournament.
This is the first medal that Fiji has won for itself at the Olympics.
It took sixty years to wait for the first precious metal to be mined, since the first expedition to the Olympic Games was launched.
A great credit for the success of the coach of Fiji.
It's ironic that he's Brit Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the final, the British citizen could be satisfied, unlike his fellow countrymen.
“Let’s play freely and easily and see if we can handle the biggest game in our history,” he said.
Fiji eventually came under its sovereign control, and a small state with 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing an Olympic fairy tale.
This was reported by the French newspaper Le Monde.
A new friend and happiness for a little girl.
2-year-old Harmony-Rose Ivy Allen, who has been without hands and feet for 11 months, has a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mom, she's just like me," said the two-year-old, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter likes the doll's hands and feet and then sits together without prosthetics.
Harmonia was diagnosed with meningitis type B in less than a year of her life, with doctors giving her only a ten percent chance of survival.
There's nothing I wouldn't love about her.
She is beautiful, smart, funny and never gives up.
He's got an oversight, too.
I saw her introduce herself to the other children with the words "Hello, I'm Harmony and I don't have hands," the mother added.
Look at the joy that the doll brought.
What do we spend the most money on at the airport?
CNN reports that people at airports spend the most money on bottled water.
Hudson’s travel essential stores have released data for the past year, summarizing 10 products that customers buy most often in its airport stores.
Water was supremely first.
Drinks were generally very popular, with eight in the top ten.
The ninth place was occupied by a large package of M&M candies with coconut flavor.
Can you guess who's closing the top ten?
As one of the above things, you can’t eat.
According to CNN, it's The Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at airports include: New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
Among them are US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The rowing sovereigns.
We're just going to win, Murray and Bond laughed.
New Zealand rowers Eric Murray and Hamish Bond have ruled the pair without a helmsman for seven years and have confirmed their dominance at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the unmatched pair switched to a smaller crew after the Beijing Olympics and has been crushing competition since 2009.
In the Rodrigo de Freitase lagoon, they scored their 69th win in a row in the quarterfinals.
What are we different from the others?
“We’re just prettier,” Murray joked during the Olympic regatta, when he was supposed to answer questions about the dominance of the New Zealand pair.
To be honest, we don’t do anything different than others.
We're just training hard, very hard.
And we're constantly trying to improve our technique, that's our philosophy," Murray said more seriously.
Their dominance is remarkable also because they are physically different.
Murray is an almost two-meter and one-hundred-pound hunter, academically looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
They also have a different nature.
Bond studies and finances, and Murray has a charity boxing match behind him.
That's why he doesn't spend a lot of time together outside of rowing.
Eric gets into the boat basically with the fact that we can't lose.
We're just going to win.
“I tend to think about what can go wrong,” said Bond, who also said at a press conference that Murray was dominant on the crew.
It was he who always answered first, and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
On the water, however, he destroys his opponents with a calm force.
They are going at their own pace, and although often still in the middle of the track are not in the lead, to their gradual acceleration, opponents have not yet found a recipe.
We raced on a two-kilometer track and we never wanted to drive the first kilometer in a row.
We're just trying to go at a pace that no one else can.
“We know what we have to do to win,” Murray, 43, said.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championships.
They also triumphed in 2007, when they were both members of the Golden Four without a helmsman.
Just after the unexpected failure of the larger crew at the Beijing Olympics a year later, they decided to move to a double without a helmsman.
At the Olympics in London, the biggest defeat of their career was apparently over and the dominance was confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn't ask us anything.
This time it was a little more fun.
"We knew it was going to be fucking hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally well," Murray said.
We all know that they want to overthrow us from the throne.
We still have that target on our backs.
But we are trying to be half a step ahead of everyone, he added.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for studying Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, the surface of which is hot, without water and saturated CO2, conditions similar to those on Earth could prevail.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low speed of Venus' rotation can be explained by its dense atmosphere.
However, according to the latest simulations, Venus may have once boasted a rare Earth-like atmosphere while spinning slowly.
The model also dealt with the earlier topography of Venus.
There were probably regions of the planet that were drier than on Earth, but once upon a time there was enough water and geographical diversity on it to rule over life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used to also use the Sun, which was 30 percent more attenuated.
“In the simulation of the GISS Venus model during slow rotation, it exposes its daily side to the sun for almost two months at a time,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a new report.
This heats the surface and creates rain, which creates a dense layer of clouds that behave like an umbrella and protect the surface from excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures, which are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model compiled the story of Venus similar to the evolution previously hypothesized by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past -- over a few billion years -- it was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans evaporated and the water vapors were burned by ultraviolet light.
Hydrogen has escaped and only a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas has remained -- that's Venus as we know it today.
The researchers published their results from the new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Colorado Avalanche coach
On Thursday, Patrick Roy resigned from his position as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche team as a reason for not being able to participate in the decision-making process on the team's issues.
Colorado’s executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club would immediately start looking for a new coach.
“For the past three years, I’ve served as the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche, with energy, passion and determination,” Roy, 50, said in a statement.
For a long time and intensively over the years, I have been thinking about how I can improve the team, give it the depth it needs, and take it to the next level.
To achieve this, it is necessary that the visions of the coach and the vice president of hockey operations are consistent with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
The Sakic, which Roye accepted on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today," Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him well in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the league's best coach during his first season with the Avalanche 2013/2014.
He led the team to 112 points and first place in the Central Division, but Colorado faced Minnesota in the first round of the play-off, and in the last two years he has not always been able to win games after the season.
In the 2015/2016 season, the Avalanche team scored 39:39:4 and missed five points to get a second wild card in the Western Conference.
Goalkeeper Roy, who signed up for the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times -- twice with the Montreal Canadiens and twice with the Avalanche.
Oil rig workers in the North Sea resume talks and call off strike
High-level representatives of the negotiating parties said strikes over wages for oil rig workers in the North Sea have been halted, while all parties to the dispute have met for a new round of negotiations.
Strikes against the oilfield services company Wood Group have sporadically taken place on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and Unite and RMT trade unions can confirm that they have agreed to resume the process for resolving current non-conformities," the company said in a statement.
Starting next week, we will have a series of all-day meetings over the next few weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade union organizations, their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, is up to 30 percent in protest against wage cuts.
Wood Group cut rates this year and paid its suppliers in the North Sea about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
The reduction in company rates comes after a 10% reduction for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would provide the company with room to cope with the market downturn.
On the other hand, Shell has cut thousands of people out of its payrolls and announced plans to abandon operations in the oil and gas field in up to 10 countries to modernize its processes – immediately after a mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation associated with Britain’s June decision to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes of a generation that led to a strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the region’s economy.
“In the North Sea and across the country, we need an economy that works for everyone, not just some,” he said.
By comparison, in 2016 nearly $1.4 billion is expected to be invested in new projects in the North Sea, while the average over the past five years has been around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of stars in Pleiades
The latest mission of Kepler's space telescope to help astronomers is to obtain an almost complete list of the speeds of rotation of stars from the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data helps astronomers understand why stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds, and also how the rotation time is related to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between stellar matter, its age, and even the history of its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech’s Center Infrared Processing and Analesis.
The Pleiades star cluster is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are now reaching maturity and have been around for over 125 million years.
Now it's spinning the fastest.
In moments of maximum rotation speeds, these adolescent stars release a huge amount of stellar wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star ages, its speed of rotation slows down.
Kepler measures the speed of rotation of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of detectable points on stars -- similar to sunspots.
According to the latest data on the speed of rotation, larger stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to the dancers, the larger ones make the pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
“In the ‘ballet’ of Pleiades, we see that the slower-moving stars are more massive, while the ones that spin the fastest are usually very light stars,” Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades star cluster is so close, it serves as an ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of stars and the speed of rotation.
"The Pleiades provide us with an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, in younger and older stars," Rebull said.
There’s still a lot we want to know about how, when, and why stars slow their speed of rotation and, so to speak, “hang their dancing shoes on nails.”
Rebull and her colleagues described in detail the latest analysis of the speed of rotation of the Pleiades in three studies, which will soon be published in the journal Astronomical Journal.
Is a Qualification Agreement Necessary?
If I did not apply, would the qualification agreement not be concluded and could I move to another hospital after a few months?
Is it even possible to work after graduation without enrolling in special education?
The point is that in the field in which I would like to work, there is now a job available only in a somewhat more distant hospital, but in about six months a job could be available in another, where I would then like to work.
So I don’t know how to deal with the situation for about six months, the question continues.
The answer is Mgr. Lenka Vlkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
No legislation provides for the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - the hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institution governed by the Labour Code and may be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the return of the costs incurred associated with increasing or deepening the qualification of the employee.
In the area of health, however, there is a long-term pressure to not conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the work mobility of health workers, and not all hospitals currently require this agreement.
According to Act No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for obtaining and recognizing professional competence and specialized competence for the performance of the medical profession of a doctor, dentist and pharmacist, the participation in specialized education is considered to be an enhancement of the qualification (not even a qualification).
This means that a qualification agreement can be concluded under the Labour Code only if the costs reach at least CZK 75,000.
There is no legal requirement or obligation to apply for special education.
The law only lays down the conditions for the application for inclusion in the field of special education.
However, under the law, a doctor is entitled to exercise the profession of a doctor already by completing the necessary university studies, even if under the conditions laid down by law (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized competence in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation in which professional practice completed in another field of specialization may be included in the specialist education of a doctor, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational program.
Theoretically, it would be possible to count the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the situation of the questioner.
However, given that I do not know the circumstances of this case, it can be recommended to consult with the competent department of the Ministry of Health (Department of Science and Medical Professions), since the Ministry of Health by law provides an advisory and consulting service related to the inclusion in its specialized education and training.
The advisory service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, of which every doctor must be a member.
Doctors in Syria's Halab are calling for U.S. intervention.
The United States has made no effort to end the siege (insurgent parts of the city by government troops), and has not used its influence to enforce the protection of civilians, according to a letter to the White House.
“We do not need tears, compassion, or even prayers; however, we desperately need to create a no-fly zone over eastern Halab to stop the attacks, and we need international action to ensure that Halab will not be surrounded again,” the doctors said.
Russian forces, which support an army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, have announced that from today they will stop every day for three hours strikes in the Halab area to allow safe passage of humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 to 12:00 CEST, all military activities, air strikes and artillery fire are to be stopped.
The head of UN humanitarian operations, Stephen O'Brien, welcomed it, but stressed that at least a two-day truce was needed.
According to the AFP, 15 of the 35 doctors who work in the eastern part of Halabu, already controlled by the rebels, turned to Obama in a letter.
It says that during the five-year war, witnesses witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world is watching and noticing how complex Syria is, but it is doing little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation of the population from the Syrian regime and Russia sound like slightly veiled threats, pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors have said.
Doctors said there had been 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria in the past month, including 15 on hospitals where they work.
The saddest part is that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
Young children come to our emergency room with injuries so severe that we have to choose among them those who are most likely to survive.
And sometimes we don't even have the materials we need to help them, the doctors described.
Two weeks ago, four newborns suffocated when an explosion interrupted oxygen supplies to their incubators.
They took a breath and then their life ended - before they could really begin, they reminded.
The army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russian forces, has surrounded the rebel-held eastern part of Halabu in recent weeks, with more than 200,000 people inside without food supplies.
The rebels, who are under constant attack by the Russian and Syrian air forces, managed to break through the encirclement on Saturday after three weeks and launch a counter-offensive.
Both sides then arrived in the city and its surroundings strengthened.
