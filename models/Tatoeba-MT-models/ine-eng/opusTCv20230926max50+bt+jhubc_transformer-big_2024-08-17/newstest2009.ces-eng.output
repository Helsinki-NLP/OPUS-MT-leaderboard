The Prague Stock Exchange fell to minus at the end of trading
After the morning’s sharp decline, the Prague stock exchange corrected losses.
Transactions with <0xC4><0x8C>EZ shares reached almost half of the normal daily trade.
The Prague Stock Exchange has been on its way since the beginning of Tuesday's trading to its Monday downturn, when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the decline in shares on Wall Street is behind the decline.
This is also how the market reacts to the outcome of the US House of Representatives vote, which refused to support the stabilisation plan for the financial sector there.
Falling Stocks in Asia
The dramatic fall on Tuesday saw stock markets in Asia, although the indexes eventually wiped out some of the losses over the course of the day.
The Hang Seng Index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange declined nearly four percent during trading, but later wiped out some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell by 3.8 percent, while markets in Shanghai were closed.
Stocks on the Sydney stock exchange lost more than five percent, but eventually lost 4.3 percent.
Taiwan's stock market fell by 3.6 percent on the index.
"The timing of the bailout in the US is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world," Hong Kong Monetary Authority chief Joseph Yam said in a statement.
Hong Kong, although part of China, determines its monetary policy independently, i.e. independently of the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, U.S. lawmakers should quickly return to the negotiations and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it is likely that other countries will feel the effects.
The Bloody Bath of American Stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to support the financial system, which was supposed to spend up to $700 billion (almost 12 trillion CZK).
Lawmakers ignored President George Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloody spa on Monday, and major stock indexes recorded the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell nearly seven percent, and it last fell to a similar extent in 1987.
The index fell before the vote, but as soon as it turned out that the proposal did not pass in the House, the index found itself in free fall.
Congress: U.S. government could pump $700 billion into banks
The top representatives of the US Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of agreement on financial assistance for the US financial system.
It will be voted on early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a rescue plan in the form of financial aid for the U.S. financial system in the amount of $700 billion (approximately 12 trillion crowns).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen must complete some details of the agreement before they can publish the final version of the law and vote on it.
The financial system support plan will be discussed on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to sources, the Senate could vote on the plan first on Wednesday.
According to economists, the announcement that the rescue plan will be approved should be the first significant psychological factor for the recovery of financial markets.
After that, however, there will be a "cut-off" thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms by which to help markets to achieve even in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differences on what the shape of the market stabilisation package should look like," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
He said the final vote could be held on Sunday.
On Sunday night, lawmakers met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give a definitive shape to the government fund.
It should buy out unsold mortgage assets from financial companies, which pull financial firms into heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a definitive agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We still need to continue with the recovery plan, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis is having a significant impact on stock markets, which are falling sharply.
According to Democratic Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, lawmakers are trying to reach a final deal in Congress on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors about trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in a time zone where a Congressional decision could affect Monday’s trading.
However, it is not yet clear when the two chambers of the US Congress will vote on the law, nor whether they can tie the last-minute negotiations to a problem.
Legislators hope it will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law will see a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is expected to be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has demanded.
However, Congress may block the release of the remaining amount if it feels that the program is not fulfilling its function, in the wake of another $100 billion and later a final $350 billion.
Bush appreciates progress in negotiations
The president may veto this decision, but Congress may override his veto.
Despite these changes, however, the basic idea of the program, which was to obtain finance for the purchase of bad mortgage securities, the value of which has fallen because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to repay their mortgages, remained.
"We've worked out everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," Republican Senator Judd Gregg said.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday’s progress and appreciated “the two-party effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economies.”
Restrictions on gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the chief negotiator, said lawmakers had agreed to take responsibility for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing reliefs, and timing the financing of the plan.
The new law also aims to limit so-called golden parachutes for directors of companies participating in the program and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
It should be run by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on this, and we’ve made great progress toward a deal that will work and be useful for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also includes help for homeowners who have problems with repayment.
The government should negotiate new payments on the mortgages it buys in order to reduce the monthly cost of payments to borrowers and allow them to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological help
According to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Mark, the proposed plan is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
“And that’s because we don’t know what mechanism and at what price the troubled assets will be bought out.
This will be decisive for how the financial sector and the government share their losses," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now, or early next week, isn’t all that important, according to Mark.
"It is much more important that this week's congressmen agree that they support this plan and that it is consecrated as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that will be approved is the most important at the moment," Marek said.
Battle for Knife Blades: MP3 players against mobiles.
We will advise how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
It seems that it is better to just buy a phone.
Yet there are plenty of reasons why a person should get a separate player.
The choice depends entirely on the method of use and the claims of the future owner.
It’s probably hard to get a top expensive turntable at home to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
However, such music products on LPs do not originate and from a qualitative point of view there is no objective reason for this.
However, if vinyl with art rock, jazz or blues is pressed on your shelves, you probably dream of such a turntable at least.
It is the same with music on the go, that is, music compressed, simplified - music in MP3.
There are also price and quality categories.
For someone, it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns per player, as well as Pink Floyd fans will probably find it difficult to test the headphones for twenty crowns from the market.
Two extremes, between which there is enough room for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It also determines the battery life.
Some top-of-the-line music players can do much more than just play music, but what most mobile phones don’t do by chance.
No current device is as versatile as a phone.
In addition to the primary functions, telephony and essay mixing, he can play music and video, record both, he has a better camera, a worse camera and maybe he can even navigate.
And when we take into account smartphones and communicators, you will also have a small computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no TV takes pictures of anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the greatest sources of energy.
A small cell phone can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, usually much less.
In this direction, music players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more powerful.
For cheap phones, therefore, count on the fact that they will not play for more than a few hours.
If you still call here and there, get another charger to work for sure - this also applies to more expensive devices.
With MP3 players, you won’t have this problem, even the worst will last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music on your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB connector, and not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can cope with the miniature memory cards that are used in mobiles without reduction.
You do not need any special software for players except for the exceptions (iPod).
Just fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and players will already create their own music library sorted by the name of the performer, the name of the album, the genre or, for example, the rating of the user.
Some devices display only the tree structure of directories similar to Explorer in Windows, and some are able to both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with the operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobiles are more capable
When choosing a specific device, pay particular attention to the battery life, memory capacity, quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of control.
If your music is mainly behind the scenes and you listen to it every day for a short time, you just need any phone that plays MP3.
This is something that almost any mobile phone can do.
You don’t even have to keep track of what music formats your phone or player can play.
MP3 will handle everything and the vast majority of the music that gets to you will be in this format.
It is one of the most widespread, and in addition to it, the vast majority of devices can handle music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobiles also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
Simply visit the respective website of the operator (or other provider) via the mobile internet and buy a song or album.
This service could already in itself be a valid argument for the purchase of a music phone.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is lousy and is mostly limited to fast-paced radio hits.
The prices are also not the lowest.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their cell phones with them all the time.
Whenever you get the urge to listen to something, you tap your phone in your pocket while the MP3 player is lying forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or at least wired handsfree with you.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker that has almost every mobile, but only a minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of music phones will be for many price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
For three and four thousand crowns you will already get a very decent walkman.
Most of the time, however, you will be limited by the lack of output to normal headphones.
The best and most technically equipped phones, even with a 3.5 mm hole for ordinary headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
The advantage of the players is, among other things, easy operation.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can really control everyone.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of the control with a previously common tape recorder or, for example, a turntable is obvious.
There is no risk of collision in the form of a accidentally switched on mobile internet and subsequently a huge account for data transmission.
What device to use
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for exchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card, you will get up to two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can cope with 8 GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach for Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are one of the more demanding listeners, you should reach for specialized mobiles - walkmans (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate control buttons for MP3 and the comfort of operation is thus close to a separate MP3 player.
It is further in the field of Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles from the series walkman have the same user interface as independently sold MP3 players.
The same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours), MP3 players will take you away from the above-mentioned brands.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their partners in Western Europe.
Still, we're missing something here - a virtual operator that would make the classics cheaper.
Maybe it won't be long.
About the fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have written on Mobil.cz many times.
This was also confirmed by <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which pointed out that the price of SMS is higher in our country than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, there may be a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are holding so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to go into battle.
Perhaps it sounds paradoxical, after all, we have three mobile networks and penetration high over 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to swear that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (<0xC4><0x8C>TU) Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, who has expressed himself several times in the past that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic, often reminds them of this.
It is probably true that the classical operator with its own network probably no longer has much chance (after all, it would probably be difficult to search for frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
It was the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market that brought a significant reduction in prices, which then had to be responded to by classic operators.
Even before Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, voices similar to ours were heard in the UK.
But it turned out that the place for such operators is and can be really successful.
We don’t have to go too far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the launch of the Mobilking virtual operator in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator there.
Behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta, which in the Czech Republic owns, among other things, U:fona.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order for them to function effectively, they need far fewer customers than a conventional operator.
They do not carry with them a relatively high cost for the construction, operation and maintenance of a mobile network.
In the world, virtual operators usually profile as low-cost - they offer cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half cheaper than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can be quite a good move and a bet on the unscored target group.
This is because the operator is specifically focused on men.
“Administrative guys choose Mobilking – an operator they like and can trust,” says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether a similar concept as in Poland could be caught in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> doubts this: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmented approach, on which the majority of virtual operators are based.
In addition, it is relatively saturated from the point of view of the supply of services."
In the Czech Republic without a chance, mobile operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not look very promising.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries of our region," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, press spokesperson of the Penta financial group, told Mobil.cz in a telephone interview.
Indirectly, it confirmed that existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic are definitely not inclined to this idea.
On the contrary, it tries to do everything so that no potential competitor arises.
The GTS Novera Group has not been interested in launching a virtual mobile operator for a long time, which would like to take the next step to become a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
And the sooner, the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already managed to make progress with some of them in the negotiations," said Pavel Kaidl, a press spokesman for the group.
Maybe they are looking for better times.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual operator we should probably wait until the end of the year.
But for now, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment, we do not believe that there is room on the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any entity with a comprehensive and serious project in this area," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> from the Press Department of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 told Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokesman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> adds in rare agreement with O2's statement: "So far, we have not recorded any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which it would be possible to build further."
He added: “It’s hard to see a virtual operator in the T-Mobile network until the end of the year.
At this point, we would have to have a specific agreement on the table to be able to think in this short term."
Vodafone prefers to pay attention to meeting the requirements of its own 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> says: "By interacting with potential virtual operators, we are open, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
This is what we consider to be the most profitable from the point of view of our customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for fast mobile internet.”
Responsible authorities - with one-handed operators
The procedure of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a decrease in prices and thus to a decrease in their profits.
So why make it easier for such a competitor?
The fact that when the operators are involved, they can pull one rope, is also evidenced by the pulleys around the creation of U:fon.
Probably the greatest pressure towards CTU was at the time of the creation of the U:phone from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information from the <0xC4><0x8C>TU website.
But now U:fon is suitable as an argument for why the virtual operator should not be allowed.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> said: "The competitive environment of the mobile market has recently been further strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on him and, above all, on his services."
Due to this approach of mobile operators, however, the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory authorities is directly striking.
This is not just a CTU position, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other advanced countries - does not have the power to interfere in economic competition.
These belong exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (OECD).
But he took his typical position on the whole issue.
“The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator on the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not interesting enough for classical operators," Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa from the Department of External Relations of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS said in response to our question.
It is not surprising that the representatives of the operators have made such a statement.
From an authority that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and, among other things, make sure that no one abuses their position on the market, it is more than respectable.
In particular, when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: “In a foreign country where virtual operators are common, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to a reduction in prices for mobile phone services.”
However, the pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and the fall in prices is not in the interests of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
In fact, it is shocking on the whole case that there is only a touching consonance of three mobile operators, which results from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence, is offered entirely by itself.
Just as the exact same price of petrol at the filling stations is certainly just a coincidence and a fierce competitive battle.
"The Authority has not found any evidence of anti-competitive conduct in this case and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore has no corresponding increased responsibility for their conduct on the market.
The necessary tools for opening up the mobile market for virtual operators are probably also available to the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many points of contention.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by <0xC4><0x8C>TU, according to which telecommunications are the only market from the point of view of competition.
In such a market, of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer a different view - the creation of a virtual operator always requires the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator - quite logically - has a monopoly on its network.
So it must necessarily be dominant in a certain segment.
However, even if we do not accept this argument, it should be at least a warning for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS that the three mobile operators are proceeding in a similar way.
However, complaints from a number of interested parties (including those from GTS Novera) show that they face very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
The exercise of responsibility at <0xC4><0x8C>TU is then a fairly common trick in telecommunications, which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS gives away from the whole matter.
We have met with him in a number of similar cases.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendments to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the powers of the CTU to the field of competition in telecommunications failed to prevail, although a number of experts have since promised to improve the situation.
The <0xC3><0x9A>OHS representatives must know this more than well, but their interests are probably elsewhere.
It goes when no one's looking
At the same time, the functioning of some pseudo-virtual operators remains unnoticed, of which there are several in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that issue their own price lists of mobile phone services, but they are only partially public.
They are usually multi-level marketing companies.
Our own mobile phone services include Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many more.
The prices of these companies usually only reach the chosen ones.
The magic lies in the fact that the company acts as a classic corporate customer in relation to the operator, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a significant customer, he will then receive special price (and other) offers.
The problem is that the terms and conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit a similar resale.
"If there are cases that you are talking about, it could be a violation of the contractual terms that we would deal with and could result in the termination of cooperation with the company in question," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> answered our question on this issue.
However, it is highly unlikely that such activities would not be carried out by mobile operators to responsible people.
In particular, in the case of the three mentioned companies, there may be thousands of customers.
None of the operators are prevented from doing so.
In fact, these companies have negligible profits from their activities and, unlike real virtual operators, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> points out possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
In addition, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not held in their name, so they cannot have it fully available as regular customers of mobile operators."
That’s what should be at least weird.
In addition, another question is opened for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators are blindfolded by a similar procedure, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has relatively strong powers to disclose such activities, and if it does not want to, it may not be satisfied with the operators’ explanation that they have no idea of such a thing and their trading conditions prohibit it.
When we are not the most expensive
As has already happened several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has brought a noticeable drop in prices for services.
In almost all countries where virtual operators were created, classical operators tried to more or less defend their creation.
The arguments used by Jimi were virtually identical - too small or possibly too saturated a market, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In developed countries, however, it is precisely at this time that regulatory authorities have intervened, which have defended not the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Whether by formal measures or informal pressure, they achieved that the first virtual operator was created and others packed on it.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are throwing the whole case away like a hot potato.
From our experience, we cannot get rid of the impression that ambiguities in competences are more than suitable for them in these cases.
But let's not throw flint in the grain.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator is really soon to appear in our company, the Czech mobile market may be shifting again.
If one of the operators has admitted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, it will be difficult for the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS to remain in a position to refuse (discrimination) other interested parties.
And maybe we'll stop calling the rails than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four versions of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek on the occasion of the Day of Czech Statehood solemnly presented new recordings of the national anthem Kde dommoj.
The anthem was re-recorded by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vka.
There are four versions - with male or female solo vocals, in choir delivery and instrumental lyrics.
The song was sung by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the hymn are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to all four versions.
Belohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers the Czech national song to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he had deliberately chosen singers with young representative voices who are expressive and popular for singing solo variations.
"From the beginning, I was with both of them, and then I also tried to make sure that the choir had a clear diction, that the text was well understood, that they were in tune," he said.
The Czech National Anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
Song Where My Home Sounded for the first time in 1834 on the boards of the Stavov Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl supplemented by music by Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously took it for their own.
The first syllable of the song then became a natural part of the national anthem after the creation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
One of the seven state symbols remained even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
What is the "new" anthem?
Prague public transport on Wednesday for the first time on a chip
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be entered in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will enter the metro, trams and buses, who will have an electronic coupon in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At the moment, it can be purchased by about one hundred thousand people who own an Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have it uploaded to their chip card in the information centers and offices of the Transport Company in the metro stations Museum, Bridge, Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice Station, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>any, Rabylis.
Coupons can be purchased from yesterday also via the Internet on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than four hundred customers in the afternoon.
Those who start using the online store can definitely forget about the service windows in the metro stations, where they have had to regularly stand in long queues on paper tickets.
They buy the voucher over the Internet and upload it to one of the thirteen branches of the City Library on the Opencard card.
"In these places, passengers are provided with a desk with trained service that will help those interested in online shopping and will also upload a voucher purchased on their card," said Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>, a spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to upload electronic vouchers to Opencard in self-service vending machines, which are installed in several metro vestibules.
What do these machines look like?
They are red, ticket markers remind and passengers may have noticed them in the metro stations Roztyla, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"There are now five of them in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty of them," he added.
The coupon will check the place of the driver of the vending machine
The operation of the machines, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Just insert the Opencard chip card into them and the previously paid coupon will be uploaded to it itself.
Electronic coupons from tomorrow apply not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
That is, in suburban trains and bus lines with numbers 300 to 499, from which mainly the inhabitants of the Central Bohemian municipalities go to the capital.
"In trains included in Prague Integrated Transport, the guides are equipped with card readers, using which they determine the time and zone validity of the vouchers," explained Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal from Ropid, which compiles the timetables of Prague public transport.
The suburban buses have card readers built into the cash register at the driver’s side.
When entering, it is therefore necessary not only to show the chip card to the driver, but in addition, it is necessary to attach Opencard to a designated place on the side of the cash register.
This will allow the driver to check the validity of the recorded coupons.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the uploaded coupons, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information," Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who do not travel by suburban buses and do not remember when their voucher expires can go back to the self-service vending machines where the vouchers are loaded onto the card.
Here they are shown information about the validity of their documents on the display of the device.
Sudeten wanted a referendum after the United States
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans requested the incorporation of the Sumava into the United States.
This is the result of a letter that is stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States of America.
With such a wish, some groups of Sudeten Germans allegedly turned to the President of the United States in 1945.
This is due, among other things, to a letter that has been kept in a private archive and is now stored in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in a letter from the US president not to allow the return of the "Shumava County" - taken by Hitler on the basis of the Munich agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
“We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be really sure in words that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads, signed in the words “The people whose fate is <0xC5><0xA0>umava’s at heart.”
Since the connection to Czechoslovakia supposedly gives the Sudeten Germans - with knowledge of the Czech national nature - hope only for brutality, recklessness, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter of the American president ask that he take over the protectorate for the present and the present over <0xC5><0xA0>umava.
"We cannot believe that, whatever the opinion of a quarter of a million people, you would give this territory to a foreign state that oppresses and repels minorities and nothing at all, would contribute nothing to the victory of the Allies," the letter said.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is allegedly a fear of revenge for the "Czech oppressors".
If the president of the United States allegedly doubted the opinion of the Germans of Sumava, it was enough for him to hold a referendum in the county of Sumava on whether its inhabitants want to become part of the United States or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may sound a bit na<0xC3><0xAF>ve in today’s knowledge of post-war history, according to some historians it appropriately reflects the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least guess that it would be their expulsion from the republic, only a few of them even accepted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and the United Kingdom to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was during the wars as a Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice German deployed to the Baltic Navy.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans followed him to teach them Czech.
"They believed that when he returned home, Czech would be suitable for them," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners living before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, did not expect to be removed from the republic on the basis of Bene<0xC5><0xA1> decrees.
You don't think - you'll pay!
An emotional campaign will attack the driver
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
Even so, it could be characterized by an emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek promises to discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The campaign for 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, the Internet, but also on the air.
It should discourage the driver from driving fast and drinking alcohol behind the wheel.
And also remind them to fasten them before they leave.
He wants to reach out to young drivers, bikers, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Mainly human stories that attack the emotions.
And this is evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
You don't think - you'll pay!
The word "you don't think" is written in capital letters in the épézetce.
And in a pool of blood, there's the word "you pay."
This is to symbolize that a person can pay with his own life in a moment of inattention.
Spectators will "fear" the spots until 2010.
The ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic images of the victims of accidents can be commonly seen.
It promises to reduce accidents and the number of dead on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip on the driver
"The driver is covered by a system of sugar and whips.
Sugar for them is that if they go for red, for example, it saves time.
A whip is a threat of punishment or an accident.
Drivers must be reminded of the risk," says traffic psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n of Na Homolce Hospital.
That’s why we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, according to the psychologist.
Even less effective, according to him, are boards that warn drivers of danger.
"If a static hazard warning board is installed, it will probably merge with the surrounding area soon and drivers will not pay attention to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n said.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli interim Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has called for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview that was published by the Jediot Achronot newspaper on Monday.
“We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all (occupied) territory, if not all, will have to be returned,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage [of Israeli territory] because without it there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that a possible return would include East Jerusalem.
"Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and especially does not want tractors or bulldozers to cross his legs, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in a note of two July attacks in the city, in which dozens of people were killed.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a "special solution for the Temple Mount, sacred and historical places" that lie inside the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won’t work,” he added.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also expressed support for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was an indispensable condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to make peace with Syria solely on the basis of leaving the Golan," he said.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to win the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with (Shiite) Hezbollah; they will have to give up the continued support they provide to (Shiite) Hamas, (Terrorist Network) Al-Qaeda and Jihad (Sacred in Islam).
Questions after the accident: Are the stewards on the bus illegal?
The law does not know, walking on a long-distance bus is not allowed
In connection with the tragic accident of a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose as to whether stewards and passengers can travel by bus.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the steward is contrary to the law on road traffic," said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The crash that killed a 22-year-old stewardess last week appears to have been caused by a truck driver crossing the road on the bus.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver, in the least safe place in the car, although she reserved two more seats.
However, the bus can crash or brake sharply, even when the steward delivers a coffee or newspaper.
The role is whether the bus is equipped with parking spaces according to the technical license.
If it is not approved in the bus, the passenger must sit.
Student Agency long-distance buses do not have a place to stand; this is confirmed by Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz company director Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura.
"We discussed this with the ministry and at first did not allow the movement of passengers.
They later called it off and we got to the point where passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have their own seat," he said.
Steward's law doesn't know
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the steward role - no legislation addresses this role.
However, no legal regulation even prohibits carriers from providing services.
The law on road transport knows only the term of the guide vehicle; it does not define its rights and obligations," adds Hanzelka's spokesman.
On the contrary, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, director of the Department of Road Vehicles of the Ministry of Transport, believes that the law treats the issue sufficiently.
"It depends on whether the bus has a parking space in the approval.
It ends there," he says.
Buses are divided into city buses with parking spaces and limited maximum speed, intercity buses with parking spaces with higher permitted speed, and long-distance buses without parking spaces with the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says expert
The BESIP expert on traffic safety Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n does not see a fundamental problem in the movement of the stewards on board the bus.
“With smooth driving, there is not much danger, the situation can be compared to service in aircraft.
Even here it is not certain when the turbulence will come and the flight attendant can hit his head."
"But if the bus were to brake sharply, of course, the physical laws apply.
Just like on a city bus or a tram.
The security of the stewards must be addressed by the carrier by internal regulations," he says, and he also means that the issue is unresolved from the point of view of the law.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is willing to cancel the service
Student Agency offers the services of stewards as the only bus carrier.
It employs two hundred of them.
Even after an accident, the manager does not consider their profession to be risky.
"But as soon as I get the impression that the stewards' profession is risky, I will cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers are available upon arrival.
It would also save costs,” he says.
As an interest in safety, he justified the absence of stewards in his cars, the director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who operates a fraction of the lines compared to SA.
"We don't have a stewardess, we've been against that from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
There has been an immense tragedy
A young flight attendant from Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who worked for the company for two years, died in a traffic accident on the line to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably ran out without using a guide from the parking lane and blocked the way of the bus.
His driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but he was distracted by the right front.
That two places reserved for the rest of the stewards would be sold out, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura refuses.
"These places cannot be booked for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation of the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court, but expects financial compensation from the guilty party.
Amending the law?
In non-observance
The clarification of the movement of the stewards on board the bus could be brought by the amendment of the law, on which over a year the thirty-member expert group of the Ministry of Transport is working.
“There was no specific conclusion, of course.
Buses do not solve much, rather the point system, the maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones when driving," says expert Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards to be something that would fundamentally endanger the safety of passengers," Hanzelka concludes, adding that the control of the safety of buses is the responsibility of the police and labor safety authorities.
D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf's hope is Frankfurt
There is no shortage of great words in the WestLB Board of Directors’ letter to the staff of this bank.
By merging the units of this D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf money institution with Frankfurt’s Deka-Bank, the “central financial institution of the savings group for trading in capital markets” will be created, according to a letter sent to the public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will enter in this transaction a "set of competencies" ensuring long-term returns.
And it is said that such a connection can be a decisive impulse for further associations in the sector of national banks.
Such texts arise when the Board of Directors wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only from the European Commission, but also from the Federal Office for the Supervision of Financial Services, whose communication to the Land Government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
However, the connection between Deka-Bank, which customers are well aware of for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, has been talked about for a long time - even on the Frankfurt side.
Franz Waas, the head of Deka-Bank, said at the presentation of the half-yearly results at the end of August that the merger of his bank house from Mainzer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e with one of the country’s banks, such as Helaba or WestLB, makes no sense.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which is backed by one half of the Land Bank and the other of the Savings Bank, has mandated the Board of Directors to conduct talks with WestLB on joint business activities.
This could be capital market trades or a part of them.
However, the talks have only just begun, the financiers point out.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3,000 employees belongs to the most important employers in the financial market in Frankfurt, is not talking for the first time in connection with consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed that a merger of Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba could take place.
At the end of the day, there was nothing out of this triangle.
Shortly after the plans for the merger were made public, the Hessian Land Government opposed the participation of Helaba Bank.
Neither of the other bank houses were connected.
Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead acquired Landesbank Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg from Stuttgart.
Nevertheless, speculation has repeatedly surfaced about the connection of Deka-Bank with the land banks.
Recently, however, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Merl, chairman of the board of Helaba Bank, spoke negatively about the speculation about the merger of his finance house with others.
However, it seems that regardless of this, there is a growing belief that the convergence of different banking houses of the public sector is a necessity.
Now, after the elections to the Landtag in Bavaria, BayernLB’s connection with Landesbank Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg could be the first to begin.
This is not good news for Helabu.
If the pressure on further mergers should increase, then there is a gradual loss of potential partners for such mergers.
In the south, she would play only the second violin, despite the fact that the financial crisis so far faces significantly better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
At the beginning of the year, the Hessen-Th<0xC3><0xBC>ringen Savings and Bank Association, which holds an eighty-five percent stake in Helab, banned the connection with WestLB.
This is what Nord LB would look like.
However, geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, it is a question of how much the business models of individual institutions fit together.
In June, Merl said that the crucial question of what business model should ensure the future competitiveness of the country’s banks had not yet been answered by the German Union of Savings and Gryffindor Banks.
Everything could also end with the WestLB distribution, which, of course, no one wants in this institution.
Therefore, the letter of the board of directors there also speaks about the fact that it is trying to "comprehensive solution" for the entire bank house.
Whether and how it will be possible to connect individual components with Deka-Bank will show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend with Italy"
It's the first time for Elena, it's the third or fourth time for Luca.
But this time Elena will be his girlfriend, and so it will be different, he says.
Behind them, at the five-liter Kaiser barrel, stands a stronger beard and two hundred tourists at the Oktoberfest prove how deep the tones can release his throat.
Elena slaps Luc first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus parking next to Puorta Nuova station, four buses will depart this evening at 23.45 with the designation "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival at 6.30.
Three buses are occupied mainly by Italians, in one bus only Brazilians travel.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing with their flag, they were already celebrating at night.
And so out loud, says Marco Guarda, it's nothing for Italy.
Marco, wearing a long coat with a lining made of imitation fur and glasses with wide silver rings, belongs to these three buses.
He has been going to Oktoberfest with them for five years now, and this year alone he has organized three expeditions.
At night there, during the day between the stands with beer, at 22.30 departure back.
Spending the night would be an unnecessary expense, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros including a welcome drink with Kaiser beer, brewed exactly according to the Bavarian Beer Purity Act, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco went to Frankfurt for a language course.
Buses leave at night, following the motorway towards "Brennero".
No beer, not yet.
The bus is silent and the passengers are asleep.
They are doing well, they will still need their strength.
It takes place in Brixen and in Holzkirchen, where a lot of other buses with an Italian license plate make one more break on the number 8 motorway in front of Munich.
When Marco’s group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 7:30 a.m., there are about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco has the last speech, explains the plan of attack.
First of all, wear a yellow hat.
On the left is the inscription "Oktoberfest", next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the door to the beer tent opens, run!" Marco calls into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and occupy the seats at the back of the tent.
"Not forward, so that you do not obstruct, and not all the yellow hats on the same bench, spread around the space!"
It costs <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8, 25 cents.
And don't forget the props.
"Show the security guards that we're behaving decently.
As soon as you leave your seats, they're gone!"
Thirdly, "Tonight at exactly half past eleven, be here again!" Do you understand?
And up to Wiesn, a space with beer tents.
Along the way, a member of the group hangs yellow hats as badges on trees, signs and even on an election poster of one of the major Bavarian parties.
We need to prepare for a retreat.
The "weekend with Italy" is the second weekend of Oktoberfest.
There is no precise data on the number of visitors; it is said that fifty thousand of those who go on a trip through the Alps and enter the beer tents, ten percent of all visitors this weekend arrived from Italy.
The Munich police force will be reinforced by seven police officers from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which keeps national statistics, in which the Italians face the British (about 60 interventions) and the Austrians (about 80) with about 200 first medical treatments.
Especially popular among Italians is the Hofbr<0xC3><0xA4>u tent.
Sleepless Nights for Creditors Hypo Real Estate
Last week, Federal Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this policy has used the word "relatively" and the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared from the crisis has also been implicated in its claim.
Because it happened last weekend.
The Dax index tracks a financial house specializing in financing real estate Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will receive from a consortium of German banks a loan in the amount of several billion to protect against turbulence in the markets.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the credit assistance will go up to 35 billion euros.
The interest will have to be paid by Hypo Real Estate (HRE) only from the amount actually exhausted.
The money is said to come from private and public-law banks.
In the background are the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
This state financier, according to a newspaper report on long-term projects for which he lent money, refinanced himself in the extremely short term, which is no longer possible due to mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserve shrank by 95 % to EUR 2.37 million, and its equity ratio also slightly decreased from 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
Ordinary and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to the previous year, income from the increased value of receivables and certain securities as well as from the cancellation of reserves for credit trading fell by more than 70 percent to EUR 5 million.
It was only due to higher revenues from the compensation for the subsequent accounting costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the interest compensation under the tax regime and from the mediation of the business for the group companies that the decrease of 16 % on the revenue side was still moderate.
The former state financier, after its privatization in 1990, burned down on mortgages for tradesmen, which were then excluded from the portfolio of services and further managed by Aareal Bank.
As there was too little profit in classical state financing, Depfa became more involved in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects between private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
From the value of its subsidiary, Hypo Real Estate must now write something off, and these write-offs will have a "fundamental material effect" on the calculation of the profit and loss of the entire group, as some have been uncertainly heard.
The fact is, there will be no dividends.
In 2007, it was cut by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects since the acquisition of Depfa.
Stronger than other institutions depend on refinancing in the interbank market because it has no deposits from customers.
After the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, a source of interbank loans virtually dried up because banks are guarding their liquidity.
Every year, Hypo Real Estate needs short-term refinancing funds for part of the loan portfolio of Depfa - about 50 billion euros.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financial need is covered by this loan for a foreseeable period of time, and the company is protected “from the influence of international money markets currently to a significant extent incapacitated functions”.
Other sources have said that this money will ensure refinancing by the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to take advantage of the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Institute for the Supervision of Financial Services (BaFin) assume that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group in the market is now ensured.
This is what the shareholders and creditors of the bank hope.
But given the dynamics and inconsistency of the crisis, there is probably no certainty.
It is not even completely excluded that the loan should not be completely exhausted.
However, the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the bank seems to have been facing insolvency late on Sunday afternoon, the rescue, though preliminary, cannot calm the passions.
The share price fell by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
On the contrary, bond rates were well maintained.
While preferential debt has remained virtually unchanged, secondary bond rates are losing more significantly.
This applies in particular to bonds of the former W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg Hypo subsidiary and, logically, to bonds with a maturity beyond 2009.
The Hypo-Real-Estate bonds originally looked like an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability needs to be understood after the banking crisis and the crisis of the institute itself, which brought it into the company by taking over Deffa, depending on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and less-affected commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to count on the payment of securities within their due date.
But there may also be something that almost no one dares to hope for at the moment - the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in view of the reports coming at the same time as this partial nationalisation, the only legitimate hope has now become, from a probability bordering on certainty.
This, especially for long-term creditors, is likely to prepare a number of sleepless nights for them to decide whether to give up on their commitments.
Short-term investors may use the threshold line at least to create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to exchange rate returns in later years for the purpose of future payment of capital gains tax.
Sylvana and the secrets of the bento box
When sixteen-year-old Sylvana Hiltropova has her first day in high school in Taqibana, the girls start to brag: the German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows this word from the manga. On her new blog about the exchange stay, she talks about Japan.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I've already been on my way to school.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and drive 40 minutes by train to the middle of Tachibana.
I had to find my own way, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in Taqibana is not given as strictly as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin to meet after eight o'clock and twenty minutes before nine begins a short session with the teacher, the so-called 'home room'.
But before I started teaching, I had to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to talk in front of people, let alone 40 students in front of class.
Because I didn’t have a school uniform yet, I put on my host mom’s old skirt, plus a blouse, blue underpants and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the bench and tried to say everything correctly: 'Saj<0xC3><0xB3>nara Wo <0xC5><0xA1> Sylvana...' - my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I have a birthday in a week.
At that point, I was very happy that I started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering, whining and waving, and I kept hearing the word 'kawaii'.
I knew that from my manga.
It is one of the basic vocabulary of Japanese girls necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly moved into my place.
The girl next to me smiled quite broadly, considering it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the hour was quite quiet, but when the gong came, they literally put me to sleep.
They talked one over the other and chuckled and asked me about the possible and the impossible – and yet it’s really hard to understand Japanese English.
At the break, everyone unpacked their pennies.
My host mom also made me such a lunch box - and that's something other than boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small pairs, cucumber salad and algae, fruit and some fish in tofu dough.
I don’t know what I’m eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
Of course, everything is really good.
Well, except for the salt-laden plums, br!
Benta in Japanese schools is not just lunch.
Sometimes it happens that the girl gives the boy a hand-made bento, which in this case is especially artistically adapted, and hopes that the boy will get to know more about the break at the snack.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here too.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
Then I always said:
'Cause it just fascinates me.'
After all, I’ve loved reading manga for years.
And to better understand these comics and their culture, I started to learn some Japanese once.
It was clear to me that I would have to come here one day.
Because I also have a weakness for tradition, customs and habits.
And they are highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I’ve never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen.”
Even rats have feelings.
When a rat or a cockroach flees from danger, does that mean they also feel fear?
Neurologist Joseph LeDoux is convinced that even many animals have feelings.
But how would it be possible to verify whether they feel the same when they behave like us?
In the online magazine "Edge" for several years, contributions of well-known scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in its series presents selected answers to the question "What do you consider to be true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, when we cannot prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case we can at least hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
However, as soon as we begin to engage in a different kind and open up questions of perception or general consciousness, we enter the impassable terrain because the hardware does not match.
When a rat gets into danger, it will do the same thing as many other animals: pretend to be dead, flee or attack.
Humans behave in a similar way, from which some scientists suggest a comparable subjective experience.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to the experience of animals.
This is because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always include the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its share of short-term memory and executive or control functions).
This vast area is much more developed in humans than in other primates, and seems to be completely lacking in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, among them the knowledge of who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, there is reason to believe that man is different from even other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity could be hidden by the language essence of man: because so much of his perception is associated with language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could exclude animals.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, language would certainly influence it, so that animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably differ from most states of our consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to find out what consciousness looks like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it can neither be measured nor analyzed on the basis of our own experience, due to special hardware, its exploration puts us in front of great problems.
Most of my findings relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be more scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to study processes in the consciousness of animals regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially on the example of visualization.
But this approach, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick focused on, focuses more on the neural correlates of consciousness than on the causal mechanisms: both may be identical, but they may not be.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the non-frontal cortex for the realization of visualization.
What does that mean for feelings?
I derive them from the fact that an emotional system, such as a fear system, is activated in the brain by conscious self-activity.
What we call “fear,” then, is the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of a defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) takes advantage of the operating memory.
Seen from this angle, the sensations are closely associated with those areas of the cortex that are characterized by primates, and especially humans.
In connection with language nature, there is a subtle degradation of perception, because with the help of words and grammar, we can distinguish and categorize states in order to attribute them to each other and to others.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortex and brain stem devoted to bodily sensations, much like Jaak Pankseep, who focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, it could easily participate in the feelings perceived by several animal genera.
In theory, I can't argue with that, but I think it's unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what we think of as fear in rats and humans is likely to be felt by both organisms in the same way: But how is it possible to verify, Pankseep goes on to say, whether rats and humans feel the same when they behave similarly?
The cockroach flees from danger - does he also feel fear?
From my point of view, the mere similarity of behavior cannot prove the consistency of experience.
It is true that the neural comparison moves us further: rats and humans have similar brain strains, in contrast to cockroaches and brains.
But is the brain stem responsible for feelings?
And even if it were possible to prove it in humans: how would we want to prove it in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?), have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I’d rather explore emotional behavior than emotional perception of rats.
In any case, in this case, we can expect to see progress at the neural level if we measure the same thing in rats and humans.
Like rats, I don’t examine language and consciousness, I don’t even examine feelings, because I don’t know if they exist.
It is possible to consider it short-sighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than repeatedly throwing myself against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
President of UEFA Platini: A grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vasjunyk said that preparations will soon be led directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as proof of trust in Ukraine and its ability to organise ME together with Poland," Vasjunyk said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot of work to be done in both countries.”
In the early implementation of the schedule of construction or reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports, both hosts are applauding.
It is even possible that the number of stadiums for the ME will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste time anymore.
We must now work as quickly as possible," Ukrainian Union President Grigory Surkis said.
"UEFA will be watching us all the time."
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the leadership of the Polish PZPN was dismissed by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlock.
The Committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miros<0xC5><0x82>aw Drzewieck<0xC3><0xBD>.
There is a "serious danger that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"We have written to UEFA President Michel Platini to assure him that preparations for the UEFA European Championship 2012 will not be tolerated with this step."
Several teams from the first league were sentenced to forced downs only last season due to manipulations, eventually having to be even abruptly moved to the start of the league.
Dennis Quaid is back in action
She wanted to make an ad for a new movie, she talked about private things — and now she’s having trouble with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her ex-Denise Quaid as a swindler of marriage.
He's furious and he's coming back.
The late war of roses in the former married couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after the divorce, these two Hollywood actors lead a nasty argument - in front of the public eye.
In an interview with American magazine InStyle last week, Ryan said for the first time about the reasons for the breakdown of her marriage: "Dennis was unfaithful to me for a long time, and it was very painful."
It was not until after the divorce that she learned about the extent of the fraud.
The inspiration for this mental striptease was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - it tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was stark: “It’s crazy,” the 45-year-old actor told the New York Daily News that “Meg repeatedly chews up the history of our relationship and edits it.”
In addition, it is "regrettable" that the joint sixteen-year-old son Jack once again "publicly recalls the pain and radical changes that divorce is for every child."
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently became the father of twins.
He concludes his reflections on avoidance by saying, “My life goes on anyway.
I think I’m lucky to have an amazing family that is doing great.”
Prices of flights and hotels are falling
In the first half of 2008, flights and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to one current study, flights were even cheaper by up to 50 percent.
Flights and hotel accommodation have again been discounted - this is the result of a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its data on bookings made in the first half of 2008 and, after price increases in the first quarter, found a significant drop in bookings made in the second quarter.
After several years of rising prices in the hotel market, accommodation in many places has already become cheaper.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities monitored increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The most visible was this trend in Paris and Rome, where passengers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
The reason for this trend is considered by American Express to be a weak dollar exchange rate, which has caused "the declining appetite of American tourists to travel".
The fall in hotel prices was also more affected by financial centres than industrial centres such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices have even set a European record with an increase of 26.3 percent.
Ticket prices also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
Due to the price of kerosene, Economy class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, fuel-intensive long-haul flights even cost up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, fares in the Economy class fell by an average of 12.5 percent compared to the previous quarter, but changes in the Business and First-Class classes were less significant.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, they increased by 11.9 percent, in the second quarter they decreased by 23.6 percent.
In the German domestic years, according to the cited study, prices even halved.
One of the reasons for this price drop is slowing economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, due to the Open Skies agreement, which liberalized air traffic between the US and Europe, there is increased competitive pressure.
A sign of the tense situation is the disruption of unprofitable lines by airlines, as well as a high number of airlines that declared bankruptcy in the first half of 2008 - in Europe alone there were 24 airlines.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1:0
With one edge and simple methods, the Hamburger SV gets to the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay is no longer able to assemble a functioning eleven.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - increase Unsuccessful landing for representative Marko Marina.
This player from Gladbach got involved in the game too late and failed to score a ball.
His report was precisely worded, and it sounded convincingly out of his mouth.
He simply knew he was right.
'We need a second goal, 'said Hermann Rieger in the hallway of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break between half-times ended and most people sat in their seats again.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for nearly three decades and enjoys more respect than many momentary actors.
And so his request was also heard in a responsible place.
Coach Cornelius Jol's assistant pulled up and raised his finger to the sign of agreement.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jola.
His order was probably similar: here with the other goal!
It didn't happen.
"It didn't look good in here today," Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have liked it "more relaxed".
For 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburgers owe the header to Mladen Petri<0xC4><0x87> (11th) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladba<0xC5><0xA1>ana could not hurt the weak Hamburgers.
'It was a dirty victory, 'said Martin Jol.
This Monday, Hamburger SV will celebrate 121 years of its existence.
On Saturday afternoon, the spectators celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arena and a live updated table on the video wall, in which their team was presented as a prize winner.
It's gonna be a birthday without a big party.
"We know how to evaluate it," Marcell Jansen said.
He suspects that the continuous scoreboard symbolizes the uncountability of the league rather than the dominance of its HSV.
The team with the late arrival of new players - Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petri<0xC4><0x87> and from FC Bayern won by Jansen - is slowly but still unable to shine.
"We need more feeling and more dribbling," Jol said emphatically.
After the defeat in the vote
There is fear on Wall Street.
The first reports of the sinking of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones index to drop by up to 700 points.
That was the biggest point loss in one day in his history.
Later, Dow picked up something again.
At around 8.30 p.m., the world’s most important stock market barometer showed a five percent drop to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was more than seven percent down at 1,548 points.
The worst was in Dow at this point American Express, which lost almost 14 percent, and Bank of America losing about 12 percent.
None of the titles could be improved.
Goldman Sachs lost nearly 10 percent of its shares.
Just a few days ago, Warren Buffett, a major investor, had a stake in the company.
As part of the rescue plan, funds are to be made available for the purchase of so-called damaged mortgage papers.
However, the entire amount is not to be paid at once, but in several stages.
In return, the state should receive stock options of financial companies, which could be repaid in a favorable course development, thereby reducing the burden on the state budget.
Stock prices in Europe are falling sharply
Billions of dollars in aid to banks in Europe and the United States do not leave investors in doubt.
The share price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly down and the Dax index is being downloaded with it.
The U.S. Dow Jones index is losing despite the state’s planned bailout of the financial market.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank toppled the German stock index (Dax) deep into the minus.
Despite a rescue by the federal government and private banks, Commerzbank lost up to three-quarters of its value by more than 20 percent.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6,000-point mark and scored 5,839 points with a minus 3.7 percent.
Stock markets around the world are on their knees.
In New York City, the business day on Wall Street began with significant losses.
Investors fear that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package may not be enough to revive the financial markets.
During the first hour of trading, the Dow lost 334 points, or 3.3 percent, to 10,809.25.
The U.S. House of Representatives is due to vote on a bailout plan, the Senate could speak on Oct. 1.
The other European stock exchanges were also moving in only one direction: in London, the FTSE index first weakened by 3.2 percent, while the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s Nikkei index fell by 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 units after initial gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.

In MDAX, they lost Arcandor’s share capital after the announcement.
Private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed 23 million new shares.
The business and tourism group also said it would not sell its stake in Thomas Cook.
Dark Matter Affects the Flight of Space Probes
For years, scientists have not been able to cope with one mysterious phenomenon: dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver (gravitational prak).
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity might not be entirely correct.
For almost 18 years, the spacecraft "Ulysses" flew in space.
The fuel lines, which will soon freeze, are now threatening to kill her in the winter.
For years, one mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion among scientists - the anomaly of the gravitational pull.
Gravitational Prak is an aerial maneuver of space probes, in which they acquire additional motion in the gravitational field of a space body, for example, the Earth.
This allows the probes to save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens research probe used this physical trick as well as the Ulysses solar probe.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case is surprising: flying bodies do not behave 100 percent as one would expect under the old good law of gravity.
On the contrary, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes accelerate or slow down unexpectedly.
So far, physicists have failed to explain this effect.
He was baptized by an anomaly of gravity.
Several experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by the curvature of space, might not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton is still convinced that Einstein was not wrong, and is trying to explain the anomaly of the gravitational pull using so-called dark matter, the presence of which has been discovered in space by astronomers.
"A dark matter could be responsible for this anomaly, which could also be very close to Earth," he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known by space researchers for about ten years.
It is based on the apparent gravitational force, the effect of which on other cosmic bodies can be observed.
On the contrary, it is completely invisible, which means that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, not even visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, about one-fifth of the total mass of the universe is made of this dark matter.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are at large
After ten days in the hands of their captors, according to a statement by the Italian foreign minister in Egypt, tourists are kidnapped again in freedom.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six kidnappers were reportedly killed in the pre-release shooting.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The ransom negotiations are already underway.
The Germans have repeatedly become the target of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists in the Sahara are apparently free.
Egyptian state television, Arab Al-Arabiya television station and Italian media reported the same.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, according to reports by Italian television station Sky TG 24, confirmed: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are currently verifying their health status," Frattini said.
According to an Egyptian state television report, five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian guides, are safe and sound.
All 19 participants of the expedition to the desert are already on their way to Cairo.
It remains unclear the background of the shooting before the hostages were released: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army surprisingly killed six of the kidnappers.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed with the ransom,” the employee said.
He said "it was just a hostage takeover" when "this surprise" suddenly came to an end.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt shot six hijackers and captured two of them.
The kidnappers asked Germany for a ransom of six million euros; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper El Masri El Jom, citing one of the German intermediaries, said the release of the hostages was delayed because the kidnappers feared for their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers wanted to release the hostages of the female sex after paying the ransom.
The men should be held until the kidnappers have a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse of a father "leads to suicide"
Several years of abuse by her father led her to kill herself, and she was heard in court.
After acknowledging eight cases of sexual harassment, Michael Trerise, 75, of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years in prison.
The Truro Crown Court heard that he had regularly tied his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between the ages of five and seven.
"I feel responsible for her death," Trerise wrote in confession.
The court also said Ms. Randle killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child living in Coventry, Trerise blindfolded her and sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
However, it was heard before the court that Ms. Randle, who had spent a substantial portion of her time as a volunteer for the National Trust organization, was haunted by a ghost of abuse that was committed on her twice a week.
The plaintiff Ramsey Quaife told the court that in 2006 the friends of Ms. Randle, who was also heavily involved in surfing and cycling, said she was "emotionally dead" and that she "gave up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
She is thought to have suffocated with a needle bag.
Randle stood face to face with his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words: "I bound her and bound her eyes.
"I didn't abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen Treris said: “You are an extremely strange fetishist and it must have been horrible for your victim when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking her own life.
Even worse is the fact that if she had not done so, the case would probably not have been brought to court at all.”
"I would particularly like to highlight the consequences that your crime against their daughter over the years has had, according to Stephanie's parents," he added.
"Obviously, she'd probably be a promising, successful and happy young woman."
The person who lost the data will be charged.
The BBC has learned that a government official who left classified documents on the train in June will be charged under the State Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top-secret documents on a train in Waterloo at the time he was temporarily assigned to the Department of Defense.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least serious offence against the said law and nothing suggests a criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would come as a surprise to many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought it was an internal matter between the ministry and the government office," he said.
An employee who is not allowed to be appointed is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act in question, which is a clause that deals with the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecutor advised the Metropolitan Police to prosecute the officer on the basis of the very sensitive nature of his work in the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot included covert al-Qaeda analysis and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from his home to an unknown location.
B&Bs face a debt crisis
British cooperative reserves may have to settle more than <0xC2><0xA3>80 million in debt after the rescue of Bradford & Bingley Bank.
The government has provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to Bradford & Bingley clients to protect their deposits.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that accept client deposits, including 59 cooperative deposits.
Adrian Coles, director general of the BSA, said it was "humiliating" that the reserves and their members had to pay.
The $14 billion debt will eventually be repaid by bailing out the Bradford & Bingley mortgages.
However, the interest, which will be accrued in the meantime, will be paid each year to all 700 financial companies that accept client deposits.
The Fund's Compensation Plan for Money Services for the BBC has confirmed that all 59 cooperative foundations are accounted for in this figure.
It is humiliating that these institutions, which have behaved prudently... now have to pay off some of the accounts of those institutions which have not been so prudent by far.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company should pay in proportion to the deposits it held, and that reserves should pay about 18% of the price.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that interest on debt will increase to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that the reserves will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to repay the interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the cooperative foundations trade association, told the BBC he was convinced it was unfair.
“It is humiliating that those institutions that behaved prudently during the housing market boom now have to pay off some of the accounts of those institutions that were far from so prudent.”
According to the BSA, no reserves have fallen since they appeared in 1945.
"We'll have to look at all aspects of the matter over the next few weeks to see what options there are to protect the reserve fund and its members from an account that could be substantial," Cole said.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September to the end of March.
In 2010 there will be interest payments for the whole year and that could be almost twice as much.
Since cooperative reserves are shareholdings without shareholders, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk will cost five pence per litre
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
Jersey Dairy announced Monday that it will increase the wholesale price of its milk by five pence per litre.
This is the second price increase this year, after a double price increase in February, and comes after research conducted by the consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to reflect the price tag in customer prices.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price of milk from Jersey last changed in 2002.
The bail for Bangladeshi expatriate was rejected.
A Bangladeshi court has rejected a request by former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Vajid for bail, meaning that if she returns to her homeland, she could be arrested.
Her lawyers said the court refused to release her on bail in connection with the allegation that she obtained over fifty million taka ($729,700) from a certain businessman when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges brought against her.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>lida Zijaov<0xC3><0xA1>, a long-time political rival of Shaykh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh within the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that a local army-held government give her complete freedom first.
The correspondents say that while she was released on parole in order to undergo a medical procedure abroad, it is not clear under the terms of her release whether she will remain at large until she returns to Bangladesh.
Its lawyers say it will now appeal to the Supreme Court against the Supreme Court’s order.
"The Supreme Court has rejected Shaikh Hasina's request for bail, stating that she does not need bail when she is already undergoing an examination abroad for an honorary statement," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the Supreme Court's order."
Her lawyers said she needed bail to be able to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December election.
A senior member of the League of Nations said Shaykh Hasin should return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the army-held interim government took power, but was released from prison in June so she could go abroad for medical treatment.
Shaykh Hasin and Khalid Zia both deny all the charges against them.
Fears of vaccination against measles in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children have not participated in the recent mass vaccination against measles due to Taliban-linked violence.
The United Nations last week carried out vaccinations in six provinces.
However, she says she could not reach children in the south in Helmand and Kandahar for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said that despite the Taliban’s promises, it will not attack or deter thousands of vaccine workers at work.
BSkyB lost a court dispute over ITV
BSkyB lost the legal dispute over the review of the Commission’s decision on competition, which ordered the company to reduce its share in the competitive broadcasting company ITV.
The Court of Appeal for Competition of BSkyB ordered it to reduce its share of ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB’s share was anticompetitive and had a disproportionate impact on ITV.
BSkyB bought a stake in 2006 in a store that as a result prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office for Fair Trade announced that BSkyB's acquisition of its stake in ITV had given rise to doubts about ITV's independence and called on the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
The head of the Virgin consortium Sir Richard Branson, the consumer organization and the regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its stake in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution – mainly because BSkyB had previously said it was willing to give up its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. lawyer's affair
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
Tah came in a situation when the report of the affair prepared by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice criticized the activities of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, legislators and former justice minister Albert Gonzalez.
The investigation was prompted by concerns that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Counsel Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials at the hearings lied to investigators in order to pursue justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in a statement: “Serious allegations, including potential criminal activity, have not been fully investigated or explained.”
The appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
The dispute began when the U.S. Department of Justice stripped nine U.S. attorneys of their duties in December 2006.
At the time, the ministry said the lawyers had been released due to poor performance.
However, it later turned out that the release of the lawyers was not rated any worse than many of their colleagues, which led many observers to conclude that the release was politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in prosecuting high-ranking Republican MPs and senators, while others refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against the Democrats.
U.S. attorneys are investigating and prosecuting cases for the government.
They may be released at any time, but may not be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, was fired and eventually resigned.
A number of other representatives of the Ministry of Justice also resigned.
The Inspector General’s report was very critical of Gonzales’s role in the affair, saying he was “mainly responsible” for the dismissal, that he “abdicated” from his leadership position and was “remarkably not involved in the action.”
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating in the investigation.
Meat Loaf’s masterpiece to be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf will receive one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will attend the ceremony next weekend in London for his special gold award, said he was "honoured" by the recognition he received.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year’s nomination is led by Coldplay, which has been narrowed down to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said: “There are some songs that stand out over things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is definitely one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed great vocals provided by Meat Loaf.
It began with an instrumental part that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single and peaked at number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell has been on the charts for about nine years and has sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - suffered from health problems in recent years, and in 2003 he was operated on due to an irregular heart rhythm after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
Later it turned out that he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
Obscure streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
The city of New York has thousands of roads, streets, highways and other land transportation, some famous, others just useful.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime locals have difficulty finding Extra Place, mostly because they’ve never heard of it.
This little street is in the East Village and leads north from First Street - without getting to Second Street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At a width of about ten and a length of forty meters, it is more like a dusty passage than a traffic lane.
There are no signs with street names.
In the normal atlas, it is practically invisible.
However, the street has an admirer.
For example, Avalon Bay, a developer of recently built luxury buildings on First Street.
He wants to renovate Extra Place and create a cleaner passageway to the shops and boutiques that are to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers are longtime neighbors who say they were charmed by the truncated alleyway simply because it was one of the last remnants of the time before the block was affixed.
However, the city’s Office for the Protection and Development of Construction, which has the street in its power, has no vested interest in sticking to it.
At the meeting of the community land committee, representatives of the city office and Avalon Bay company planned a plan according to which the developer should buy the street.
However, according to Susan Stetzer, district manager of the Municipal Community 3, the committee prefers such a variant, when the street will remain in the hands of the city, and asked for a new plan, which should be submitted next month.
"The city already owns very few land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its ownership," she said.
“There could be suggestions for repair and management, which Avalon could do, but we also want to guarantee public access.”
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it wants to renovate a small street and set up seating, several of which would be used by a cafe, whose interest in renting the space is expected by the developer.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first published at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay spokeswoman, said that although the company wants to use the street, it does not necessarily want to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s main intention is to fix this deserted street and make it a beautiful place for the public,” she said, adding that the sale had proposed the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Building Preservation Office, said the city really wanted to sell the street, noting that the job of his office was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow mark on history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorna's large farm was divided among several of his children and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The back door to the Extra Place was led by CBGB, a punk rock monument that closed in 2006, and the street is perhaps best known as the background to the photo on the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia".
"The place was amazing," says Danny Fields, manager of the Ramones, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes."
Some locals, including bloggers who write about grooming the East Village neighborhood, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place and argue that that piece of public property, though modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place to be a rarity - an almost unchanged part of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah's Disappearing New York (subtitled "The Book of Lamentations: A bitterly nostalgic view of the city in the process of extinction"), penned part of the Extra Place story from Talk About the City, which appeared in The New Yorker newspaper in 1952.
The author of the article, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow blind alley, dark even in the daytime and bordered by rusty iron warehouse doors and clogged windows, where a week's worth of old newspapers are chased in the straws."
With a few exceptions, the street of one recent evening looked exactly the same.
The rat passed through the blind end of the street near the door that once led to the CBGB, where today stands a store of expensive clothing.
There was graffiti on the walls and next to the fresh dose of discarded newspapers lay an empty bottle of beer.
A couple of passers-by said they rarely thought of Extra Place, but suggested that it might be worth some effort.
Fields, on the other hand, said he thinks some people underestimate the street’s appeal in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "were in places of darkness, dampness, and disgust."
The Bilingualism Debate: Immersion in English
In this issue of Focused on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the attitudes of candidates to bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a Californian academic and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of “Borse Than You Think: Why Middle Class Needs Schools.”
Effectively addressing Hispanic voters is a sham business.
Barack Obama’s education agenda is proof of that.
Obama’s campaign notes that “African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to study than white students,” which is true.
In order to combat such performance differences, Obama’s education agenda specifically advocates, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for those who are just learning English.
The question, however, remains whether Barack Obama’s commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is stronger than his interest in reducing performance differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in East Los Angeles County.
The students of this school are, in the vast majority of cases, Hispanics from low-income families.
More than a third of students, many of whom have only recently arrived, are still learning English.
Nevertheless, in the state tests of mathematics in 2008, it reached the highest level of an incredible hundred percent of fourth-grade students.
Almost equally amazing ninety-three percent of fourth-grade students reached the highest level in state tests of English language and literature.
This incredible success has been achieved by a different method than Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of abilities, and unexplainable approach.
Further, and Obama should note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s pedagogical approach for those who are just learning English is “complete immersion.”
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in teaching.
Ms. Mikels, who is opposed to bilingual education, told me, “We had a tremendous success with one brand-new student from Mexico – after twelve months, you would enter the class and not know who it is.”
"It works," she said, "it works for us."
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as an example of what other schools with large shares of Hispanic and English-students should look like?
The results that the school achieves should make it obvious from the answer to this question, but the educational agenda of its own party (the National Education Association is a long-standing supporter of bilingual education) and its own consistent support of bilingual education make it unclear.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he has recently trivialized the matter by saying that people should stop worrying about “English-only” laws.
Instead, "you should make sure your children speak Spanish," he said.
If Obama really wants to erase performance differences, he should think more carefully about the educational patterns that work, rather than making fun of them and trivializing them.
Oil is falling sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid concerns that not even a U.S. bailout plan would have to revive the economy.
In the morning trading on the New York Commodity Exchange, the prices of oil futures fell by 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than twenty dollars per barrel.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by financial unrest on Wall Street and a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a maximum of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices fell to nearly $90 per barrel earlier this month, sparking a surge in financial market uncertainty.
Investors were once again gripped by anxiety on Monday, even after the Congressional presidency announced it had reached an agreement over the weekend on the biggest bailout plan in history.
This report was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis is far from over.
In the latest episode of the ongoing breakup, the government announced that Citigroup will buy Wachovia Corporation’s banking division.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially liquidated the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the frantic weekend talks that led to the plan to save the economy “showed to be unable to revive the market mood.”
As the economic situation worsens, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
“The outlook for global equities, interest rates and exchange rates has been severely eroded,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a report to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape the disease.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is the extent to which the U.S. virus will spread around the world and especially to China.”
Analysts at the bank lowered their expectations for next year as oil consumption fell due to slower economic growth, and lowered their 2009 gasoline price forecasts by about 20 percent.
The wild ride in the second quarter broke the team's record.
After spending more time in the Jets over the past eight seasons than anyone else, defensive player Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then on Sunday, he watched the development of the second quarter, in which the Jets turned a pointless game into a sleepy drive.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals faced the gloomy clouds above them with their troubled game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Colese on a twelve-yard touchdown sprint, making a perfect pre-recording in the afternoon, in which their gradually developing collaboration moved a mile ahead.
Favre sent Colese in this quarter for two more touchdowns, including the cornerback, and another 10 seconds before half-time.
"It wasn't anything special," Favre said of all his tackles to Coles.
"He's a damn good player.
We communicate well, no matter what people think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing, the defense attacked Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a stray shot and returned it 32 yards to the touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith typed another pass and captured it.
Linebacker David Bowens used Warner to fumble.
The last loss of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals got to the ball 10 seconds before the end, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a twenty-yard goal from the field, earning a lead of 34-0.
That's the most Jets have ever won in a quarter.
Coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "Second quarter or third quarter?"
When told that both - Jets allowed in the third quarter 21 points without an answer - Mangini said: "I can tell you that the second quarter I enjoyed much more than the third.
Many points fell in a short period of time.”
Gebreselassie has improved its world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why he is considered by many to be the best distance runner in the world when he broke his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and became the first person to race a 26.2-mile race under two hours and four minutes.
By winning on a pleasantly flat track in 2:03:59, he overcame his previous time of 2:04:26 by 27 seconds, which was held last year in Berlin.
The 35-year-old Gebreselassie has created the 26th world record of his career, which is truly incredibly wide - he has surpassed the world record or is at least a world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie skipped an Olympic marathon in Beijing because he was afraid – perhaps too scared in retrospect – that polluted air would upset his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - he won the Gebreselassie on Sunday with a lightning-fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
What track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya focused on on the longer track has dropped the marathon record in the past decade by more than two minutes, since Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's win, Gebreselassie told reporters he had a cramp in his lap two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
Apparently, the break was more of a wake-up call than a delay.
"I'm so happy," Gebreselassie told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little hesitant today, but everything was fine.”
He was also criticized - especially in Kenya, East Africa's rival Ethiopia - for allegedly over-planning his races, generally avoiding world marathon tops, relying on guides as if it were a race on track, and building world records over a sense of community.
But this criticism can hardly reduce Gebreselassie’s enormous running quality.
Maintained at the pace of four Kenyans, Gebreselassie reached half in time of 1:02:04.
After the guides fell away, Gebreselassie was constantly chased by two elite Kenyan runners James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
A little more than three miles before the goal, Gebreselassie last took and ran away to Kwambai, who then finished in second place at 2:05:36, improving his personal maximum by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third at 2:07:48.
In the women's race ended an excellent year with the seventh fastest time in history 2:19:19 Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan, who is now a citizen of Germany.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliff from the United Kingdom.
Sixty-three-year-old Mikit<0xC4><0x9B>nka surprisingly won last spring’s London Marathon in a time of 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games because of something described as a back injury, but recovered and won in Berlin, and in the third marathon she ever ran, she improved her personal maximum by almost five minutes.
She ran the race smartly and thoughtfully: she let the four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners run to a great advantage and then after about 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles she reached them.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
The Pride and Obstacles of Black Lives in a Separate City
Hidden among the sprawling amusement parks of Greater Orlando, a few miles from everything shiny, noisy and huge, lies a quiet city where the pride and sophistication of African-American life comes to life.
Eatonville, the first completely black city to be incorporated into the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: “the city of five lakes, three croquet courts, three hundred brown skins, three hundred good schools, and three hundred good floats.”
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee attended the annual Eatonville Festival Zora! to pay tribute to Hurston, the most famous female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The city she described remains a sideline, even though it has made it a tourist stop by including it in the Florida tourist guide created by the Federal Writers Project during the economic crisis.
It’s still as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted and didn’t share their true feelings with a white man who “knows so little about us that he doesn’t even know what he’s missing.”
Even today, in a year when the black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open debate about races, many of the people here remain wary of the views of foreigners.
“We pay close attention to how our story is told,” says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, who has lived here since birth and is a member of the city’s oldest parish.
"It must be right."
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It is both a historical model of the Black rise and a community of nearly 2,400 people, where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a center of literature, but also a shady example of southern rural black culture – sometimes despised, sometimes praised – that originated from American slavery.
It is not surprising that the people here are both proud and protective.
And concerns about Eatonville's idea really started with Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heart-wrenching books such as Mules and Men (1935) and Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937).
The five paragraphs of the Florida tour guide turned the city into road no. 17, which leads through the often overlooked center of Florida, into a stage of black history and human drama.
With the start of a big drum in life and literature, Hurston introduced readers to the shop of Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"To the left of the road," she wrote, "is a white, brownly decorated modern national school with well-maintained courtyards and playgrounds that Howard Miller always cares about, even though he can't read or write much."
She also mentioned Dash's widow's new husband, writing that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and anything that fits the hour hotel."
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government, but also with illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
This was obviously not typical of Fodor's publishing house.
In fact, it wasn’t a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora said it the way it was," says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson's girls who made Hurston immortal by citing men who sang downright songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it," she added.
Hurston is still remembered here as a chip-cutter who often returned after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-seven-year-old Augustus Franklin remembers that most of the time, when she came to town, she arrived unannounced in a huge Chevrolet, smoked, and wore pants in a city that is still proud of its dignified dress.
Most of the population was fascinated, Franklin said, but many were scolded.
"The people of Zora have always loved to see," Franklin said.
But, he added, he swings on a chair on the back terrace overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "never stayed too long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were cut from the press.
It seemed that Eatonville had forgotten about her along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major funerals or public readings in Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood either her significance to the world or her legacy at all," said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's 2003 biography Wrapped in Rainbows.
The change came in the 80s of the 20th century.
Orange County County officials wanted to extend the city by a five-lane highway instead of Kennedy Boulevard, a local two-lane highway.
Orland's ascent has already pushed Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was still receiving from a difficult historical period.
Forced integration, along with other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950s, the struggle to stir up racial hatred brought it to the forefront of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white guys, they came and threw oranges and things at people who were sitting on the sidelines," Franklin said.
"We actually had one lady here who killed it.
They were walking melon out of the car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court’s demand for forced integration and declared his decision in Brown’s case against the Board of Education to be “offensive rather than laudatory to my race.”
Residents now claim that desegregation of schools, while positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the local youth.
"Black kids were used to hugging - I remember that - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening," said N. Y. Nathriova, daughter of Elly Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
It lasted until the teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
"You're not embracing your white teacher because your white teacher -- I mean, there's a cultural barrier," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped to create space for many more Zora Neale Hurston - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, rose above prejudices with light-hearted self-confidence and quotes such as "How can anyone deny the pleasure of my presence!
I don't understand."
In 1975, Alice Walker arrived at Hurston's unmarked grave and began fighting to revive her reputation.
Five years later, a highly acclaimed biography of Robert E. Hemenway by Robert E. Hurston came to the shelves of bookstores, which again included her in the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter found the lights of the ramp again.
The former neighbors of Hurston now considered her a saviour.
To show what could happen to their highway, the community began planning the 1988 Hurston Festival.
Thousands of fans arrived for the inaugural event two years later, and many return to the celebration each January.
A few years later, the state withdrew from the highway proposal.
"The five currents of the highway have risen, you would say, directly ignited, real civic pride," Nathiri said.
Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped change the image of the city.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began attending the church here in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to reassess the past.
Eatonville joined the National Historical Register in 1998.
The new one-story library (named, of course, after Hurston) was opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando can sometimes seem like a dead end in summer rain, as small as when it was founded with only 27 black families in the 1980s.
(Ninety percent of them are black.)
With strangers coming to look for the story and meaning of Eatonville, it is still often treated with caution.
Permission for most interviews is required in advance and certain things – such as murals in the oldest Eatonville church painted by whites and depicting blacks in the fields – are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a brave, self-confident teacher who likes bright red, still fear that their isolated community will not be properly understood.
And even as the Hurston Festival grew, so did domestic pride.
Especially young people tend to see Eatonville the way Hurston saw her whole race: beautiful, troubled, and so on, but no better, no worse, and as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish, and diverse as any other American race and ethnic group.
The voice of Franklin’s nephew, eighteen-year-old Edwin Harvey, sounds like a sincere love for the village as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in a local government or police department he says would benefit from some help.
And even younger ones, such as eleven-year-old twins from Winter Park Alondra and Alexia Kenonova, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, when they're just passing through here, think, 'Hm, this town is nothing against the others,' " Alondra Kenon said recently Sunday after church.
"But if you really stop and look at history for a moment, it's a very nice city."
Here in New York, we're all talking gas.
At first glance, nothing has changed here.
If tourists in Manhattan had stayed away from the newsstands and the sprawling TV screens in Times Square, they would not have realized they were standing in the middle of a storm.
They would never guess that in the frozen bee hive of offices over their heads, every day the bankers and investment fund managers who monopolize New York have the worst “bad day in the office” since the 1929 crisis.
The senders are still carrying metal carts along the sidewalks and transporting muffin bakers to breakfast meetings.
The Spaniards still move among the turrets and wear, like human mussels, fifty ironed shirts hanging from the scales on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in the front for their morning bagel at street food stalls, and it is still not possible to get a yellow taxi on a day-to-day basis between the fourth and seventh afternoons.
It didn’t seem like a crisis at all until I decided, with all the pessimism I had to say, to set up a savings account on Thursday afternoon.
Despite the fact that I had timed this task to cover with a late afternoon nap at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, about twenty people were already waiting in the front line.
Not in front of the cash registers to pick up or store cash, but in front of the counter, where older customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's mixed-goods store, and new customers set up accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker," came from the same reason I did.
However, compared to me, they have already selected their savings from smaller banks in places where they came from, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania or Staten Island.
They picked money from so-called thrift houses (a little bit like building savings banks), money unions, and those types of savings banks whose branches operate only in one state, and which claim to take care of their customers as a family.
In the past year, 15 such banks have quietly collapsed.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with assets worth $327 billion, went into bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers returned home for the weekend on Friday evening, another bank, Wachovia, with assets worth $440 billion, tried to catch a rescue buyer.
The employees of the offices and shops who stood before me and were afraid of another collapse, moved their cash to a bank that is perceived as a safe haven and which makes most of the bailout on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned a lot in the past week.
A woman in my local Chinese supermarket spoke on the phone and spoke to Lehman Borthers, that bankrupt bank, and to her sluggish top executive Dick Fuld with such familiarity as if she were talking about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, a uniformed, roughly fifty-year-old native of my kennel, changed the subject of our ordinary conversation—Brad, Angelina, or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she told me: “I now have my savings in money market funds.
I've moved it, I won't risk it."
Muslim graves desecrated after Austria's right-wing break-up
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left, from the Austrian right-wing Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang, took part in a demonstration that presented in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008 the organization "Cities against Islamization".
They carry signs similar to traffic signs that show mosques crossed by a red line.
Police are accusing right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend that far-right parties made huge gains in the general election.
More than 90 graves in the cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were sometimes badly damaged between Friday night and this morning, and the police are convinced that it was an organized event.
The culprits sprayed Jewish symbols such as the Star of David onto some graves, but the detectives are convinced it could have been an attempt to mask the motives of extremists led by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was linked to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by reports of desecration coming as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan draws to a close.
Austria, meanwhile, is entering the search for its own soul after the transport failed in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties, which won together more than 30 percent of the vote, the Free Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, led a vehement anti-immigration campaign and some of their slogans were condemned as xenophobic.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the chairman of the Freedom Party, which won over 18 percent of the vote, protested against shawls and burqas in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to have a relationship with Islam.
At his last meeting with voters in Vienna, he spoke of a "European fraternity" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both sides are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets and argue that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the extreme right in the position of the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that this change was caused primarily by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to travel abroad.
Gary Glitter, a glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
Officials have imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after informing monitoring authorities that it plans to travel across France to Spain.
The travel ban was approved by the Kent Police last Thursday after it handed over evidence of Glitter’s past convictions for child sexual abuse to officials.
Glitter, named Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Lower Criminal Court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning lawyers.
A Justice Department spokesman said: "On Thursday 25 September, the Kent police at Ashford's lowest criminal court requested a regulation that would prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until 25 March.
Paul Gadd did not personally attend.”
Mr Glitter, 64, told authorities he wanted to travel abroad, according to a report in the Register of Sexual Assailants.
They must notify the authorities if they want to travel abroad for more than three days.
They also have to hand over the scheduled date of departure to the police a week in advance.
If he failed to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years in prison.
Kent police said they would not discuss individual cases of Glitter's possible routes through the county.
A Kent police spokesman said: “Kent police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it is easier to follow someone who will stay in the UK because we have extensive systems here that handle potential hazards more effectively.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for the Kent Police, and we are working hard to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders to minimize any danger to the public.”
Glitter returned to Britain last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and he refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities did not allow him to go through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to allow him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted on his return to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and stayed there while his attorney David Corker went to Uxbridge’s lowest criminal court in West London and at the same time Scotland Yard successfully requested an order that required him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously jailed for four months in the UK for possession of child pornography.
A source from the interior ministry said that Jacqui Smith, the interior minister, is calm and happy that Glitter was prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I photograph the master outside the scene." G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer - photographer
No heels, no bells, no costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, detached from the concentration on interpretation - only in this way do I achieve the relaxed expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
On the other hand, a man.
Indecisive, if we ignore privacy, in those moments far from the audience - then you can see a confidential gesture, the depth of the gaze captured by the air, or the passionate gesticulation of the hands, which are careless because they are not going to step on the stage.
German G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer alternates in the "Flamenco-people" theatrical performances with singers, dancers and guitarists with the lesser-known face of masters.
With this intention, the photographer compiles a unique iconography of flamenco from different environments.
The exhibition, which takes place within the program of the Month of Photography of Flamenco (Mes de la Fotograf<0xC3><0xAD>a Flamenca), "reflects the ever-growing international importance of flamenco", says the author and explains that "Flamenco-people" "can be any kind of people, but when you look at the photographs, you will find that they are not typical of the umcé of the giants.
These people portrayed "in the street" are artists capable of conveying passion, sadness, joy... and completely capture the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take photos on stage.
He carries his personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the flamenco giants.
Enchanted by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey of portraying flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on a board camera.
These are portraits that, thanks to the choice of camera and material, resemble classic photography.
The use of different stylistic means is contrary to the classic basis of the picture and lends it a contemporary spirit, which is an idea that, according to Bauer himself, also reflects flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which, however, does not cease to surprise and evolve."
What grabs the audience is not the action of the dance itself, the song or the game, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment when we will meet with the most essential, with that spirit that appears in the way of perception, of being and of experiencing, was and is the constant of the work presented during these days in the gallery of El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata.
This selection of almost seventy photographed artists is made up of famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyosov<0xC3><0xA1>, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco and soon there will be a book edition, which will contain exhibited portraits.
The passion for portraiture led Bauer two years ago to the idea of repeating the idea on "Portraits of a Sports Veteran" ("SportARTproject").
Although their concept is different from Flamenco-people, the photographer admits that "to photograph people, to know them and to have the opportunity for a moment, whether longer or just short, to enter into their lives - that's my passion.
I think in photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
A person meets or encounters people, personalities that he sometimes does not even know, or they will give him only a few minutes to take pictures.
Despite similar circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas.”
A collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco called "Flamenco-people" is on display at the Galeria El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata in Calle de la Mata 20, parallel to Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa has admitted that the novel he writes is "troubled"
Set in an environment he doesn’t yet know, he tells of events unknown to him, yet Mario Vargas Llosa intends to successfully carry out his new project – he is currently working on a novel whose main hero is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who has lived in the Congo for twenty years and traveled to the Amazon.
The Nobel Prize for Literature’s eternal favourite admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that is currently employing him “is daring” and that “everything suggests that I should not write” this novel.
"If I had reason, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I believe I will one day finish it," he concluded his contribution at the festival of exchanging ideas, ideas and words, which he saw in the city of the aqueduct over four days around hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands more.
The author of the novel "City and Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the celebration of the word and met expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for the most popular writer - the old edition of Dickens's "Our mutual friend" - filled the Juan Bravo theater to the last place.
With the image of Felix Rome, he had before him an audience devoted to him, to which the hour of his time ran like water; the Peruvian with an amazing precision and a great deal of humor remembered how he had been in the original "unbelievable adventure" from the "pleasure of a passionate reader" and from what he had done.
The Spanish-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to find out if and to what extent books can change one's life, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just a fun, fleeting experience" - Vargas Llosa emphasized that he "acted and acted" on people, and "acted" on them, and "acted" on them.
Due to climatology, the celebration in Pozoblanco is lost - the spear is missing
The performance with the spears, which concludes the celebration in Pozoblanc, was canceled yesterday morning after it was confirmed by the announcers that the surface of the square is not in good condition.
Therefore, the company, together with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonard Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, decided to cancel the bullfights.
Unfavourable weather conditions have plagued this celebration for a long time, as two of the three celebrations could not take place.
On Saturday, rain prevented the course of the second planned bullfights.
During them, the formations of José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista were to face the bulls in the arena on Castilblanca.
This was only celebrated on Friday.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut three ears and was rewarded with a dynamic and aesthetically pleasing performance on his shoulder.
On the same day, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two kicks for salutes and one ear, which brought him more uncovered seats in the arena than Toreadorian art.
Even worse was El Juli, who walked through the bullring of Los Llanos unsalted infatuated.
In the second round, without a single breath, he earned harsh criticism from most of the crowd.
They took control of <0xC3><0x81>lava in a van with two thousand kilograms of hashish
In ten minutes, five.
Ertzaintza road control in the urban district of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Officers stop two people in the van, and they're driving them.
The cargo, more than two tons of hashish, is unstoppable.
According to a report by the Basque Government’s Interior Department, the men were chased and detained by one of the people travelling in the van, a 38-year-old man who was identified as A. A. J.
The man was accused of smuggling drugs and falsifying state documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit carried out a roadside inspection of the N-1 at the places where it passes the border of the urban district of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were going to stop the van for inspection, but the driver did not follow the instructions, accelerated sharply and ran away.
Car owners immediately began to chase after the vehicle stopped at the edge a few kilometers away, at which point both passengers jumped up and set off to escape to a forested creek.
The Ertzaintza authorities finally caught up with one of them and seized 2,178 kilograms of hashish, which the suspects had transported, as revealed during the inspection of the Iveco Daily supply.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hashish packages, which were subsequently transferred to other police departments for detailed drug expertise and weighing.
In addition, the police found that the identification mark is "smoothed" and does not agree with the data indicated in the delivery documents, the detainee was therefore also accused of falsifying state documents.
Ertzaintza continues to search for a second suspect, who, as already mentioned, managed to escape in order to finally determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old A. A. J. was transferred to the police department to handle the appropriate formalities before later embarking on a further investigation.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under the Influence of Drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, popular Amanda from the Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of drugs.
The witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers as she tried to get out of the parking lot in Montecito, a spokesperson for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that at around 4.30 p.m., Locklear "stomped on gas, rode forward and backward in a loud roar and tried to get out of the parking lot - she crossed her sunglasses several times while reversing."
The witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw Locklear for a moment after stopping at a nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
This person also alerted the rescue service because "she was afraid for Locklear's life".
When police arrived at the scene, she found the actress inside the vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked disoriented," and so the members took her to a specialized drug and alcohol center to undergo the test.
According to the police spokesman, the actress cooperated and excessive amounts of alcohol were immediately excluded, yet "we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drugs, which was obvious to the officers at first sight".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of the effects of a more unspecified substance and was taken into custody around 7 p.m., although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic, where she recovered from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian association IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The head of the IU and a member of the United Left, Gaspar Llamazares, today announced that the final decision in the case of the former Youth and Sports Department of the Seville City Council, Francis Manuel Silva, who resigned from office last week after being accused of being a party to the proceedings in absentia.
"I'm too federalist, it's up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers," Llamazares said at a meeting that the party will have to attend in relation to a former member of the Seville city council.
The head of the IU, however, insisted that in the case of an investigation into the illegal acts that Silva committed, "transparency" is absolutely necessary: "IU has always fought for such matters to be as transparent as possible."
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"Blood of May" ('Blood of May'), an epic bet by Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a
José Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a in the film "Blood of May", inspired by the episodes of the national past of Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, revives the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French - this is the most ambitious film in his filmography with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "draw the proverbial figure and the analysis of society", which he always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today, together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paul Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a, during the presentation of the film to a large team of interpreters.
The May blood with footage of over two and a half hours will be put into cinemas this Friday and in the future more than four-hour series for Telemadrid TV is planned.
As a great admirer of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>se's literary work, José Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a claims that he fulfilled his "child's dream" by shooting this film, thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago under the Autonomous Province of Madrid to shoot the film for the twentieth anniversary of the Madrid mine, with the offer of a May 2 Epi.
The budget of 15 million, to which the province of Madrid has completely contributed, means for Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a's "unique opportunity" to create an environment with backdrops and costumes corresponding to the image of "shattering Spain, which was mistaken in the leader for whom it was possible to fight - the struggle for independence.
The director regrets, however, that he cannot count on the financial support that has been given to the films The Sad Wing (Ala triste) or Goy's Ghosts - almost twice the May Blood -, so he could not shoot some scenes from the script signed at the same time by Horace Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel, with his work on the film.
The director of the film "Start again" (Volver and empezar) works as he usually does - on the stage with actors with whom he usually tries before filming and who does not choose casting, because it seems "humiliating" to him and also thinks that he "sucks up after other things".
Many of the actors he chose for Blood of May have already appeared in front of his camera, such as Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, with four Oscar nominations, one of which he won, is of the opinion that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the May Blood itself, the Seven Tables of the French Billiards and the last selected Blind Sunflowers, represent a young generation of filmmakers.
There are no awards for this film.
"At first, you think you're working for what's next, but then you realize you're working for what's next, and you're willing to make one more movie," Garcia said.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n revives the spiritual legacy of Seville dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
The flamenco dancer of Seville pays tribute to the other dancers of Seville.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, from the father of Catalan (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and the mother of Andalusian (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and when she was three years old, they moved with their family to London.
She danced modern dance and focused on oriental dance.
She lived a passionate life, pioneering female emancipation as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian and fought for the abolition of the corset, which made it impossible for women to move freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, fascinated Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me - I thought it was incredible."
According to the dancer, "we're not talking about telling her life, but about capturing her soul.
The names of her dance performances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So "moth dance" evoked a guajira or "snake dance" some tango.
Her dance was sensual and they told me that my dance also corresponds to this aesthetic,” she says.
The performance is expected to involve two exceptional personalities: with Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabele in one performance, as well as in "Open Doors" (La porta aperta), and with the dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and joined the collaboration with her former <0xC5><0xBD>a<0xC5><0xBE>a.
"Matilde is an older T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola, a mature character.
I am happy that she accepted the offer to participate in my project, and it is a great honour for me."
The performance also features the music and guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Pac Arriaga, with the singing of Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the drums of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jara, the violin of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of actor Juanfra Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, "who has the role of eternal guide of this kind of artists, who are always inspired by them".
The work also takes into account the life of this woman, who played for her time in such distant places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, because she usually stayed in London.
"I wanted to remind her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at a certain time, but today no one knows her and even less appreciates her work," says Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The show starts at 8:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "Diary of the newly married" also closes the triennial
The introduction of the first illustrated edition of "The Diary of a Freshly Married Man" in Saint Stephen's Church, New York, at the time of the death of Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez after his marriage to Zenobia in March 1916, is part of a program coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" (in 2006).
The "Zenobie and Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Triennial" is coming to an end with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York City, a repair of the Nobel Museum House, and a traveling exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: The Sunbeam", which opened in May of this year, and was to be held in March.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia has also commissioned eight hundred copies of the "D<0xC3><0xAD>n<0xC3><0xAD>k <0xC3><0xBA>ltimo Marado" edited by Pedro Taberner and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis to continue to spread awareness of the personality and work of one of the world's most celebrated Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman no longer likes itself so much
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who collaborated with him on "No Evil Intentions" and under the weight of the knowledge that Newman is gone, reveals her unsatisfied vision of abandoned American cinema and the whole of America.
Look how long it took them to get an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And that he knew he was seriously ill.
Still, he was a guy for everybody.
"Sometimes what a man feels can't be expressed in any way, and I've lost a great friend now," Robert Redford said in tears, "my life and my country have been better because of him."
No one was afraid that he would be ridiculous or exaggerated.
The film’s father and father died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, at a time when American self-confidence is at the bottom of a desperate search for reasons to be proud.
When times are rough and people without virtues and only a handful of those who are worth admiring – you don’t have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for lost and won cases, from a foundation against drug addiction based in honor of his firstborn son, who died of overdose, to his own brand of home-cooked food and bio-food.
A complete treasure trove for a country that took a lot of effort to break free from a suicidal eating culture.
A stormy wave of admiration flooded Hollywood regardless of nationality or nationality.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but an entire era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was no exaggeration at the top of his career.
The evil Australian boy, Russell Crowe, dared to call Newman his greatest source of inspiration.
"That fox has planted a pretty high bar for all of us," says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who has the courage to try to live like Paul Newman today - based on honesty and leading a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy in today’s media jungle, sometimes even possible.
But fortunately, such people are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He divorced once, and since then he has been married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, who was faithful, although he certainly had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a fillet at home?" he joked.
May he be accompanied in heaven by pride in the fact that there is harmony on earth between his daughters and admirers - this is not very common in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he embodied, he was most proud of the role of a devoted husband, a loving father, a willing grandfather, and a self-sacrificing philanthropist."
Imperfect Races of the Olympic Games in Madrid
Yes, many of us long for the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after a failed 2012 it may be 2016.
But I ask myself: are we ready?
If we're going to be driving yesterday's race, I say no!
It was talked about as a perfect race, and in my judgment it was the worst I've ever been to.
So much nonsense that as soon as it was evaluated and I was a tester, it would be clearly insufficient.
But let's look at it from the beginning, pretty much one after the other.
Nonsense begins with the collection of the race number, for which a person must leave first.
I don’t think that’s bad, but when a person goes there, let them give him everything (including a chip to avoid overcrowding the track).
Oh, no.
Here one had to pick up the number first (first nonsense, go there only because of it) and (after protruding the appropriate front) - what a surprise! - they only had a T-shirt size S (second nonsense, because I need size XL).
Where do we live?
Because of the crisis, they decided to buy only small T-shirts, because they are less fabrics and are cheaper?
Well, that's a little bit compared to what happened on race day.
In addition to the fact that it had to go very early for the chip and the front took over 15 minutes, he still had to surrender his backpack there.
It took over 35 minutes of waiting time, which is something incomprehensible at the race, where 11,000 people are expected.
So, as you might expect, the race started and we haven't put our bags down yet, and when it did, the pickup was a lot worse.
In addition, the wait was prolonged by 40 minutes of rain, which led to a general uprising and an attack on the cabin.
I believe that 500 of us will have pneumonia tomorrow and some like me will not show the right time in evaluating the results because of the chip they gave me and which, I suppose, did not correctly record the time of the start.
Of course, if someone had asked me about a perfect race, I wouldn't have thought of this one.
And so I think we're going to have to make it seem like a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a reception (virtual)
At the MIT conference on new technologies, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in a new system of image recognition and human interaction in the way of artificial intelligence - not too intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a messenger that would move around the premises of the company) and perceiving what is happening.
Thanks to a camera and a system that recognizes shapes and faces, this "reception" can find out how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the key words of their conversations.
It can also sort the present by conversation groups.
On the demonstration video, the receptionist records a third person and understands that they do not belong to the group that is talking to them, and that they are not employees of the company.
He asks her if she's going to see anyone, and tells her she'll be in touch with him in a moment.
All this without the blue screen of death.
Splendid.
Of course, this is the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, such as a new version of Windows.
There has been a lot of talk this week about changing Microsoft’s strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer figured that if computers had only the essentials, without the burden of commercial waste, they would be five times more powerful—man, Steve, they’d be cheaper.
Discovering as thunder, considering that Microsoft version from the version adds new features to Windows and other "extras".
A change of direction would be a worthwhile act.
Microsoft is right, the operating system is slowly losing its importance and so is the software.
When Google Chrome appeared on the network, I became one of those who subscribe to the theory that this was Google’s first step towards competing with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary, because it is a necessary layer for understanding between hardware and software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to the mother-in-law.
That's true.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system and more and more to the Internet browser.
The computer turns on to run Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and we spend more time on the internet every day than around the windows.
What is the use of half of the applications that accompany the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and I have a small example here.
I took this photo in a Microsoft employee lounge in Redmond at the beginning of the month.
On the drink vending machine was a poster asking them to use their search tools: "Your search. Our future."
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, a new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's count down to 2010.
At Microsoft, they will certainly try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they will have to pay dearly for the delay.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in one shine in Edward Zwick's "Blood Diamond", as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppoly's "Kmotro" and in addition it is part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to be included in the list of his life roles, we can immerse ourselves in the image of a typical muscle with a pointed mustache that raises the bar in the nomadic circus.
Essentially, it’s nothing more than a typical cotton men’s undershirt, fitted and sleeveless.
English speakers call it a ‘tank’, but Le Fabuleux Marcel from Brussels stands out above all others.
First of all, because of its name - although it is popularly called 'Marcel' - which has to do with sports, because, according to legend, it was named after the boxer Marcel Cerdan, the lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out above the other high-quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label and (almost imperceptible) Belgian flag, which have models of the more unimpressive backs as a detail at the neck.
And be careful, because the Belgian company does not specialize only in tank tops.
It also produces college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy T-shirts, children's suits, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
It's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too pretty.
"I want to be a young mother. I don't care who's going to be a father."
The enormous appearance of her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz, though a small figure, is a woman full of life.
The Cruz sisters are now taking their new role in fashion very seriously.
For M<0xC3><0xB3>nica, this means much more than just that some pretty, famous girls will lend their name.
In Paris, she attended a promotional event organized by Mango in its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the most insignificant fashion awards sponsored by this Spanish company.
She's hearty and shy, and she'll get you up close and personal.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present a new collection, which my sister Penelope and I have proposed for Mango for this autumn-winter season, and at the same time I took part in the announcement of the second edition of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentina.
It was a challenging but also an exciting day.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango, for which you are already working on the fourth season?
My sister and I love movies from the 50s and 60s, and we drew a lot of inspiration from them.
I also like to travel around the city and watch women walk around dressed, how they combine and layer their clothes, I do it very often.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but after all, everything is connected and has many connections.
I almost liked the clothes, I always wanted to go to my grandmother's, talk in my aunt's closet and look at her clothes.
It was a sensation, almost better than going on a trip.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I walk in my clothes.
However, you know that we dancers rely on how we are arranged to feel good in our classes and rehearsals when looking in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, then you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You're 30, you're in a crisis?
No way.
I'm feeling better than I've ever felt before, I'm in my 30s.
I find that a woman is already ready, has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
Biological clocks don't scare me.
I almost do what I want, and that gives me great inner happiness.
So you're thinking about being a mother, aren't you?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my body wants it, and besides, I want to be a young mother, I don’t want to miss it.
When it comes to my father, I don't worry about that.
But one thing I know for sure, I will give my child a feeling of happiness and will raise him with great love.
As for the film, there are several premieres of the films you made last year.
That's the way it is, and I'm looking forward to them coming to the movies.
I come from the theatrical world, so I am very impatient and restless, I want everything now and of course it is not possible.
I am looking forward to the premiere of "La ultima hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
By the way, how do you like it...
A few days ago, you had your premiere at the parade pier next to Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I'm going to the pier as a model.
Just called me by Naomi Campbell, who I’ve known for a long time, and invited me to London to attend the benefit shows for her organization “Women for a Better Life,” and the clothes we were showing — I also picked two models from our Mango collection — were auctioned off and the proceeds were gone.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
There's a lot of talk about it, and I know it, and I can tell you that a lot of it's not true.
Besides, I'm gonna stick to the good stuff he's involved in.
She asked me to perform for charity, but if she asks me to do a stand, I'll do it too.
For the benefit of third world women, I will do whatever it takes.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install an "alcolock"
The Ministry of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative penalties for driving under the influence of alcohol must install a system in his car that will prevent him from starting the car intoxicated or if he does not breathe.
The proposal was announced in June of this year and is now included in the annual report of the Supreme State Prosecutor’s Office, according to which it is a pilot project that will last one year.
Its goal is to return the driver behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to take a transport retraining course.
In addition to the National Transportation Safety Authority, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Institute of Technology for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will also participate in this experience.
According to statistics, between 30 and 75% of motorists accused of driving drunk more than once will sit behind the wheel again in this state.
Alcolock should avoid this, as it is a system connected to a vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaust air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe beforehand or if there is a higher than permissible concentration of alcohol.
His price exceeds 1,000 euros and it would have to be paid by the culprit himself.
A study carried out in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with this device had a 65% reduction in offences during the first year since its introduction.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 people could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behaviour before it results in a criminal offence.
And to help implement it, since the legislation can be carried out in the usual way, the necessary modification of criminal provisions requires a change in the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any sales version, although some industrial vehicles and public service vehicles have already been tested.
Tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on the PSOE (Spanish Workers’ Socialist Party) proposal, which recommends installing this system on school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without "peeptoes"
With British precision, at 5.40 p.m., as scheduled, a Spanish Air Force aircraft landed in the presidential hangar at Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez Airport in Mexico City, in which the Prince and Princess of Asturias arrived.
The sun had just set, but his rays had still forced him to cover his eyes with his hands so that he could see a pair of followers coming out of the plane.
The meeting was attended by the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I asked the taxi driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish prince and the princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, that's great, it won't be able to get to the airport at that time to pick up people... she's out of here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's right...
However, the Mexican press knows very well who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the hangar at the airport, right next to the red carpet and the military cordon, which consists of 27 marines ready to fire an honorable salvo.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a suit of dark blue color and the princess, very alternately dressed and with curly hair, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently reported to her that there is a storm in D. F.
Before they go to the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and pose for them without coercion.
At the door of the hotel where they will be staying, one of the four largest in the city, a Mexican television reporter is waiting for them.
Best-Rated Fashion Price
There is probably no better place in the world to announce a fashion award than Paris and there is probably no better designer and bonviv<0xC3><0xA1>na than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second edition of the El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards to enable an international presentation of new fashion talents.
The price is subsidised by 300 000 euros.
The Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, winner of the first year, looked at her designs yesterday in a Manga exhibit on Paris’s Haussmann Boulevard No. 54 and almost cried with emotion.
Of course, it is the second largest store of this company in Europe and has just been opened on an area of 1,335 square meters.
The largest one is in London.
Many events, along with the desire to thank the designers Valentin for taking over the chairmanship of the competition jury, caused us to finally have a lavish dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
Mango’s festively decorated presidential table looked a little more amazing next to Chagall’s most famous works.
Nati, who, heartbroken by the recent death of her brother, did not reveal anything, put on the dress of this brand and the ELAH jewels over which he hid his breath, and hanged herself to her son Luis - an almost two-meter-elegant - accompanied Valentina at the head of the table at the dinner table.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, accepted the welcome and, as a true gentleman, remained with Baron Rothschild without a jacket, as they were both offered to two ladies.
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Cruz, who arrived at the store in her pants and shirts - hand-crafted - and dressed herself in long black sexy dresses for dinner, took a night walk around the Opera House accompanied by Goya Toledov<0xC3><0xA1>, showed us the ballroom for ballet rehearsals, and showed us the dance floor.
Inés Sastreov<0xC3><0xA1> did not stop for a tour of the side buildings of the palace, but before leaving she showed us photos of her son on a mobile phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the presence of Olivier Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez – another young man riding a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who came to the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own bed linen and towels and asked in advance that no fragrances be used in his rooms.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001 - anti-stress number
Not 1000, but 1000 plus one way to forget about chaotic and frantic everyday life.
And not to mention, they are all summarized in one book, which on September 30th will bring relaxation to the bookstore.
The alarm clock rings every morning at 7 a.m. as a punishment, but it is even worse to imagine yourself absorbed in the hasty rhythm that brings the present life.
The office is called tension and computer back pain.
Stress is a disease of the 21st century.
However, there are neither one nor two methods to fight daily exhaustion and problems of disconnecting from the world of work.
No, that number is nothing bigger and nothing less than 1001.
Susannah Marriott, outside of the yoga position, classical massages and "spa" therapy on the pages of her book, has collected a whole "menu" of options, adapted to the taste and timing of each individual.
The anti-stress book is called "1001 way of relaxation" and thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK will bring peace to the bookshop.
If one considers that it is not possible to achieve peace in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "handbook" denies this opinion.
In addition, it offers other procedures to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If you no longer have adrenaline in your veins, which restores balance in the body, and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off and focus on reading.
Talking from sleep
Some children talk at night.
I don't mean those who wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but children who talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it may scare you, but in fact, it’s meaningless.
This is a harmless sleep disorder called somnilloquia.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure none of you were told he was talking in his sleep last night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (for example, once a lifetime in high fevers), or with more regularity (every day, once a week, once a few months...), the second day the child does not remember anything.
There is not a single reason for her arrival.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night rage, nocturnal enuresis (nighttime help) or flatulence, but this may not be the case.
As mentioned earlier, it can often accompany very high fevers, stressful or aggravated situations.
In any case, this is a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also different.
The child can speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or just the opposite (screams, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where it manifests with great force, it would be appropriate to observe and consult with a specialist to see if he has any problem that causes him great anxiety and thus manifests itself.
We said that it is a harmless disorder, therefore it is not treated, only if it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with apnea syndrome or with permanent stress).
However, we can do this by keeping in mind a few very simple preventive measures, such as:
Try not to disturb the baby too much before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV shows or serials.
In very nervous children and those who give the job to relax, it is possible to use relaxation techniques that will help them to get some inner peace.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
When somnolence appears, try to remain calm.
Remember that it is harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of what happened.
Helpful Advice
Don't be him.
It's useless, because he's not conscious and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even when he speaks, he sleeps, and therefore rests.
Remember that if you think several times in a row that you are very worried, it would be advisable to seek advice or find out what causes such anxiety in a child.
If he understands what he is saying (which is not so common), avoid the temptation to interrogate him and extract information from him.
It won't do any good, because when he's asleep, he's not conscious of being able to organize his thoughts.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he thinks, and therefore why he says it, so pay close attention to how you interpret the information and what conclusions you come to.
Never tell a child that you can ask him about his secrets at night.
It's not funny.
That's causing a lot of anxiety.
Don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s just an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
Illhaeusern finally found his way to victory after a long period of thinning.
Without playing a particularly big game, the yellow-blacks created more chances and managed to turn one of them into a winner.
The game did not have too fast pace during this clash, in which the attackers were only difficult to advance.
After the first attempt of the captain of the hosts Kauffmann, who fired from a distance only by a hair lost the connector, Illhaeusern began to have a slight top and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne aired, Romain on a long leg or also Diebold gradually came to irritate the defense of Dannemarie.
The opponent, on the other hand, built a defensive wave in the middle of the field and left only the agile Riahi at the tip of the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, first thanks to Dannemarie's two chances with the names Riahi and Temporale, then after the opening score for Illhaeusern, which Marais took care of, well positioned for the ball's processing reflected after the previous Diebold's attempt (53).
However, Illhaeusern's goalie did not enjoy the joy for a long time, after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room and leave his teammates in a state of weakness.
However, Dannemarie was unable to make the most of it, and the eleven of Illhaeusern, who had only a little withdrawn to "tighten" the defense, caused no more trouble, except for the last few seconds of the match, when the ball flew very close to the belly after a great confusion.
Sarkozy goes to meet angry fishermen <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a trip through Brittany.
To face a demonstration of the strength of fishermen, who on Monday severely disrupted the accessibility of several Breton and Norman ports, the French president decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec in Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re to meet with their representatives there.
The latter have promised to be accepted "in a constructive spirit", and hope that "it will come with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee" set up by Breton fishermen to take action against a sharp rise in oil prices that has reached a peak of more than 1.14 euros per litre on average.
According to Elysée Palace spokesman David Martinon, the president "will talk to them about solutions that can be imagined in an effort to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions of employment and payment of seafarers."
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with intransigence.
On Tuesday morning, they performed a "snake" (slow-moving vehicle operation) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing almost 10km of traffic jams.
The resort port in Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le were not interrupted.
A filtration dam was opened on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors showed their determination as early as Monday, when tires and pallets were burning in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient at dawn, while demonstrations were taking place in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the Channel, such as the Sables d'Olonne in Vendée, where trawlers remained in the port, or to Le Havre, where about twenty vessels blocked the operation of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisic in the Loire-Atlantique region stopped the blockade of the important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
Those from Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until they decide to act themselves, until Wednesday's meeting at the ministry.
The "crisis committee" is due to decide on Tuesday on how to proceed along the path ahead, and on its participation in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
However, some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the State Fisheries Department who did not support their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not let go of anything" and "they do not want to come to Paris," said Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient Fisheries Department.
Professional fishermen who do not pay the oil tax currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but judge that the yield threshold of the ship is reached only when the oil is below 0.30 euros per litre.

Embraer maintains its supply conditions for 2008
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer relies on the supply of 215 aircraft this year, despite the threat of a recession that looms over the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer, maintains its supply requirements for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado, confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian designer promises a lot from the Chinese market, especially in terms of its range of aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in the span of eight years.
AIG is considering transferring 15% of its assets.
The insurer American International Group, which the U.S. monetary authorities have received over water, is considering transferring more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion that was given to it as a deposit, the Financial Times reported on Sunday.
The AIG is prepared to investigate the sale of most of its non-life insurance activities in the international field and pension activities in the United States, the newspaper said, citing sources close to the ongoing negotiations.
According to FT, the AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to investigate any referrals.
It was not possible to obtain any confirmatory statement from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to dispose of include its International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its portfolio of real estate and private equity investments.
No final decision on these transfers has yet been taken, FT continues.
AIG must quickly obtain cash to repay the $85 billion loan it received from the Federal Reserve Bank, with the risk that the U.S. authorities will seize 80% of its capital, thereby diluting it to the appropriate ratio of the current shareholder.
Paris. Analysis of the historic meeting Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to save banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped from 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
The largest point drop in its history (by 684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, the day of the resumption of trading following the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The Nasdaq index with the dominant technology component lost, according to definitive data after the close of trading, 199,61 points and settled at 1,983,73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8,81 % (i.e. 106,85 points) to 1,106,55 points.
Confused since the start of the session, Wall Street has literally collapsed after an unexpected rejection of a plan to save the House of Representatives banks, a plan that was supposed to allow some stability to be found in the markets again.
228 votes against and 205 for the representatives refused to give Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson the means he requested.
Almost two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“It’s a bad signal sent to the market that sees Congress not being able to adopt a particular plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"It shows how much the market relied on this plan," she added, expressing concerns that the project adopted in a few days would not come "too late."
“If this project is really doomed, it will immediately be handed over to the Fed and other central banks to fuel the crisis, which would further strengthen credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And stressing the urgency of the situation, Piegzaov said that in the United States, “every new day brings the downfall of one financial institution.”
After Friday’s crash, Washington Mutual organized the authorities to buy Wachovia’s banking assets from its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has suddenly taken a turn and called for urgent intervention in favour of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, suggesting that markets are facing “not just the US crisis, but the global crisis,” said an analyst at FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen sharply.
Cash receipt yield for 10 years fell to 3.632 % from 3.827 % on Friday evening, yield for 30 years to 4.161 % from 4.357 % on the previous day.
Obama Wins Points in First TV Duel
After the first debate between the two candidates in the White House on Friday, the second debate followed, whose task was to find out who of the pair John McCain and Barack Obama won.
The Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters were not surprised when the two announced their victory in a televised duel watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, however decent, was not “brilliant” enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a decline in polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published on Saturday awarded Obama a five-point lead (49% versus 44% for McCain), believes the Democrat is the one who won the duel.
Among the undecided voters that matter right now, Obama is the winner for 39% of those polled, while, according to a CBS poll, 25% ascribes victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his leadership on Thursday with the expected good performance of his running mate Joseph Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's talented," Bill Clinton said of the weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain consistently highlighted his undisputed experience in the field of foreign policy, while stressing his opponent’s “naiveness” on issues that formed the core of the first clash.
"Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." was a repeated accusation.
"I don't think Senator Obama would have enough experience and knowledge to become president," he said.
In such an offensive spirit, Republican TV spots have been running since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that he represents the future.
He did not lose his head and proved to be brief and precise.
He highlighted his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good reputation of the United States in the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand it, while Obama does," said a Democratic spot this weekend, which blames the Republican for not taking enough into account the impact of the crisis on the "ordinary American."
“During the 90-minute debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing to say about you,” Obama told 20,000 people gathered at a North Carolina pre-election meeting in heavy rain.
He didn't even say the words "middle class" or "working class." The financial breakdown clearly favors Obama, whom the Americans consider more capable of saving the economy on the brink.
"There could be a turning point next week," said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, likened Obama’s “economic foresight” to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current disaster is “the ultimate verdict of eight-year bad economic policy, as operated by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite the unexpected jumps in Wall Street, he should be able to reduce the taxes of 95% of Americans, and also noted that the realization of the country's eventual energy independence through the promotion of renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the introduction of a health care system.
McCain plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates cautiously avoided questions about the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial aid plan adopted by Congress last night, which is highly unpopular.
"Did you notice that there was an election in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening immediately after the closing of polling stations in the main square in Minsk to protest against the irregularity of parliamentary elections.
Although no results have been announced so far, many young people came to demonstrate against the regime of President Lukashenko: "dictator, resignation".
Some admit that they did not even go to the elections: "What would it be like if they did what they wanted with my voice anyway," says one young man.
They do not believe that this regime, which has behaved favourably towards foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be prepared to make a shift towards democracy.
The sanctions, which include a visa ban for 40 Belarusian sex offenders and the freezing of some assets, could be lifted if the elections are considered clean by observers.
According to the opposition, this was not the case.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote counting," said Juri Potemkin, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse group of twelve parties.
"This is a cosmetic change," emphasizes Alexandr Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure of the pro-European movement, "because it is important who counts the votes, and it is an executive power in our country.
If any opposition MPs get into parliament, it will be by being appointed, not elected.
However, their entry into parliament can mean space on television, meetings in the regions and bills.”
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political process, because "a dialogue with the European Union needs to be initiated.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is affected by the crisis and we do not reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which monitored the elections, will not declare the elections valid.
He stresses that participation seems to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way for all possible manipulations.
"Did you notice that there was an election?" asked Social Democratic leader Alexandr Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners released in August of this year.
“There was no foot in the room.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, those who are most in line with the regime."
The silence of the night has once again taken hold in the October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate each other on their success.
Interview - Blood That's Sure Again
Héma-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was justifiably pleased as Héma-Québec became one of the most reliable and effective blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he regained the trust of the public, which was seriously shaken after the blood-contaminated scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is generally known, the national blood supply administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Department was contaminated during the 1980s by the immune deficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus.
In view of this drama and wave of public unrest, the Canadian government launched a public inquiry in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at explaining the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and making recommendations that such a disaster should never happen again.
While Judge Krever hesitated to deliver the report, some provinces set in motion a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélinea Committee took on this role.
Following the Gélineau and Krever report, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, which was to manage Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all provinces and both territories.
“When Héma-Québec started its activities in 1998, only 38% of people still had confidence in the Quebec blood system,” says Dr. Décary.
"The situation was disconcerting.
Through our consistent efforts to increase the safety of blood products, and our continued work in this area over the next few years, we have regained public confidence," he says, adding proudly that at the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population trusted Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary does not lose sight of the fact that "trust is something very fragile".
Since its establishment on September 28, 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
"We witnessed many cases of human form mad cow disease in Europe back then, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease," says the woman, who has led the company since its founding in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could spread blood.
We have therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which, in the event that we do not know and when a serious disease is at stake, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by degeneration of the brain inevitably leads to death.
In April 1999, we therefore refused blood from people who had been in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
A few years ago, it was safely proven that this disease is transmitted by blood.
So this episode showed us that it made sense to stick to the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a much more accurate technique for detecting the HIV virus appeared on the market: tests using nucleic acid (NAT), which allow to detect in donor blood directly the presence of the virus itself, and not the presence of antibodies on which the tests used before were based.
NAT tests have made it possible to shorten the deafening period that occurs between the moment of infection of the patient and the moment when our techniques can detect the first viruses in the blood, explains the specialist.
We were able to shorten this period to less than a week.
We have significantly reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without them knowing about it and without us being able to figure it out.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of getting AIDS through blood transfusions.
One in 12 million people are at risk of getting HIV-contaminated blood.
“In other words, it means that before anyone gets HIV, 12 million blood products will need to be distributed.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products annually, it will take 24 years for the first case of HIV transmission through the blood product to appear.
I believe that today we can safely get or prescribe the transfusion of blood necessary for healing," says Héma-Québec.
“The challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
We never know what disease-causing element may appear in the system.
Just last year, a chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted into the blood by suffocating insects.
It is necessary to be constantly cautious," continues Dr. Décary, stressing that in addition to safe supply, Héma-Québec must also count on sufficient supply.
“Needs are growing because the population is getting older.
As a result of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of Quebecers eligible to donate."
Every healthy person is at least 18 years old, meeting the eligibility criteria, but can donate blood only once in 56 days, that is, six times a year.
14% of people offering blood are not accepted on average because they are, for example, carriers of AIDS or malaria, and if they have visited a country where marshy colds are managed, they are excluded for a period of one year.
"With these 3%, we can maintain a state that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
However, the members of the donor network need to be supplemented in proportion to how old they are and can no longer donate blood.
However, it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, especially to keep it and encourage them to become regular donors.
Life is so unchained today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood," Francine Décary said.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissue, such as bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin, which is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Hém-Québec, which also manages the only public cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord, previously thought to be biomedical waste, is overflowing with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our 1,000 umbilical cord blood samples to the bank and we expect to collect over 1,000 blood samples per year.
At the beginning of next year, we should start offering them for transplants," says Dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Some moms are disappointed that they don't have access to it," because Héma-Québec doesn't have enough funds to offer this comprehensive and expensive program to all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - Impact in the semi-finals
Impact Montréal qualified for the USL First Division knockout round yesterday at Saputo Stadium during the second and crucial quarter-final match played on the total number of goals, thanks to a 3:1 (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) win over the Seattle Sounders.
Antonio Ribeiro scored a decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the two-sided goalless first half, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino scored the remaining two goals of the Montreal formation.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could deal with Matt Jordan for the benefit of the Sounders.
Recall that on Friday during the first of two matches of the quarterfinals, Impact suffered a 2:1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila on the outskirts of Seattle.
The impact will measure in the semifinals with the Whitecaps from Vancouver.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, Thunder settled for a 3-1 deficit in the home game and eventually won 4:3, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semi-final round with a total of 5:4 goals.
Impact is expected to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadien's first attacking trio is ready to start the season.
The unit consisting of Alex Kovalev, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekance and Andreje Kosticin last night at the Centre Bell encouraged the attack to win the Canadien 3:2 on separate incursions.
Kostitsin, the biggest star of the clash, scored a goal, Plekanec collected two assists and Kovalev collected one goal in this fourth three-color victory of the six preliminary matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal during separate incursions.
"I'm not ready yet," the Russian said.
"I need another game to feel good."
"In the first third, he tried to do too much," said Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice applause."
Charest bet on the north
The Prime Minister does not rule out that he will call early elections by the end of the year
Immediately after the Liberal Party congress ended, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health Yves Bolduc (left) is running in today’s supplementary elections.
"Shut down the boundaries of our last great northern frontier": this is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented in a visually appealing way yesterday at the end of the Quebec Liberal Party's Lévis convention, without giving details.
During his speech, images were projected behind his back in some kind of a picture mill.
On three huge canvases there was a loop with remarkable images of hydroelectric dams, down, Quebec from the point of view of "Google Maps", maps, etc.
They are generous, just like in the pre-election period.
At the press conference, the prime minister refused to rule out calling early elections in the autumn, although he pointed out that he had a very busy schedule.
The “Plan North” is the fourth dimension of the “vision” that the prime minister envisages for Quebec, a vision of a “new economic space” that includes a labor agreement with France, a Canada-Europe agreement, and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the fact that the opening of the North - the northern territory on the 49th parallel - the Prime Minister has recently often mentioned in his statements, has never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North represents a "jewel with huge potential", but did not specify a date, amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
At the very least, he mentioned several approaches to the points that could be further diluted: in particular water power plants, forests, but above all the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of developing countries and the restoration of public infrastructure.
The North, according to Charest’s list, contains “nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds.”
This "area twice the size of France is in our country" is in Quebec.
And it’s not just with us, it’s in us,” he said, as if to show that he was referring to a certain national founding myth.
Quebec was built to a large extent in relation to the North, the prime minister highlighted: the hunt for gold in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future," he added after taking a theatrical pause to look at the huge map behind his back.
The North, 70% of the territory of Quebec, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always demanded, the Prime Minister said during a press conference.
"This is a traditional attitude that has been repeated by all previous governments.
“There is one border line that has not been in existence for a long time, and if the opportunity arises, I will re-appreciate this position on behalf of the government,” he said.
Otherwise, "in the context of climate change, it is also necessary to rethink our vision of the North", he said when speaking about the North-West transition, which will open year-round as a result of the melting of glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking over the territory becomes a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would be beneficial to them, especially to young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former Pequisan MP from Ungava), have begun negotiations with some thirty communities.
The action was initiated by an inter-ministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role.
The Prime Minister does not rule out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but the moment "a common vision will be drawn".
The development of the North should be carried out in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North’s plan will be “jointly designed, structured and environmentally friendly,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as a fluid follow-up to the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have changed our minds to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the still-shattered topics of the weekend, which was launched on Friday with a great cocktail highlighting the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s rise to the top of the party.
One of the resolutions passed proposes to rename Beauharnois's headquarters to the Adélard-Godbout dam.
“From Godbout, who founded Hydro-Québec, through Lesage, who carried out the Quiet Revolution and the nationalization of water power, to Bourass, who created James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future,” said Jean Charest.
At a press conference, he appealed to another authority, this time conservative, namely the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, which premiered between 1957 and 1963.
When the line came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam, Charest stressed that its launch is planned for 2012.
"I'm just saying it between us, but I plan to be there," he confided to his member base, causing a considerable applause.
The same prime minister, who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of calling an election in the fall of this year, which is what the law allows him to do.
However, he stressed that his program is loaded, especially with the mission of the Federal Council in China and the Québec-New York summit.
The weekend's convention provided the Liberal leader with a platform for some nationalist resolutions, particularly some "efforts to change the constitution" that went very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) demands in particular recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also wants Quebec to appoint a number of members of the Canadian Radio and Television Council who would have veto power in the case of decisions taken in Quebec.
On the part of the opposition, the North Plan was adopted skeptically in its main features.
The head of the PQ (Parti Québecois) Pauline Marois once again pulled out the Development Policy of North Quebec, which Landry’s government launched in 2001.
According to her, when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it renounced the implementation of this policy.
If she had stuck to it, "we'd go on today," Marois remarked alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the election is taking place today) Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Mercure.
The ADQ said it would support the adoption of the North Plan in the government.
"But we do wish it wasn't just a theatre," said Sébastien Proulx, leader of Maria Dumont's party, who is returning from the holidays.
Letters - The Desecrated Land
It was Vic Toews, the former "justice" (ironically) minister in Harper's Cabinet, who last summer allowed himself to say about Louise Arbour that she was "shameful" to Canada.
To insult a woman who fought tirelessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration in this way tells a lot about the prime minister’s surroundings and about Stephen Harper himself.
We have before us a government that, as the only one of all the Western countries involved, has not transported back to the homeland of its citizen imprisoned in the Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo concentration camp.
The government, which does not consider at all that at the time when the acts that are being blamed on him should have taken place, Omar Khadr was a young teenager.
The only government that, despite Canada’s signing of the Geneva Convention, denies its word and lets a child soldier rot in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to judge the defendant's guilt.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and, in particular, the Canadian Bar Association are defending the repatriation of Omar Khadra so that a fair trial can be expected in Canada.
The same government closes its eyes to torture: little does it care that this young man is psychologically destroyed in the future, and undoubtedly permanently, after so many years of torture.
We are not aware of it, but we are witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedom, and our “democracy,” words that Harper bends over so much and that his mouth sounds so empty.
The time has come when there is no longer any morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, treat him badly, imprison him according to the will of the head of the minority government so far (as it will be after October 14...).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in the party that proclaims Dignity, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what has made up the reputation and seriousness of our country.
Shame on you, Mr. Toews, in this renunciation, not elsewhere.
Opinions - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Discourse
In a September 17 issue, Le Devoir printed a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, he confirms that the world's largest gold producer has launched a prosecution of three authors and a poor small publishing house for insulting honor in order to spark a "transparent public debate" and demands six million from them.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, they do not judge the truth, especially in the case of prosecution for an insult to honor, but the law.
It is not surprising that Garver completely misses this crucial distinction.
Or is it the best way for Barrick Gold to conduct a public debate, to bring to ruin anyone who would dare to defend the opposite position?
Whatever the case may be, the authors and publisher of the book Noir Canada (Black Canada) will be forced to spend respectable sums to be prepared to defend themselves and fight in a very unbalanced battle with an army of lawyers backed by the almost bottomless pockets of a mining company.
Tactics in these unbalanced struggles, after all, often consist in ruining the defendants in order to enforce a conciliation procedure that will silence the mouth of the opposing party and, moreover, frighten anyone who would dare to devote himself to this matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it had to present its view of the whole thing to the public.
Contrary to what is happening in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, the debate in normal circumstances lies in the exchange of ideas, and not in the wounds of a shoe.
Mining companies, therefore, had no choice but to open their books, their documentation, and establish a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and funding of independent scientific teams that could bring light to the whole thing.
Barrick Gold, however, seems to have no confidence in public opinion and sneers at petitions and letters in support of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he could demand a "public debate" while at the same time repudiating the views of the same public?
It seems that in the vice president’s world, this word only refers to fat-paid lawyers, and not all Canadians; it’s a pretty narrow concept of this term.
In a democracy, even whistleblowers have the right to speak.
Barrick Gold does not understand - or does not want to understand - that the public, which supports the authors and publishers of Noir Canada, does so primarily because it rejects the brutal ways of mining society.
The public is prepared to hear Barrick and judge the case, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not within what many perceive as a prosecution, in which the defendant is to have his mouth shut (in the context of his prosecution of the "public debate" Barrick, by the way, has just filed a formal challenge to the Canadian author to have him prosecuted).
By way of the surreal Garver speech, the prosecution of the initiated Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university’s freedom to investigate and seek the truth that is essential to any democratic society.
In general, it denies the right to quote credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If, in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss issues that the rich companies of this world do not like, without being subjected to repeated prosecution, who else will be able to do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have formed it if it followed the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
He has the right of reply.
The university environment to which we belong has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s exaggerated claim clearly shows that, despite what it claims, it does not have the slightest inclination to lead a transparent debate.
It’s a loss for the university world, as well as for the public debate in Canada, and it’s time for governments to put in place measures that would limit this type of unauthorized prosecution.
Operation to save Wall Street - Democrats and Republicans understand each other
Yesterday, the Bush administration and the leaders of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement on the biggest bailout since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the plan to use $700 billion to stem the financial crisis that has been brewing on Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both chambers of Congress.
In particular, it envisages: better control of the elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the payment of the public money saved, new measures to capture the number of houses seized due to non-payment, and the right to monitor the amount of wages paid to the executives of the rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative to the table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced this good news just minutes after midnight yesterday, after the two-day negotiating marathon ended.
"We have made great progress and reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets," Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said.
“Everything has been done to keep the real economy and ordinary Americans safe from the crisis that is taking place on Wall Street,” he said.
“This is a crucial point: if we don’t do this, the trauma, chaos and disruption of Americans’ daily lives will be huge,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
Over the last few hours, the negotiations have started at maximum turnarounds out of fear of the effect that another failure would have on investor sentiment.
The deadline was set for the markets to open this morning.
Both candidates for the U.S. president were invited to the negotiations later, and both expressed themselves rather for the agreement, but did not forget to express their dissatisfaction with the fact that it was necessary to resort to such a final solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has credited himself with supplementing the agreement with some measures, in particular those aimed at enabling homeowners to preserve their homes, and wage measures for state-run labor-saving companies.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures due to the irresponsibility of some people, there is nothing to congratulate on.
However, these measures are necessary," he explained on TV waves.
His Republican rival John McCain, who was asked by another station if he would vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope so."
“The rough features I’ve read [show] that it’s something that we’re all going to have to spend and use to move forward.
To choose inaction is simply unacceptable," he said.
The goal of the $700 billion plan is to buy back dubious receivables and risky and unsold assets of U.S. financial institutions for taxpayers’ money.
The plan comes after 14 months of a crisis triggered by a bubble burst in the real estate market that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (subprimes), then transferred to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA) and resulted in the freezing of cash and the breakdown of banks and financial institutions.
The collapse of the first draft of the agreement from last week is on the minds of Republican lawmakers.
From the moment the Democrats have agreed that some of the “toxic” assets of struggling companies will only be guaranteed by the government, but will not buy them, there is a belief that the situation is ablaze.
In an effort to reconcile conflicting views in Congress, measures were added that would allow the government to introduce new fees that would help it get its deposit back if it had to take over losses for five years as a result of the program.
The new plan includes a first deposit of $250 billion, to which an additional $100 billion can be added if the president deems it necessary.
A further <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>350 billion should be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the salvaged companies, which will pay him dividends in the event of a profit, and which he will be able to resell when it is over.
The federal government will be able to delay the procedures for seizing the properties associated with the loans covered by the plan, as well as set limits on the amount of valuations and compensation paid to executives of affected companies.
The plan's guardians would like to have it voted in the House of Representatives today and in the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts made, it is not yet certain whether their plan will have a green one.
Yesterday, voices continued to rise against this project, both in the republican and in the democratic camp.
"It's perfectly clear that Washington doesn't hear you," Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
However, making money on taxpayers is not the solution.”
Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen dubbed the “committee of skeptics,” presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred distinguished professors of economics, including three Nobel laureates, wrote to us: 'We ask Congress not to be in too much of a hurry and to examine carefully which way to go,'" he said.
At the same time, Europe has once again confirmed that this crisis is a world crisis.
After the extraordinary meeting, three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the banking group Fortis for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion (USD 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from the purchase of its competitor, which has been on the verge of collapse since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) due to a crisis of non-performing loans.
Fortis employs 85,000 people, is among the 20 largest European banks and among the 10 largest insurers.
"We will not lose that money," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
"In return, we gain the right to vote in the bank and influence.
And it is precisely the gardeners and households who can appreciate this in today’s uncertain time.”
On the other side of the La Manche Channel, it seems, the British government has begun to nationalize another bank affected by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which more than 41 billion (USD 75.5 billion) were loans for the purchase of real estate.
According to its announcement yesterday, branches and client accounts of the British bank will be bought by the Spanish bank Santander.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock to be nationalised by the British government since the start of the financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death socially engaged icon
His beauty with azure eyes has long represented his trump card, according to other weaknesses.
Did this American actor come out with a charming smile from narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity and unbridled talent of his own also distanced him from the power category that breeds true stars.
But what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died on Friday at the age of 83 on his Connecticut ranch from lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the fat years of American cinema.
Less magnanimous than Brando, to whom he was similar and for a long time his rival on the film screen, Newman was a more careful actor, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was of Hungarian descent.
From these European roots, one of the famous faces of the American dream was born.
Without excessive ego, which is the last sign of quality.
Because it looked at the whole country in love with self-made mana, a warrior in the war in the Pacific, wounded in a battle that in the early 1950s studied acting at Yale, then visited New York's Actor's Studio and celebrated triumph in theater, television and theater.
The same man who fought for civil rights was also an automobile racer, who placed second at the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, and at the same time a sexual symbol, despite having formed a model couple with actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
It also takes away the shadowy places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the whims of his own show-business, which will forever remain a mystery to some extent.
A good man, in the highest sense of the word.
The departure of Paul Newman this weekend has caused a stir for film lovers, while his big roles compete together on a black canvas of memories.
After him, he parades for more than half a century the ever-changing American seventh art.
A charming cowboy emerges from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), a young man who rejects his sensuous wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Burnt Roof, a 1958 Tennessee Williams adaptation.
From the less distant past (1990) we remember his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled at an advanced age by marriage that did not meet all expectations.
So many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, a battered, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Somebody Up There Likes Me by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, taken after his death, which Newman made real acquaintance in 1956.
A sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting (Podraz), Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiards player in Robert Rossen's The Hustler (1961), the same character will appear in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, bringing him the only Oscar in 1987 out of seven nominations.
This face of a traveling age, it was him.
And him again.
In his professional career, different eras compete with each other.
He is best known for the iconic George Roy Hill Slap Shot (1977) from the role of Reggie Dunlop, an unconventional hockey coach.
Fans met him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
He ended his career as the Irish mob boss in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003.
Unlike a few movie legends who pretty soon left the craft, Newman remained in the industry for a long time, though he did condemn Hollywood for its gilded, ostentatiousness and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, not without humor, considered it "a lively challenge of underplaying", judging that in his performances he pushed too much on the saw.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, to whom the roles came as a tray, the profession was not always so tender.
However, the first lovers played less often than the outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, rags and despair, whose decline and rebellion reflected in his perfect features.
As a director, Newman revealed little-known pages of his shy sensibilities.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, features a sensitive female portrait full of melancholy.
His son Scott, whom he lost due to an overdose, was given the 1984 film Harry and Son, a work full of shame and sadness.
In a tribute to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former co-star Robert Redford (played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) lamented, "His presence has made my life and this country better."
Generosity, love of life, these are the main characteristics of the deceased actor.
Aside from his legendary career, there is also a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, an independent film, an opponent of the decline of Hollywood.
We used to see his likeness on bottles of wine vinegar, sauces, cookies and other foods, which we thought might be rather distasteful, although at first it was a gag.
However, profits from the sale went to the account of his Foundation for Heavy Childhood.
Thus, rather than let himself be swayed by glory, Newman was engaged in society until the last moment.
He left a letter to his five daughters that read: “Always and to the end, your father was grateful to his happy planet.
It was an honor to have been here.”
And it was an honor for us to be able to follow the life path of such a bright-eyed and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the factory for invoices Zuschlag & spol.?
Soon, on October 8th, the trial of J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
In addition to other crimes, including forgery of documents, the politician and his associates are accused of fraud committed by long-term and systematic criminal organizations, as a result of which extremely significant damage has been caused.
According to the prosecutor's office, they used the money obtained in public competitions for their own purposes and often proved the fulfillment of tasks by fictitious invoices.
Money from the state and local governments – a total of about 65 million forints – was partly spent in the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly in the pockets of individuals.
The manner in which the investigating authority was also informed was that the money obtained in the public tenders was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no actual counter-value, and the commitments accepted were never received by the association.
According to the prosecution, most of the invoices were fake.
Prints for these invoices came from the J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros market, round stamps were made in Kiskunhalasi.
Among other things, it was decided on the names of the companies on which the production of invoices is to take place on the circular route along the northern bank of Balaton, to which Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Ladose J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag sent.
According to his testimony, he was first appointed to look out for boarding houses and restaurants.
In them, he applied for accounts for his consumption, according to the model of which invoices were then produced within the framework of public competitions issued, among others, by the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, respectively, the Municipality of the capital.
Invoices were mostly issued by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados with his partner Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>rim, who, according to our information, most often wrote the reports needed to obtain subsidies.
During his "study trip", Lados looked out at one of the pubs.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and his associates in 2003, this catering establishment provided catering for a 90-member group from Biztos Pont.
However, according to the head of the company, so many people would not suddenly enter this facility.
In the same way, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 by the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt and Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, was fraught with formal and content errors.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomaji had only three rooms, more than ten people could not sleep in it one evening, yet one hundred and thirty guests were listed on the invoice.
However, printers with a rich imagination exceeded this even when they mentioned on the documents a company also engaged in hospitality - Pigal s. r. o., in whose accounting according to the information provided to the State Prosecutor's Office documents sounding on the name Jobp J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>figurt and not.
The head of the company Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas for hvg.hu said that when he was called to the prosecutor's office and showed him invoices, he immediately knew that they were fake documents.
"The name of our company and our tax number were on the stamp in the wrong place."
In addition to the formality, he added, there was also a disagreement that according to the invoice there were a hundred people, because they only have eleven rooms, which do not have such a large capacity.
In addition, the invoice also included meals, and their restaurant has not been functioning for a long time.
The eager manufacturers of invoices were also not convinced that the planned Budapest travel agency organizes only foreign trips, and on the invoice with payment in cash, which also did not agree with the invoicing practice of the company, they mentioned p<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>etile as a service of mediation of the trip to Hungary.
In addition, as it emerged during the investigation, the document also stated VAT, although the organization of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
On four documents issued by Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation by Hotel Révf<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xB6>p s. r. o., the company did not agree on the amount of VAT. The company’s activities are not covered by the mentioned 25%, but by the 15% VAT.
In addition, the "issuers" ruined the invoice, for example, by stating to one company how it was revealed thanks to the investigation of the public prosecutor's office, as the carried out activity of road transport of goods, which the company originally founded on investment advice did not carry out.
The fact that invoices issued by the Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt Foundation and Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért and the associations XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>lis Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let and Biztos Pont are false, has also failed due to formal deviations - the incorrect format of the invoice and the wrong stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Sports Camp in Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3>, whose representatives denied that they would issue invoices.
For example, the counterfeiters did not even notice that the company HIB s. r. o. from Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za was in liquidation at the time (2001), when a group from the association Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért was eating there, which is why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company also denied that he would issue the paper.
Invoices were issued knowingly
The second group of invoicing consists of those who knew that they were to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Eséla Budapestért Foundation has issued accounts for approximately four million forints for the Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Foundation at the request of the organization Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k.
According to the indictment, the head of Collab s. r. o. had one of the accused Ludovic Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rfi set up a fictitious account.
Biogate s.r.o. also cooperated with Zuschlag and its partners, currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation and the Atlasz and V<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>sfeny<0xC5><0x91> associations with invoices worth approximately five million forints, beyond which there was no actual economic activity.
Nor the movement of money, because the created invoices were later canceled, which, however, the organizations forgot to mention in their documents.
Another group of invoicing companies includes those who had ties to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was an authorized representative of the Ukrainian Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> s. r. o., a company engaged in the trade in fuels and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, where the company is not available.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several invoices for the sale of computing equipment worth approximately 18 million forints.
According to the data found by the investigation, these invoices were purchased by Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment s. r. o., which has been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a man from Romania, to whom in 2002-2005 he was to hand over the documents relating to the company also Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n Kubatov.
As we know, Kubatov admitted during the investigation that on behalf of the company he issued invoices to the Atlasz, Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> and Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt Foundation and Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért and himself accepted their counter-value.
At the request of Ivan Kubatov, Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s. r. o. and Jos-Investment k. s. were founded by Romanian masons.
In fact, none of the companies worked, according to the defendant, because they did not get a job.
Nevertheless, the companies were in his favor, because at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, who also prepared their founding documents, he issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the Atlasz and Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3>n associations connected to Zuschlag.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov gave organizations a total of 15 invoices worth 14.2 million forints.
The state prosecutor’s office decided that Kubatov came to 10 percent of the amounts indicated on invoices and VAT.
To issue fictitious invoices, this time for the selection procedure for Biztos Pont, the man also used the company Szi-Beri k.t.
In January 2006, the Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3> and Sz<0xC3><0xB6>vetség and Modern Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért submitted proposals for the Mih<0xC3><0xA1>lye T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsicse Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organization of the Socialist Party, to the public competition.
They received 500,000 forints, but did not spend the amounts on the targets set out in the proposals.
In order not to reveal this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team s. r. o.
These invoices were found during a home inspection in the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants will probably describe the course of the production of invoices, as she has already done at the prosecutor's office.
It may be more interesting if the main defendant J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag decides to reveal everything himself.
His statement so far is not very detailed, and although he has promised several times that he will explain everything extensively, he has not yet done so.
The question is whether it is in his interest - in exchange for the payment of a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, with which perhaps the Socialists have concluded an agreement, and Zussi will take it upon himself.
He could have been offended, for his requests to ease the conditions of his detention, namely, to place him in a home prison, have not yet been heard.
While perpetrators of economic crimes, who have committed much greater damage than they have yet to pay, can walk freely, or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have this option.
The psychology of trumping: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overvalue the goods.
The neurological and economic foundations of this well-known – and seemingly irrational – behavior have been uncovered by researchers in the field of neurology and economics at New York University.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people don’t want to be left behind in an eBay auction, so they’d rather pay too high a price.
Research with the help of an experimental auction tried to map the scheme of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group took part in the auction, using the method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study the active areas of the brain of experimental subjects.
In both games, the participants could win money, but in the auction game, an important element of which is to trump the other side, the whole under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, began to work intensively when losing.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the "self-rewarding" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to the researchers, the price screwing can therefore be explained by the effort to avoid a sharp reaction of the striata.
To support their theory, members of the research team among economists conducted a financial cross-sectional survey.
Under different conditions, three groups were bidding against one partner.
The control group was simply told what the fair value of the product was, and they made the bets.
In addition, members of the other group were promised that if they exit the game, they would receive an additional $15 for the reward.
The third group, on the other hand, received $15 before the auction, but in the event of a loss, its members also lost this money.
The difference between the two groups, therefore, consisted in the fact that one was emphasized as a win and the other as a loss.
The members of the group playing "against loss" were, however, willing to go higher than it was in the control and "winning" group, which confirms the hypothesis of neurologists.
"These results cannot be deduced from any previously existing economic theory.
In fact, they have so far explained the phenomena observed in auctioning joys of victory and avoiding risk.
Until neurological imaging methods helped us to resolve the contradiction between these two theories so that we now have a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: when to see a doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, this chronic liver disease is listed among the leading causes of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand of them are treated. The reason for this is that patients often do not know that they are infected.
The name hepatitis is a generic name for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms there are many similarities, the inflammation of the liver and jaundice is symptomatic, but the causes of the disease and the diseases caused by them differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main ways depending on the origin of the disease: hepatitis type A and E by the digestive system (for example, by infected food, water), hepatitis type B, C, D and other blood and body fluid viruses (sperm, vaginal secretions).
Travelers should in any case protect themselves by vaccination against virus A and B, there is no vaccine against virus type C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after ingestion of an infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, urge to vomit.
Then on the skin and the whites of the eyes, a jaundice, a lighted stool and dark urine are formed. The treatment can take up to two to three weeks.
Every year, one million people worldwide die from a more serious type of the disease, liver cancer and liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that it is estimated that only one in ten infected people is treated with medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if not treated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most of the infected do not even know about their disease, the origin of the disease destroys the liver cells inadvertently, and so the first symptoms appear in many cases in 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent early, conduct regular screening.
In three groups, this disease occurs much more often than on average: among people who had had a blood transfusion before 1991, among drug users, and among people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated worldwide number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
Since the disease can be demonstrated by a routine laboratory examination, a person should contact his/her doctor if he/she experiences any symptom of unknown origin.
With early detection, the disease is curable, the virus can be removed from the body, thus preventing the spread of the infection and preventing the formation of cancer.
September 30 is the World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized by organizations representing the sick worldwide in 2004.
Its aim is to draw attention to the chronic inflammation of the liver caused by these viruses, the causes of its formation and the importance of early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God, doesn’t it hurt so much?
According to the results of recent research, faith in God works as a certain analgesic, which could alleviate the death of already Catholic martyrs.
Scientists from the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, exploring how faith in the god of pain affects a person, the British newspaper Telegraph reported.
As part of a rather bizarre survey, 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks, while all observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude a large part of the pain.
Thanks to the technique, a detailed examination of the human brain showed that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
The research is the first in a series of studies involving academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians from different parts of the university.
The exact test was carried out by attaching a flashing instrument to the left hand of the test subject, which emitted electric shocks.
The researchers asked the participants to observe two paintings: the 17th-century Sassoferrat’s Virgin Mary and the 15th-century Leonardo da Vinci’s Lady with a crossbow, painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the research hoped that looking at the Virgin Mary would bring about a certain state of piety in the faithful, while da Vinci’s painting was chosen because it was not very different from the first and seemed to them a calming impression.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner and during this time received 20 electroshocks in four successive parts, while separately watching the image with a religious or general theme.
Catholics said that when they looked at the Virgin Mary, they felt "safe," as if they were "taken care of" and "calm down, they were filled with peace."
When watching a religiously-themed painting, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the research, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with the help of any highly impressive image even among atheists, just need to find the right photo.
"We would have to find a picture that they would perceive very positively, from the position of a mother or father," the psychologist said.
The Bishop of England, Tom Wright, welcomed the results.
"Practicing faith should change, and in many cases it will also change our personality," Wright said.
After such great results, it is only a question of what effect it would have on the regulation of the pain of believers if they were shown some madonna by Leonard or a painter of a similar caliber.
Would looking at the quality of the Virgin Mary mean achieving even better results?
You are what you share with yourself.
On his 10th birthday, Google can state that people can find him in their pocket at least as well as in the sky above their heads; they know where they have been on vacation, what professional examinations are going on and what interests them.
According to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s CEOs, that’s still not enough.
However, as far as skeptics are concerned, paralleling Orwellian dark vision, the very essence of Web 2.0 is not clear to them.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary for Google’s founders to stick to their original plan, which was, “Let’s organize all the information in the world!”
According to the alleged representative of Google, even after ten years of world-class work, the company is only at the beginning to be able to work with all the information.
When asked what would happen in five years’ time, Schmidt said he would like Google to be able to answer questions such as “what should I do tomorrow?” or “what kind of work would be appropriate for me?”—but such seemingly simple questions will not be answered by the software until the end.
Not all Internet users are well aware that search terms are accurately captured during the Internet search, including what IP address was searched from and to which pages the searchers have moved.
For example, thanks to Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can keep a history of their browsing, they can look back at what they were looking for and what they clicked on, which then in the long run generates findings adapted much more directly to them - based on the same logic, and the Recommences service will be based on the same
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I do? - ask users who are afraid when looking at the data monopoly Google.
In most cases, the scale of the potential power represented by the company is more threatening, the counter-reaction does not evoke in Internet users the awareness of guilt, fear of punishment, the desire for freedom or even rebellion against power.
However, it is a confirmed fact that all the searched terms are not only captured, but in justified cases they can also be issued to a third party, in such legal cases the personal rights of Internet users do not protect anything.
The most famous example of this has been a recent coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that enabled the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community sites established through it.
However, internet users who are concerned about personal rights could still take a breather in May when the company, hand in hand with the electronic rights organization EFF, successfully proved its truth in a dispute with the FBI: so Google must not be forced to provide any information in the future by any article of the Constitution.
(At the same time, the federal government has successfully collected almost fifty thousand web addresses and thousands of search terms, which it obtained with reference to the reinforcement of the adopted law on the protection of children, yet it has failed to obtain lists of searchable web items of individuals.
The view on Google is so contradictory: it is being whipped by those who are afraid to provide their personal data, because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life will be by starting to use Google services, exposed to harm, and acting against it with a revolt against what the image belongs to multinational companies with conservatism.
And so far, American geek culture and its wild gang, grouping around themselves enthusiastic computer fans, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees in it a new generation of bigots, a "corporation that is now buzzing", unlike its rival Microsoft, considered to be the conqueror of the world because of Windows.
This may be due to the fact that Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require an identification code from its users and does not want money for their applications; an open, free and constantly fresh source of information and a package of programs acts as a much more accessible, younger, "cooler" than the practice of official software development.
However, this can also be due to the fact that geeks precisely understand the very problematic relationship between the Internet and personality rights, which has brought with it one of the most favorable keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about nothing but cooperation, about deliberately leaving traces and using the communication channels that we have available, and although their scope is different for everyone, the essence remains the same: we show ourselves.
The average young person can keep a profile right on several community sites from Facebook to Xang, which he can easily link to other services, for example, Twitter or the last.fm application, recording the music he listens to, all of which can be connected to navigation systems such as FriendFed, Google+ or Google+.
At the same time, we can learn about a lot of exemplary cases, from which it emerges: a friend in the morning, looking at the flood of photos of mutual friends, easily comes to terms with who her shabby friend spent the evening with, or the company can throw out his employee only because on his blog he expresses his sincere intentions:
One who lives an online life is made up of what is self-evident, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today’s youth.
And if you want to hide something or at least avoid the Google monopoly, you have the option (starting with Scroogle, which uses Google’s search engine, but does not intentionally leave a trace).
For example, a small number of people do not register on community sites, so that they cannot be found. Online Google applications from text editor to photo editor and news portal can be exchanged for alternative versions that are not connected to a huge server park and that do not create the highest quality profile possible.
Public opinion is not too secretive when Google shows its teeth.
With its current value of $156 billion higher than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion), or Coca-Cola ($110 billion), Adwords/AdSense ad space is threatening advertising agency investment and services being introduced at an ever-accelerating pace.
Critics, however, also find the counterpoints of the 2006 apprehension to the apprehension of the government: the top management, for example, completely rejected the protests of the employees after they raised the company's school fees to double, and the daily meals of the employees were, according to the company's management, all of them.
One of the company’s internal rules is that it never advertises new services in advance, it only predates them when it can be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the coming months and years can be avoided by the world in new places: while some believe that the Google project is aimed at archiving, it is not going to be able to do anything to archive them.
The fact that Google builds a genetic database, then it can serve as a good starting material for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the famous novel by Cory Doctorowa "Scroogled" describes with Orwellian reminiscences a future in which one can approach a person frighteningly well only with the help of data from Goo.
The double killer from <0xC3><0x93>zd helped to remove the traces of two teenagers
Two juveniles were questioned by police in the case of a double murder in <0xC3><0x93>zd, according to reasonable suspicion, helped to remove the traces of this crime, said on Tuesday a spokesman for the Supreme Police Directorate of the county of Borsod.
The persons have become aware of the activity from which they were suspected and are currently accused of aiding the crime.
Both juveniles, according to the information of MTI two girls, are being prosecuted in freedom.
Assistance to a criminal offence shall be punishable by deprivation of liberty for a period of up to 5 years.
Suspected of a double murder in <0xC3><0x96>zd, a 23-year-old man, was taken into temporary custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect in a pre-planned multiple homicide for obvious reasons.
During the investigation, it was revealed that a 23-year-old young man owed a 53-year-old man a larger amount.
The suspect did not want to pay off his debt, so he lured his creditor to a factory in <0xC3><0x96>zd last Wednesday, where he first killed a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to MTI, the young man was preparing in advance for the crime, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the scene of the crime.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
Warsaw Stock Exchange Makes Offer to Buy Prague Stock Exchange
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - were offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100% share package of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwig Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of possible new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the owner of the Warsaw Stock Exchange is the state.
99 percent of the shares are held by the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of the securities in a few months.
According to the Czech economic daily E15, the offer of Poles is the highest amount that has been offered to the Prague stock exchange so far.
According to Czech papers, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche B<0xC3><0xB6>rse have so far made an offer.
Petr Koblic, head of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all interested parties, and did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
The value of the Prague Stock Exchange is estimated by stock market experts at 5-10 billion.
According to the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold off.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25 percent share, followed by <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis from the point of view of the European Charter
In their Tuesday comments on the deepening international financial crisis, the leading European newspapers already recall "the second of September 11".
We can thank the American president for the global financial disaster, the accusation of the Roman La Repubblica is made. The president was not even able to shake up his own side in support of that hastily paid bill, which is aimed at remedying this desperate situation...
Instead of the new Pearl Harbor, which was reminiscent of billionaire and investor Warren Buffett, we could talk about the second 9/11.
Also part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington.
According to the daily El Mundo, it has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse due to a lack of political leadership.
The danger of the collapse of the US financial system is constantly growing, for which the whole world will eventually pay.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the vote in Congress, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political solution to the crisis.
The world economy hangs in the air - just as one of the greatest changes in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, according to the Geneva-based daily Tages-Anzeiger.
Individual states can still throw a lifeline at revolving money institutions, and taxpayers can save them from collapse.
However, if other banks collapse like dominoes, then neither money nor other improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to move through their national egoism and unify control over fragmented financial markets.
More than 100 billion euros were received by postponing monetary institutions on Monday alone, recalls the Vienna-based Der Standard, which fears that, like Americans, European taxpayers will have to dig deep into their pockets to deal with the crisis, even more realistically.
The European Union has so far not taken seriously the crisis that is spreading across the old continent like a tsunami.
The "saviours" do not have to immediately wave in the billions of euros, but it would be good if they firmly established in which case it is reasonable to reach for the taxpayers' money in order to prevent even greater damage.
Intelligent car mimics the flight of a bumblebee
What would be the best method of developing technologies capable of preventing collisions, if not imitating the detectors of obstacles occurring in the world of nature?
For example, bees.
The initial strategic idea of the surprising project, presented at the Japanese CEATEC fair, was to introduce engineers from the company Nissan <0xC5><0x8C>mel<0xC3><0xA1>ci. It was about how to build a new generation of systems to prevent crashes.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has designed a biomimetic robotic control system of the BR23C type, a robotic mini-car equipped with bee features, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
“During the flight, each bee creates its own personal oval-shaped space, which is actually very similar to our security protective packaging,” said Kazuhiro Doi, the brand’s director general for technology PR and R&D.
An important role is played by the compound eyes, which allow the bees to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees.
Engineers used the idea of a laser rangefinder to copy the function of the compound eye.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 metres ahead of the BR23C in the 180-degree field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately transforms into an operation aimed at preventing a collision.
The obstacle is caught within a fraction of a second, then the robotic car begins to imitate the movements of the bees and by turning the wheels in the range necessary to prevent a collision immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this maneuver is carried out in a completely instinctive way.
"If this were not the case, the robotic car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," explains Toshijuki Ando, head of the Mobility Laboratory and Robotic Car Project.
They need to respond instinctively and immediately, as this technology fits the most vulnerable and innermost layer of security packaging, within which a crash is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what the bee is doing to avoid the other bees.
This process should not take longer than the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, this movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and only in the direction in which the wheels can be rotated.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to bees when avoiding, only the possibility of rotating, accelerating and slowing down was applied in the case of a robotic car.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer life than lithium-ion variants.
According to Andoa, instinctive, intelligent responses are important, not the ability to process, let alone store data.
This mechanism must process and respond to only a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need to store and respond to them using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it constantly uses only memory of a few kilobytes in size.
It does not require memory with a gigabyte or megabyte capacity.
This is the first step in the development of an immediate-avoidance technology that Nissan estimates could reach mass-produced cars within a decade.
Another option of application may be to connect the unit to the GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding obstacles in the way, would lead the motorist to the specified final destination.
Damned expensive baby already has a name
The $700 billion bailout bill, which is to be split into several installments and is aimed at buying out poor-quality bank loans, is already in writing.
Half of the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations, which ended only on Saturday after midnight of U.S. Eastern Time, congressional representatives reached an agreement in a few days to debate a $700 billion bailout package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, who said only the signing of the agreement remained.
The compromise on the package was also backed by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Finance Minister Henry Paulson said of the compromise outcome: “The programme will work and be effective, but further steps need to be taken.”
The written version of the package was published before the opening of Asian markets on Sunday at 8 p.m. Washington time (that is, on Monday at 2 a.m. Central European time), but it did not cause any special rise on the exchanges.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote on the draft legal standard, named after the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which is to be established by the program, and then it will be a matter for the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday evening, after reports of the deal were also welcomed at the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress made last night and appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said in a statement.
After all, the program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal that a total of $700 billion should be spent on the purchase of low-quality securities secured by mortgages at once.
Now it is possible to spend a maximum of $700 billion in the first half, in such a way that $250 billion will be used immediately after the matter is expected to be decided by Congress on Monday, and the Ministry of Finance will buy for them securities secured by mortgages, which are valued as low-quality, the fate of the president will be decided by 100 percent.
The program will be controlled by a special corps, of which the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank will also be a member.
Spending the second half of $700 billion will depend on the next decision of Congress.
In the sense of the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy off low-quality loans, mortgages and securities secured by mortgages, or other "poisonous" loans.
Purchases can be made within the framework of auctions and directly, the competent representatives of the Ministry said.
The legal standard will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme in which the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee on the funds representing a cause for concern, for which the companies will pay a price corresponding to the amount of the expected damages.
As Henry Paulson said, the law provides the necessary means to spend up to $700 billion to meet the urgent requirements of the U.S. financial system, whether it is a large purchase of bad assets, their insurance, or preventing the systemic risk associated with the collapse of some of the assets.
"We will take the necessary steps to be prepared to introduce the law as soon as it is signed," he added.
On the contrary, the heads of banks who are in trouble and waiting for the help of the state can count on the government to reduce their apostasy - which is simply called a "golden parachute" in the offshore slang.
Their payment will only be limited in certain cases, in addition, these restrictions will depend on the method of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction basically means that if the Ministry buys in the auction, a tax surcharge will be imposed on the golden parachutes, if the fallen bank directors are not sent straight to retirement.
In the case of a direct purchase of low-quality loans, the government will take aggressive steps in order to ensure that the money for the management is not exaggerated.
It should be added that existing contracts on gold parachutes will not be changed, the restriction only applies to new contracts, which is intended to be another incentive to participate in the programme.
“This is the first time in American history that a statutory cap on the remuneration of CEOs will be in force,” said House Financial Services Committee Chairman Barney Frank.
In addition, the state will have the right to obtain a share in the participating banks, thereby reducing the risk of taxpayers, since once the economy and the saved bank are on their feet, they can also make a profit on this transaction.
The proposal plan states that over the next five years, the president must submit a proposal to Congress to determine how the expected losses from the financial sector can be repaid to taxpayers.
On both sides, of course, there were voices in connection with the plan of doubt.
"This is not what the U.S. citizens have asked us to do, this is not going to protect taxpayer dollars," Darrell Issa, a Republican from California, said.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, judges that the adoption of the provision was urged by precisely those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0.1 per cent in August 2008 compared to the previous month, compared to 12.9 per cent in August 2007, the Central Statistical Office announced.
Export sales prices in the industry were up 1.1 percent year-on-year compared to July 2008, down 3.9 percent year-on-year.
As a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 per cent compared to the previous month, increasing by 3.2 per cent year-on-year.
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by only a minimum of 0.1 percent compared to the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sectors also rose slightly, by 0.1 per cent, compared to July.
The largest increase in prices occurred in August 2008 in the leather and footwear industry (2.8 per cent), mainly due to an inter-monthly increase in prices in the manufacture of handbags and saddlery products by 4.6 per cent, respectively, and shoe production by 2.5 per cent.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly price increase in the chemical materials and products production sector (1.6%).
The decrease in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4 percent), the production of electric machines and appliances (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum - in the woodworking sector (0.1 percent).
Prices in the field of paper production and publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, we measured price increases in the range of 0.2 - 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sector, which is of great importance to the domestic sales of the industry, prices rose by 0.3 percent in August, mainly due to the continuing impact of the officially determined increase in gas prices from 1 July.
In the twelve-month comparison of domestic sales in individual sectors of the processing industry, prices rose the most in the professional oil processing sector (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking industry it was possible to observe 13,2 percent, in the production of food products, beverages and tobacco products, which has a decisive weight, then 11 percent price increase.
The decrease in prices occurred in the textile and textile products (2.5 per cent) and electrical machinery and appliances (0.3 per cent).
In other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price growth was between 0.6 and 9.1 per cent.
Overall, prices in the manufacturing sector rose by 10.2 per cent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sector exceeded the prices of the previous year by 18.7 per cent.
In terms of segmentation by sector focus, domestic sales in August showed the highest monthly price increase (0,7 per cent) in the material asset production sectors.
In the sectors producing consumer goods, prices rose by 0.3 per cent, in the energy processing and further processing sectors, prices did not change compared to the previous month.
The largest increase in prices compared to the same month of the previous year was observed in the energy processing and further processing sectors (16.8%) in August 2008.
In the sectors producing consumer goods, we measured a price increase of 6.8 percent, while in the case of tangible assets, we measured a price decrease of 1.4 percent.
Export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1 percent in August compared to the previous month, down by 3.9 percent in a 12-month comparison.
Our domestic payment decreased by 1.7 per cent against the euro in one month, by 7.1 per cent against the dollar, compared with 7.5 per cent against the euro in August 2007 and by 15.9 per cent against the dollar.
Next year in the United States without a visa?
According to Kinga G<0xC3><0xB6>nchov<0xC3><0xA1>, there is great hope that the US-Hungary visa-free travel agreement will enter into force around January 12, the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her opinion, "almost everything now depends only on the timely construction of an electronic system for permitting travel, or checks, at sea".
At the same time, she warned that part of the new system will not be allowed to enter, but tourists will have to register before departure.
The representative of Hungarian diplomacy continues to hold talks in Washington from today.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Central Cross to the Order of Merit for the Republic of Hungary, and hold talks with foreign policy advisers to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of a bank bailout.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of both major US parties, agreed on Sunday to support a $700 billion government bailout package for banks, but there are also politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
After several days of a marathon of congressional and administrative meetings, it was announced early on Sunday morning: a basic agreement was reached on a bailout package for banks.
The financial package, which aims to bridge the Wall Street crisis and the frozen credit market, has become a central issue of the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain have consistently called themselves the most suitable of the two candidates to take the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, along with how they got to the forefront of economic issues, Obama once again gained some advantage and McCain’s lead vanished, which he secured after the Republican convention’s nomination of Sarah Palin as vice president.
Obama expressed hope at a pre-election rally in Detroit on Sunday that the $700 billion package bill would be quickly passed by Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages relating to consumer protection, which he also supports.
"We must act now, responsibly ... to your places, to your savings, to the whole industry, to the stability of the whole economy, there is danger," he told the crowd of 35,000.
He didn’t miss an opportunity to call McCain’s ideas about the economy obsolete.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said: "It's going to be a little bit of a struggle... but doing nothing is just not a possible path."
As stated by the Republican Senator, the proposal includes the establishment of a commission overseeing the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the adjournment for senior representatives, on which it persisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play a more important role in the negotiations, he was himself in daily contact with the minister.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Print overview of the German language area
The right-wing camp is unbroken, only voters inside it have become more self-confident - so analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are prepared to rule Austria to prevent a red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In an online edition of the left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter discusses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Father".
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
Christian socialists have been rebuilding Bavaria for decades – and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The alternation of the period is a problem of the whole Christian democracy, and thus of Angela Merkel.
The debacle was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but on Saturday the process ended, which could have been predicted for almost exactly ten years: the undisputed hegemony of one state party ended.
Already ten years ago, in 1998, CSU landed at 47.7 percent, for the first time since the 1950s below the 50 percent limit.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, in the Stoiber period, which is so often mentioned.
The reason is the modernization that CSU has consistently carried out in this country and that it is devouring its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have made a lot of mistakes at a rapid pace. However, the secularization, the results of education, the resettlement of Germans from the east and from the north in the developing regions of Bavaria could not be without consequences on the loyalty of CSU voters.
Modernization is associated with the growth of possibilities, which also has visible political consequences.
The right-wing camp is unbroken, only the voters inside it have become more self-confident, more critical, more self-willed.
It is also obvious that in recent weeks the CSU has been the most distant from the classical civil strata; people in the liberal profession, tradesmen, individuals with a degree and with a university education.
By now, CSU support has shrunk below 40 percent.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese daily, in its article entitled "Who, with whom? The presidents of the parties are restrained in the questions of the coalition", devotes itself to the confused internal political situation that arose as a result of the Austrian elections.
SP<0xC3><0x96> wishes to negotiate with <0xC3><0x96>VP.
<0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the interference of the SP<0xC3><0x96> in its internal affairs.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> seems open to all negotiations, the Greens do not want to negotiate on the coalition yet.
The elections are behind us, now everything is about the coalition; in the debate held on public television, the presidents of the parties did not have much to look at their cards.
SP<0xC3><0x96> President Werner Faymann confirmed his desire to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
And the SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is certainly possible - it exists in some federal countries and in the social partnership.
The question of whether he could imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current <0xC3><0x96>VP president, as Vice-Chancellor, was left open by Faymann.
As he put it, the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ssel-Molterer course was oversold for every fall.
The repetition of this direction is not taken into account.
Molterer responded to the red offers cautiously.
As he said, the cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition is so far completely open in the party, these issues need to be discussed decisively within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
BZ<0xC3><0x96> President J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider again appeared open in all directions.
"To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibilities," Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1>: It is necessary to break the vicious circle of poverty and segregation
In Paris today, the European Equality Summit, which this year is hosted by France, the current President of the European Union.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, a member of the European People's Party for the Fidesz movement, as one of the main speakers of the expert debate in her message addressed to the plenary, drew attention to segregation in education, as it is one of the most serious injustices affecting Romani children, and also their most serious offense.
The summit was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC5><0xA0>pidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by invited representatives of governments, European social partners, the most important European rights organisations and civil society organisations working in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the group of MEPs, Fidesz J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1> pointed out that in addition to the discrimination that occurs in the recruitment of labour, Roma are expelled from the European labour market mainly due to their low education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have a high school education and, due to the poor quality of basic education, only a small part of them can achieve a higher level of education."
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1> also stressed that education as a fundamental human right plays a key role in the implementation of other human rights.
Investing in the early education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to establish awareness of these contexts in the widest circles - between Roma and non-Romani children.
The sooner a Roma student starts school, the greater the chance of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through income taxes and excise taxes they contribute to the national budget.
"The right of the Roma to their European Union citizenship is necessary to ensure the right to quality education and to guarantee the elimination of their poor quality and separate education," said Livia J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
According to the honourable Member, the coherence of the European Union, with an emphasis on the objective and the negotiations, is needed in order to speed up the desegregation processes of schools immediately, and it is important, first of all, that the existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations are properly adhered to.
"We need to break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we need to provide Roma children with the opportunities given by democratic space so that they can participate as full citizens in the future of Europe," J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
In the spirit of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", the aim of the European Equality Summit, held annually since last year's meeting in Berlin, is to provide a separate forum to help achieve the objectives of equality and eliminate discrimination, set at the level of the whole of Europe and of individual Member States.
CSU: Temporary Grace
The fate of the incumbent duo Huber-Beckstein will be decided at the end of October
Despite the shameful election debate, the debate on personal issues has not yet been held, and the Bavarian CSU has so far postponed the debate.
Party President Erwin Huber and Earth Prime Minister G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Beckstein can still remain in their seats, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes, will be decided last October by the extraordinary congress of the party.
The members of the highly criticized duo, in any case, have been told that they will not be able to stand up for themselves in their posts.
They tried to calm the angry members of the faction and the base, who, due to the loss of an absolute majority, demanded a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" to bring about personal consequences.
Five years ago - it is true, still under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, who is at the top of her career - the Christian Social Union gained 60.7 percent, now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, but its strength was only 43.4 percent.
In Bavaria, CSU produced 18 percent of Germany’s GDP “self-ruled” for 46 years.
Although conservatives in the southern federal state, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, still hold a high position, they will be forced into a coalition in the future anyway.
One of the first signs of reorganisation within the party is the fact that a member of a narrow intelligence team, which will start the probing negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, respectively with the right-wing Free Voters, will also be the Vice-President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture.
It is ironic that Gabriele Pauli, whose speech against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out the coup, entered the chamber on the candidate of the Free Voters, but then with an ambitious municipal policy they made a ruthlessly short process.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energy on how to stabilize Beckstein.
During the transition period, Stoiber, who has so far pulled the strings from the background, called September 28 the saddest day of his political career by the former Prime Minister and former President of the CSU.
On Monday, Huber sent several stinging remarks to the CDU, saying they would have deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor unless the CSU, which played an important role in the national success in 2005, somehow puts itself on its feet together.
According to Merkel, who had difficulty hiding her disappointment due to the failure, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which, of course, is relative: treating the wounded CSU will not be easier and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD achieved its weakest result since 1946 with 18.6 per cent in Bavaria.
Lukashenko:opposition - 110:0
Not a single member of the opposition has been elected to the Belarusian parliament in Sunday's elections.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the welfare and stability of the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), by the illegalities that occurred during the vote count.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of a country of 10 million has lacked opposition for well over a decade, the opposition, united several times under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) before yesterday's elections, had seriously hoped that Lukashenko, who had left on the basis of a change of constitution in elections with a debatable margin to re-elect the president in 2006.
The ODS has also abandoned the previously considered boycott.
Against the background of the opposition’s expectation, the economic dependence on Russia became increasingly dependent on the political establishment of Belarus – which, in order to mitigate the impact of Russia’s ever-increasing import of natural gas, took credit and also contributed to Beltransgaz, the owner of the gas pipelines passing through the country, getting in touch with the Russians.
The release earlier pointed out that the OSCE in the evaluation of the pre-election campaign emphasized positive shifts, and not shortcomings - for example, a ban on candidacy for a third of opposition candidates.
Monday’s OSCE flash report, however, already had reservations about a campaign during which opposition candidates were essentially unable to appear in the press, especially the fact that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
At the same time, according to the opposition, there is an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released, and Minsk is willing to engage with Moscow in smaller confrontations, if it continues to refuse to recognize Georgia as a separate South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though it is a part of Russia.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has started," Milinkevi<0xC4><0x8D> told our newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate from the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that it remains so, despite the fact that "it is too afraid to let a single member of the opposition into the insignificant parliament".
Looking at the results of the opposition, he does not plan protests, rather he tries to deliver his message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print the opposition sheets in Russia, the distribution is supported by the obstacles of the local authorities, but I see that more and more people are supporting the change, even among the elderly," Milinkevich said, noting that the Lukashenko regime is not making the most of its efforts.
"Due to the country's indebtedness and the growth of the trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the social security that 'induces the silence of the cemetery' collapses," Milinkevi<0xC4><0x8D> said.
In contrast to opposition politics, Russian observers viewed the election as democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, the head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, told Russian news agency Ria Novosti that "people do not believe in words, but in actions", so the absence of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It is the first time in the history of the Chigi Palace that rotating doors have been introduced on arrival and departure of employees.
But as of today, this new measure will work against the people who are smeared, against those who push themselves and then go to coffee at work.
The news against sloths was announced today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renat Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Maurem Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool for better work, higher performance, more presences and more services," the minister said.
"A new era of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is reformism," Brunetta said.
With the Chigi Palace, we will complete the implementation of the Presidency of the Council in all buildings.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections on the part of the employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a joint procedure with the workers and the cooperation of all."
In short, no more breakfast at work; no more coffee and croissant.
Brunetta smiles and says, “There’s nothing better than a decent cappuccino at seven in the morning.”
During a conference at the Higher Vocational School for Public Administration
In Rome, the minister will finally announce that within three months the absence of public employees for the disease has decreased by 50%, that is, by 60,000 more people per year at work.
And he adds that it is necessary for the Italian public administration to become more efficient
"its pay dynamics - the minister explains - has doubled in the last 8-10 years due to the private sector and is much higher than the inflation rate".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have gathered to reject Brunett’s decree standards in line with a Codacons-backed request.
"While the Minister of Public Administration today will present figures on lower absenteeism due to illness - writes the Consumer Protection Association - the nation of 'emergency sloths' is constantly growing.
“In Italy, we have thousands of productive and correct public servants who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.”
In Taru, it will mainly protest against the exclusion of sickness benefits, which depend on activities; the extension of the period during which the sick person can be checked, at what time the control visits will be carried out, and against other norms included in the new ministerial provisions.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Resolute prevention"
Every day in Italy there will be 2,500 work-related accidents, three people will die and twenty-seven will remain permanently disabled.
The Inail values confirm that in 2007 we had about 1,200 deaths as a result of work-related injuries.
These values testify to the seriousness of the phenomenon, which remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social media and the media to this dramatic problem, Anmil is celebrating the 58th National Day of the Victims of Occupational Accidents, set for the second Sunday in October, in all Italian regions.
“The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic reports of these days confirm the importance of the issue of work safety,” President Giorgio Napolitano confirmed in a report sent to President Anmil, the National Association for the Disabled and the Disabled for Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his deep admiration for the continuous joint efforts on safety at work, on the protection of injured workers, on assistance to the families of the victims and on the participation of public opinion.
"Naturally, outraged 'enough' has been raised, honestly shared face-to-face with the tragedies that, by their extent, provoke media outbursts and the participation of public opinion, but everyday reality once again offers us dramatic cases, even repeating itself in its dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide the fact that "there is undoubtedly a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Numerous initiatives in the field of education are of particular importance in order to make young people facing the world of work more aware.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its worrying social severity, to apply and improve legislative norms.
Chamber President Gianfranco Fini, for his part, stressed that "the phenomenon of death as a result of a work accident creates an absolutely critical social state, as it offends the conscience of each of us and forces all institutions to make a convincing effort to bring this state to an end."
"As for the data on work-related injuries, they seem to show some positive turnaround, but this does not deny that the number of deaths from work-related injuries is as alarming as it is alarming," said President Anmila Pietro Mercandelli.
“We wouldn’t want this ‘reduction effort’ to lead to less attention, because it’s the moment that attention stops that tragedy erupts.
“We believe that there is still too little work being done to stop the problem of accidents in general and there are many activities that can have an impact on this problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion, to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the field of training of workers, starting from school age."
"There is still a need for further efforts - he added - in terms of communication and participation of public opinion.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards the phenomenon which constitutes an exceptional social phenomenon.”
Mercandelli eventually declared that it was a progressive degeneration of the level of compensation rights envisaged for labour victims and the "displacement of supportive care" that the system has been receiving in recent years.
“The aim is therefore to return the worker’s guarantee of insurance – he added – because the fate of those who harm themselves must not depend on the spontaneity or gift from time to time by the legislator.”
MP3 Players Accused of Being at Risk
Listening to loud music for a long time and using portable music devices as an Mp3 player can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a notice published today by the European Commission, which cites the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Health Risks that have recently emerged and been identified (Csrseri) EU in an official report distributed in Brussels.
“From this scientific opinion – we read in the notes – it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music using portable music devices for at least five years, more than an hour a week and keep the device at a high volume, risk a permanent loss of hearing.”
“It worries me that so many young people who use often portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels can unknowingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way,” admits Meglena Kuneva.
“From the scientific findings – the leader continues – there is a clear risk and there is a need to react quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to inspire consumers and make this information public.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in light of this scientific finding to make them fully effective and keep pace with new technology.”
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to investigate this problem in light of the high use of portable musical instruments and the growing number of young people exposed to the noise of this origin.
"Scientists - concluded the executive official of the EU - confirm that there is a need to worry and now the European Commission will check together with other members and like-minded parties who have raised the problem, what measures could possibly be put in place to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise, the transmission of which is the cause of noise".
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by overexposure to similar forms of noise.
It is very possible to limit these damages by looking for solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee states that users of portable music devices, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for a period of only five hours a week, will currently exceed the current limits corresponding to the maximum allowed noise at the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for a long time run the risk of permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem should concern 5-10% of users of such devices and their amount can be counted between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno will leave the Commission for the Future of the Capital
Today we will start, we will close in March, we will have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which met this morning in its new headquarters behind the Caracalla Spas.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the commission will draw up a handbook for Rome.
When the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the municipal council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglia and his councilman Gianni Alemanna.
"The Commission is completely independent and includes all political, social and cultural ideas - he wants to emphasize Alemanno - it will have to secure proposals for the development of Rome, which will eventually be used by the political arbitrators who remain on the Giunta e Municipal Council.
It is not a question of exchanging functions, but only of trying to have some place where to process a large project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and then dissolved, as these institutions must have an exact deadline.
In June, we will present a strategic plan and take advantage of the work carried out by the Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome.
To the one who accuses the Commission of being unnecessary, given that its opinion will not be binding, Alemanna will answer: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and on the quality of their proposals.
If they are of the same quality as the Attali Commission's proposals, and I am sure so in Rome, their contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics pays off on day-to-day issues and on the pressures that arise from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to emphasize that "this Commission is neither a useless undertaking nor a bluff: it is completely free, the Roman citizens will not be able to spend a single euro and will serve to think and involve the best intelligence that the capital has".
For Alemann, in essence, "it is necessary to have a strategic plan as a starting point, neither definitive nor immobile, in order to allow our city to authentically rise to the level it necessarily needs, and to think in a united spirit about its future."
The future, which, the mayor of Rome specifies "will not be limited only to the current municipal border, but will look much further" not only in terms of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as the capital, but "will also include the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Middle East".
Obama? The first anti-American president. It is already known why
One well-known American president wrote that it is important for him to remain independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.”
The first was Jimmy Carter, who by his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and maintained relations (as today as a private citizen) with the enemy of Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise just as the election date approaches.
A Miami woman wrote on her website: “This man is full of ambition.
But Obama has the audacity: he thinks he’s going to get the highest office of a nation that’s had two governors and five black senators everywhere!”
In fact, these attacks don't say much"; they are attacks of clearly racial origin and don't answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then we have polls; everyone says that Obama will win and with great advantage.
Even in this case, there are those who act according to the heart and not according to the brain.
One newspaper from Mississippi, from the southern tip of the United States, wrote a comment: at least once in the election booth we know well who the American patriot will vote for.
One side of the American mentality will emerge, which has remained dormant until the very last moment.
Tell us what you want, and we'll take care of it ourselves, who we can select, whether it's Obama or McCain."
There are people who swear that if Obama were to win, we would leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, it seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
But despite all these considerations for Democrats, the main weapon is George Bush.
1,500 people asked: what mistakes did Bush make during his tenure? Eighty-nine percent answered: Iraq.
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost fifty thousand soldiers and sent him home with a spear in his ass.
In Iraq, 4,500 soldiers were killed and the Americans were not forced to pack up.
And yet Iraq has become a weakness for most of Bush.
Who will take the place of Georgie W will have to perform a huge task.
The economic collapse of the USA was also felt by journalists: in the newspapers there is a period of investigation. And many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the press.
The PEW Research Center asked five hundred journalists about the state of their profession and the assumption of the future.
Today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the respondents did not say openly that they had fewer concerns about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is a crisis of the destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where editors work to put together newspapers, are a huge problem.
According to the journalists interviewed, this is a problem that needs to be solved if we do not want traditional journalism to fundamentally change as it is understood by the general public.
There is a clear but complex pessimism in the American press.
Six out of ten press journalists and executive seniors are convinced that journalism on a national scale is going the wrong way.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the website is going.
A larger publishing house is paving the way for the Internet, which many see as a "killer" of print.
The “economic pressure” that journalists are warning about has increased by up to 79%.
Five hundred journalists interviewed admitted that they resorted to technology in the hope that they would "do something good" for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run newsrooms—that is, executives—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of leaders at the national level are sure that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value drops to 23%.
This has something to do with "work safety" for someone.
Leaders who think they will lose their jobs in three years are at the national level 47%.
As far as journalists are concerned, they are up to 30%.
When it comes to “certain work” concerning staff (our editors, ed.) in America, it’s still on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists are working on a contract.
In a nation as vast as the U.S.A., with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want, and so it’s a matter of taking or leaving.
Managers almost always receive huge salaries and the editor can earn as much as ten thousand dollars a month without paying a pension and insurance.
As for the holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year until reaching fifteen days after a certain number of years.
However, American journalists, according to their own admission, often get sick within a year.
It's just a climate issue.
UNIPOL: COURT IN ROME, DANILO COPPOLA CONSTITUTES IN GROTTAFERRAT
Carmelo Rinaudo, the president of the Second Criminal Chamber of the Roman Court, decided to reject the application of the real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppoly, who asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with a counteroffer in the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During the trial, at his own expense, he was released from his home prison last week, which was transformed into a forced permanent stay in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni e Gaetano Pecorella, asked that a real estate entrepreneur could change his place of residence from a rural town to a capital.
However, according to the court, this move (against which he expressed himself pm) would allow him to influence his company and get to the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
The move came days before the House of Representatives voted against a $700 billion bailout plan put forward by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is also confirmed by yesterday’s New York Times, which informs us that the current crisis divides the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, more moderate, in favor of federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, which is, on the contrary, conservative and hostile in the South.
The soul that arrogantly manifested itself in the vote that I spoke of at the beginning.
But this thing just quoted is just an example of the changes, the big changes that the current economic earthquake is already showing: not only in the United States, but throughout the West, and perhaps not only here.
Both in the US and in Europe, this crisis seems to be an accelerator of phenomena that have been in incubation for a long time, which are being exacerbated in the new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary revival of the market, the dual category of state-power in relation to a certain re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of the banking financial institutions, which, of course, have strong ties abroad, but which are mainly involved in the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
At the same time, this has created a political problem for those who run it: it means how to respond to the difficulties and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears world economic, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationality seems to be essentially out of the game or that it has nothing to add: the obvious evidence has been given by the European Union, which, as always, is divided between different interests and different national strategies, and which cannot decide on a single political line.
And so everyone expects the intervention of the government of each individual state, rescue plans, the revival of the market, new rules and, above all, the division of funds: the moment we get into the emergency, only the states have the economic means, the amount of financial resources, so that they are able to try to put everything in order.
It also possesses the necessary means and powers to use them: two sources of immense value, under certain circumstances, by which perhaps no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose of them to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the national-state element is, after all, in full accord with the growing importance that attempts to attribute recent economic progress to one factor closely associated with it: territorial jurisdiction.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the kingdom of the web, increasingly sophisticated technologies, immaterial, while we were convinced that the world's finances were already destined to rule the world, we realized from nothing that our future would not have to be more like the present.
All the things that would be said can be transported from one place on earth to another, but in any case they are connected, absolutely, to a limited space, territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler certainly has far more cards in his hand than who is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a place without grain, without oil, and without water.
I'm getting to the second novice, who's anticipating a breakup.
Who speaks of territory, of state, of government, inevitably speaks of politics, that is, of leadership.
Given the economic crisis, it seems that two convergent phenomena are being created.
On the one hand, an awareness that there is an objective need for authoritative leadership, a request for someone to be able to grasp the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit towards the existing leadership, especially the economic one, which proved equally unsatisfactory and full of dark places.
And together something even deeper and, in a sense, disturbing: discredit, impatience, a sense of incompetence and absence that seeks to dominate the entire ruling class in an ever-increasing number of Western countries.
In fact, it seems that it is spreading more and more in the broad masses of the population than if their actions were the same as the ideas of the hitherto popular elite, as their way of feeling and being, as their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already passed its time and is indifferent to the views of the majority.
The demand for leadership simply feeds one branch of the Bush underground, but the strong movement against the removal of the ruling classes and the traditional political order manifests itself in sudden electoral "rebellions" or in unexpected changes of collective moods in the last and last days, from the rise of the Conservatives to the rise of the Conservatives.
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligence, someone would say through their format, have more and more problems to understand, that is, to represent, which, not from today, is created in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis has broken down again.
Before that, it would be too much to talk about a permanent "mass rebellion".
But we certainly can't say that it means to have properly open eyes.
Super glue to walk on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
This is the object of various American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists have managed to keep a hundred-kilogram body glued to the vertical wall using a sticker of only 2.5 centimeters square.
STUDY – The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers at the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is the development of materials that already exist that use a special carbon structure called carbon dwarf tubes.
“The foundation of the glue can be imagined as a series of tubes laid out as an ordered pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of a gecko, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to ensure perfect adhesion.
Tests carried out on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, showed that the new glue is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time, "it simply sticks away from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be useful as a temporary glue," adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on walls like Spiderman? Perhaps so, but researchers are thinking of far less fascinating use as a combination of electrical appliances, because dwarf carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electrical energy.
Other applications could relate to aeronautical space engineering.
So far, no super heroes.
FURTHER RESEARCH – The University of Berkley, California, is also dedicated to researching new adhesives.
In an article in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists presented a glue formed from microfibers as hair that cleans itself from dust by moving across the surface to still maintain perfect fit.
Medications: never with juices
Pay attention to grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer, because they are refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving drugs, their ingestion changes the increase or decrease in effectiveness with serious health consequences.
For David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, to highlight the risks of both ready-made and fresh-made juices in combination with the ingestion of certain drugs, at the 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, a new alarm is raised: one glass of grapefruit and a glass of grapefruit are enough.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to toxic levels the effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological drugs.
MEDICINES AT RISK- The Italian Medical Agency itself announced this in a newsletter two years ago and urged doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers arising from this mixture and to pay attention to what they drink if they take medicines, such as Diazepam or Metado.
NOT ONLY GRAPEFRUIT – According to experts, orange and apple juice also contain substances that suppress drugs.
A long list of effects subdued by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the challenge of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "Such appearances are usually immediately reported to a variety of international and national pharmacy agencies, which may arrange and exchange drug information instructions.
So always read the illustrative drug notes you get and if you come across anything unclear, don’t worry, but ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification,” Ansa said.
Nobel Prize in Economics Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his study of commercial models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman is a 55-year-old New Yorker who teaches at Priceton University and is a well-known editor of the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration’s foreign, economic, and political moves.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron collapsed, Krugman predicted in a commentary published in the New York Times that the second event would be, in terms of the consequences on the history of the United States, much more important than the first.
The prediction, which caused quite a bit of controversy and which was criticized for years, but which turned out to be accurate.
“I am surprised and shocked at how quickly the collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared out of the public interest,” Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenz Biniho Smaghi of the Executive Committee of the Central European Bank, Krugman is "an economist of great importance", but also a popularizer who has "a very aggressive style, especially critical of the excesses of the Bush liberalist administration".
Open Office, we have here the third release of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It’s the release day of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source personalization package that aims to penetrate more and more users, from home to office, from experts to public administration, as a free alternative to the more familiar Microsoft Office.
After about a year of volunteer work, controlled by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with various new features: to the welcome screen and to the revised and improved opening window of the Document are added more, much more substantial, as compatibility for the operating system Apple Mac OS X and support of the new format of the ISO2.
Emphasis is also placed on cooperation with the Office 2007 package, Open Office is able to open the document with a new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting are the special features of some models such as what allows you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example for transmission by electronic means, or the ability to transfer a PDF file to a model of graphic design and preserve the original appearance of the page.
Still from this point of view, we can create documents "PDF hybrids", which are similar to typical Adobe graphics format and have the properties of a table processor or a text program.
Collaboration is an element that has gained many improvements within application programs: in excel it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program, each collaborator is assigned one color to the comments to make the identification clearer in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on moving some of the Open Office features to the Web (on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should reschedule the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, has been added to the English version, which has been on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent home or to the workplace upon request.
And if the topic of gratuity can be a trigger for expansion in households, it is on the business area of the Open Office package a lot of bets, and can already count on a variety of projects implemented in public administration and in schools.
And there is no shortage of training, consulting and support services ideal for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing replacing Word; Calc is a spreadsheet processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, is a program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, after all, is a graphical model.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and if we consider that to date we are at almost 3 million and 600,000, with the release of a new version it is possible that this expected number can also be exceeded.
Kohl's results are also positive, it's the fourth case of doping
A new positive case on the last Tour de France: it is the Raku<0xC5><0xA1>an Bernhard Kohl, from the Gerolsteiner team, the third classified and winner of the T-shirt of the best climber.
The report was quoted by the newspaper L'Equipe.
26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive racer on Cera, the third-generation Epo, after Italians Riccard Ricci<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepol and German Stefan Schumacher, and he from Gerolsteiner.
Kohl's blood test results are among those performed in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the control analysis confirms Cera's positivity, Raku<0xC5><0xA1>an will lose third place on the Tour and face two years of disqualification.
The report on Kohl’s positivity to the third generation EPO is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had already informed the Austrian government about the result.
26-year-old Raku<0xC5><0xA1>an placed on the podium behind Spaniard Carlos Sastre and American Cadel Evansem, also won a pointed top t-shirt.
IMIGRANTS:NEW YORK TIMES ALSO, IS ITALY Racist?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has only in the last house turned into the preferred destination of immigrants" accepted with resistance.
This is how one long article in the New York Times, which devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, asks about the case of young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan because of a robbery.
This case highlights what the New York Times defines as the "paradox of the north": the northern regions are at the same time the ones where "more integration and more work" is registered, but also "the strongest anti-immigrant thinking in the country and the strongest support of the Northern League".
To confirm the rising tension between Italy and immigrants, the NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturna.
Not only that.
Also, the new legislation demanded by Lego, which seeks to curb immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants, is cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
The tendency emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedict XVI in Quirinale, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of expensive rents - up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for university students does not know the crisis.
According to the latest research of Sunia, the departments for renters, rent a single room can cost a student in Milan up to 900 euros, in Florence 700, in Naples 650, in Rome 600.
"Jev has already reached such a size that entire layers of students have lost the right to study due to the overall too high prices that their families would have to bear - explains the head of the office for the studies of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in this city, a large demand for students has been so deformed, the process has been so deformed,
In most cases, the rental offer contains several offences: contracts in a free way, unregistered, without a limited rental, and related sub-rents.
For Sunji, there is a need for exceptional intervention that could regulate prices through a tax audit.
If we look at the details of the research, we will see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, it is necessary for one bed about 450 euros, for a single room is paid from a minimum price 650 (the Bande Nere zone) through an average value of 800 (the Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera zone) up to a maximum of 900 (the Vitoria zone).
In Florence, one bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, one room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in zones close to the university, 250/280 euros are needed per bed in a double room, from 370 to 500 in a single room.
In Rome in the central university zones (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) want about 600 euros for a single room, 450 beds in a double.
The values are slightly lower (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>550 per single) in zones close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
We will save only if we move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room zones Prenestina, Centocelle and the like.
In Naples, 300/450 euros are needed for a bed, 400 to 600 euros for a room, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari they want 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 euros for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of citizens.
In cities such as Perugia, where it is the most common phenomenon rented to students from countries outside the European Union, another anomaly is finally noted: an increase of about 25-30% in the fee they want for foreign students, compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historic halls
Cinematographic historical halls close in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without cinema is like a blind man, like a face without eyes."
The image offered by director Giuseppe Tornator successfully documents what is happening in large Italian city centers, but also in rural towns.
The process of restricting cinemas, the birth of large multi-halls in the suburbs and the subsequent disappearance of monohalls in the central zones of cities, is one of the events that seem to be inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the signs of a real cultural crime.
“It’s as if we lost a friend, a friend, a friend with whom we shared a piece of the journey and a lot of emotions,” says the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film that won the Tornator an Oscar and a grand jury prize in Cannes twenty years ago.
The values obtained by Anec, the main association of operators, speak clearly: in the last five years, the doors of 316 cinemas of the traditional type have been closed, and the highest bill has been paid primarily by halls in the most important cities: 10 min in Florence, 9 in Naples, 6 in Milan, and 9 in Naples.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with the loss of 82 cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And the proof that the first responsible for their disappearance is the emergence of multiplexes, it is these three Italian regions that have registered the highest number of new cinemas: 195 more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian process has developed irrationally,” says Paolo Protti, president of Anec,”it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that those already existing will survive, because when one cinema in the city closes, not all of its visitors are willing to move to multiplex.
Then let’s not even talk about an insufficient subsidy to the fund for the benefit of the operators: the previous state debt is about 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it is a shame that the government does not respect existing laws.
It would require between <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16 million and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>18 million a year to support the sector.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city to be concerned about closures and which decided to find a way out by signing a protocol between the municipalities and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in the historic centers and in the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are steps of tax relief in favor of operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to fly to the zone with limited traffic and will have special prices to stop and in some parking lots.
“I like this initiative,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna’s example by introducing other measures.”
However, it is certain that in order to be able to stand against the great power of multiplex, traditional halls must improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: the closure of the Super Cinema in Bagheria, instead of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to establish the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I have been thinking about for 10 years.
I’ve been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk past the already closed Rialto or Quirinale in Nazionale Street, where I’ve shared so much emotion that I don’t have to look at the dusty inscriptions, I turn to the other side.”
The link between politics and the mafia group 'ndrangheta, Mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioie Tauro was willing to adjust the municipal elections according to the interests of the Piromalli mafia group."
The charges brought by the Anti-Mafia Directorate in Calabria against Mayor and Deputy Mayor Gioia Tauro Giorgi Dal Torrione e Rosario Schiavone, and Mayor Rosarna Carl Martelli, imprisoned this morning for external cooperation with the Mafia organization, are heavy.
Gioacchino Piromalli, an old intermediary between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, a lawyer, the namesake of the boss, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia nature, sentenced to pay 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," prosecutors wrote, as two local administrations expressed willingness to pay for consultations with lawyer Piromalli.
“This would allow the mafia group to officially enter the city authorities and facilitate already huge possibilities of control and management of public administration,” the judges wrote.
The president of the California Regional Commission Agazio Loiero does not hide that "secret agreements between local institutions and organized criminal underworld there is a lot in his region: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others, where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the pressures of 'ndrangheta, heroes who are still untainted."
The arrests this morning follow the arrests in July last year, by which police showed that the Piromalli mafia group had received a final intervention.
Since the end of April last year - the city council of Gioia Tauro has been dissolved since 1991, the reason was the supposed connection between organized crime and local government - local politicians were stripped of their functions in the municipal administration.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, president of the Christian Democrats, who at the time of the dissolution was elected head of the right-wing coalition after a narrow election in May.
He was screaming about the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called for the responsibility of then-Deputy Interior Minister Marc Minniti and accused him of conceiving everything for political reasons, but the judges in the imprisonment order signed this morning explain that the mafia group has even gone so far as to request a change of project A.
Other hearings ordered against Dal Torrion, the public prosecutor writes, revealed "the willingness to move the claims of an entrepreneur, the representatives of some larger group very close, as is generally known, to Piromalli and to adapt the choices of public administration to the interests of the mafia group."
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones come into play.
It’s an endless bearing that covers more than 70% of the Earth’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides, outflows are the new sources of inexhaustible energy on which the sight of colossuses like Chevron, who is now trying to reach out to these sources.
The ability to generate energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for more than a hundred years, and in the 1970s, in the context of the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil fell around 1980, the idea of using marine energy went awry. But now environmental organizations and a new increase in oil prices gave the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 stated that about 15 percent of the world’s electricity consumption could be covered by the use of ocean wave motion.
This amount would be twice the amount of energy currently produced in nuclear power plants.
In addition, there are currents and tides and outflows.
Giants are attacking.
The company that invested in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 agreed to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When this plan was announced, it looked like a huge revolutionary step.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technology,” a spokesman for a company linked to the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and they’re thinking about working with us.”
The cooperation that we are considering is about obtaining permission from the U.S. Energy Commission, which is necessary for the launch of the project on the use of marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot underestimate this signal, especially when we consider that it is precisely in Alaska that the US continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush came up with a plan for a new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are tracking the trace of marine energy, and the amounts invested so far, although not known in detail, are showing increasing interest, according to observers.
Technology that needs to be developed.
Experts talk about the technology, which is still in its infancy, because it is not known what impact the use of marine energy will have on the environment.
For now, facilities in Portugal and some in Scotland are small in size and do not appear to cause major ecosystem problems.
However, for greater energy production, it is necessary to use technologies with a greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of fights that are interconnected.
The force of the waves, which moves with the buoys up and down, is changed with the help of rollers and cylinders to the hydraulic pressure inside these buoys.
The pressure rotates the turbine, which supplies energy to the generator.
The energy is fed to the shore by submarine cables.
So far, there are four devices of this type in the project phase, which are waiting only for federal approval, and some of the energy could serve military purposes.
On the contrary, Verdant Power is already producing energy for the shopping mall and parking lot using six subsea turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of water during the inflow and outflow causes the rotation of turbines, which is fed by this rotating movement of the generator.
Verdant stated that they have a long list of clients who are waiting for the necessary authorizations due to the possibility of using this energy.
After the waves, after the tide and after the tide.
A particular interest at this point deserves the potential of tides and outflows, they say at the Institute for Electrical Energy Research.
Although it is an unrelated factor, the inflow and outflow are more predictable than wind, sun or waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is in the energy inflow and outflow states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as with other coastal states, that they have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008, and predicted investments of up to 35 million dollars for 2009.
