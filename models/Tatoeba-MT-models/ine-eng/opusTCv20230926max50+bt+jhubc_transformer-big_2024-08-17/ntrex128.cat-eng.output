Members of the Welsh Assembly concerned about "identifying them as Muppets"
Several members of the assembly have expressed their dismay at the proposal to amend their title by MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This controversy has arisen at the root of the plan to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
The members of the assembly of all the different political parties have shown their concern that this measure may become a laughing stock.
A member of the Labour party's assembly said his party was concerned that MWP would "stay with Twp or Pwp".
For readers who are not Welsh: In Welsh, twp means stupid and, pwp, excrement.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party assembly has commented that the whole of his party "does not see it with good eyes" and has proposed several alternatives.
For his part, a conservative Welsh member has claimed that his group was "open" in the face of the name change, but also commented that there is too little difference between the term "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, it must be said that the letter "w" in Welsh is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in English from Yorkshire.
According to the committee of the assembly in charge of drawing up the legal draft to introduce the name changes: "The final decision on any qualification to appoint the members of the assembly will of course rest with the members themselves".
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gives the Welsh Assembly all the power to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, with broad support for the proposal to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
As for the title of the members of the assembly, although the committee voted for "Wales Members of Parliament" or "WPM", the "MWP" option is the one that received wider support in the public consultation.
Apparently, the members of the assembly are suggesting different alternatives. However, the attempt to reach a consensus can be quite a curse for the Speaker of the assembly, Elin Jones, who is expected to present the legal draft on the changes in a matter of weeks.
The legislation on reforms will include other changes related to the functioning of the assembly, such as rules on disqualification of its members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the assembly will hold the final vote on their denomination during the debate related to the legislation.
The Macedonians will vote in a referendum to change the name of their country
Citizens will choose Sunday whether or not to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular consultation was decided in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, which already has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor represents a way to reclaim its territory and has repeatedly opposed the country's attempts to become part of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change plebiscite, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, those in favor, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that the name change is simply the price one has to pay to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's stop ringing: the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the old people I’ve spoken to say there was a bar and a church in every corner,” Adams said.
“Nowadays, there’s none of them left.”
According to Adams, the disappearance of the bars can be understood.
“People have a different way of socializing today,” he says.
“The bars have already ceased to be the kind of living rooms for the neighborhood where people used to go periodically.”
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of assets will not last as long as their leaders anticipate "and that sooner or later they will return to where they came from".
The churches, he adds, could end up being replaced by apartment buildings and condominiums with the kind of people who won't be of any help to the temples that remain in the neighborhood.
“The vast majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he says, “and therefore what they will do is accelerate the closure of all churches, since it is quite unlikely that the majority of people who move into these condominiums will end up being members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis; the Metropolitan Community church in 1870 and St. Martin's ten years later.
The white Methodist congregation that was originally there left during the 1930s.
A black congregation that was nearby acquired the property of the building.
St. Martin's passed into the hands of a black congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street retailers, one of Harlem's main shopping streets, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire caused serious damage to the building, and when Reverend Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild it, it was then that they commissioned the carillon.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Church, proudly described the carillon as "the bells of the poor people".
The expert who sounded the bell in July described it differently: "A cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first rollercoaster in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had to move to the largest rollercoaster in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
According to Mr. Merriweather, St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has sounded like St. Martin's in recent months, on the contrary, have been the complicated stories of architects and contractors, some of them brought by the lay leaders of the church and others by the episcopal diocese.
The council, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese last July expressing their concern that the diocese "intended to pass on the costs" to the council, although the latter was not involved in the hiring of the architects and contractors that the diocese sent.
Some parishioners have complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy was injured while hunting for lobsters in California.
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while making a dive to hunt for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
According to Chad Hammel on KSWB-TV in San Diego, he spent half an hour diving with friends on Saturday morning when he heard the cries of a boy asking for help. Then they rowed with a group to the place where the boy was to help him get out of the water.
Hammel says that at first it was thought that it was the joy of having caught a lobster, but then he "realized that he was calling out 'I've been bitten!
They have mocked me!'
He had his entire collarbone cracked," Hammel observed as he reached the boy.
“Because everyone came out of the water, I shouted, ‘There’s a shark in the water!’”
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in a serious condition.
It is not known what type of shark is responsible for the attack.
In a press conference, rescuer Larry Giles commented that he had been working for a few weeks that a shark had been detected in the area, but that it was decided that the species was not dangerous.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries in the upper torso area.
Authorities closed for 48 hours access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of shark in the area, but that most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans for the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's has decided to compete in Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with beauty product aisles in the style of large warehouses occupied with specialized employees.
These large aisles are only part of a considerable investment in the beauty market in the UK, a market that moves around <0xC2><0xA3>2800 million and continues to grow while the fashion and home products sectors are lagging behind, and will be tested in 11 stores across the country to be further tested.
The investment in beauty products is the product of the greed of supermarkets to take advantage of the space on their shelves that was previously intended for televisions, microwaves and household products.
Sainsbury’s says it will double its beauty offering to offer up to 3,000 different products, including for the first time brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with areas of similar brands to those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket company is also in the process of relaunching its range of Boutique makeup products so that most of the products are now suitable for vegans, an aspect increasingly demanded by younger consumers.
The Fragrance Shop retail chain will also open concessions to two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened last week in Croydon, south London, while the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and switching to a habit of buying food in smaller quantities every day in small supermarkets has made large supermarkets have to find other ways to convince people to come.
According to Mike Coupe, executive director of Sainsbury's, the stores will increasingly resemble department stores in an attempt by the supermarket chain to fight the discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been introducing Argos outlets to many of its supermarkets, in addition to a number of Habitat stores since it acquired both chains two years ago, which, he says, has served to relaunch the sales of cheeses and increase the profitability of acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to relaunch its beauty and pharmacy product departments resulted in a failure.
Sainsbury's ran a joint operation test with Boots in the early 2000s, but it all ended abruptly by not agreeing on how to split the profits of the chain of pharmacies into supermarkets.
This new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its business of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of the LloydsPharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to Sainsbury's, Lloyds will play an important role in the global plan, as it will expand the range of luxury skincare brands, such as La Roche-Posay or Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director of Sainsbury’s, comments: “We have transformed the look of our beauty product aisles to improve the environment for our customers.
We have invested in specifically trained workers who will be of great help in offering advice.
Our range of brands is designed to fit any need; on the other hand, the attractive environment and practical location make us now one of the preferred destinations for beauty products and we challenge the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby backtracks on <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Dragons' Den star Den Peter Jones left "angry" after television host Holly Willoughby made a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with Jones' lifestyle brand business to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time to devote to the Truly home products and accessories joint business.
The business of these two media characters had come to be compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning anchor used Instagram to announce her departure.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones infuriated by retiring at the last minute from the lucrative lifestyle brand joint business to focus on his own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV, which will also report big profits.
According to several sources, Jones was "angry" when the red TV star admitted, during a tense meeting held on Tuesday at her empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that the presenter's new arrangements, worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, implied that she would no longer have enough time to devote to the joint product brand.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and aspired to double Willoughby's fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones took a private plane to one of his holiday homes outside the UK.
According to one source, "Truly was by far Holly's top priority.
It was destined to be her long-term future and where we would see her for the next twenty or thirty years.
His decision to step back left all parties involved speechless.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, we were so close to launch...
Right now there’s a warehouse full of goods at Marlow headquarters ready to be sold.”
According to experts, the departure of the presenter of This Morning, one of the most profitable stars in the United Kingdom, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment that had been made in products, from pillows and candles to clothing and clothing for the home, and the possibility of delays for its lac.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin had maintained an intimate relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined him as president last March.
Both couples spend the holidays together. In addition, Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will be the next M&S brand ambassador and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s I’m A Celebrity program.
A source close to Jones said: “We will not comment on your business.”
Hard accusations... "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the possible criticism he received from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unlike a president" and for having such a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did Trump give up so much?
Trump said, mocking the tone of a newscaster’s voice:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in holding a second meeting after the first one held in Singapore in June was declared as a major step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations towards denuclearization are stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, senior North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told United Nations General Assembly leaders on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “corresponding response” from the US to its country’s first disarmament initiatives.
However, he noted, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions with the aim of maintaining pressure.
Trump’s point of view, on the other hand, was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We’re doing very well with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to declare war on North Korea.
Millions of people would have lost their lives.
And now we have this great relationship.”
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have had positive results: end of missile tests, help to free hostages and return home from the remains of American soldiers.
And he defended his unusual approach by talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this crowded precinct, we’d have about 200,” Trump said, noting the crowd in front of him.
An island destroyed and hundreds dead as a result of a tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organizations in other countries were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok's population had to be displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not ask for international assistance, so the situation is quite demanding," says Ms. Sumbung.
While Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not certain even that foreign people can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, commented that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see whether or not international agencies are allowed to contribute when offering aid.
Given the constant earthquakes that Indonesia is suffering, the country is unfortunately still unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters have been built in Aceh in the event of a tsunami, they are not common on other coasts.
The apparent lack of warning sirens in Palu in the event of a tsunami, although there was a warning in place, is likely to have contributed to the death toll.
Moving between the huge number of islands in Indonesia is, at best, a challenge.
And natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok to attend to the victims of the earthquake is now heading for Palu; however, it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo had as a central element of his election campaign the improvement of Indonesia's badly damaged infrastructure, and has invested huge amounts of money in roads and railways.
However, Joko's government faces a year-long re-election fraught with funding shortfalls.
Joko also faces pressure from the country's permanent sectarian tensions, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative caire faith.
More than 1,000 dead and tens of thousands displaced are the result of street fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, bows and arrows, and other bloodthirsty weapons.
Note: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes the goal of the tie with a distant shot in front of Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with his goal scored in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal as his team lost 1-0.
He settled the ball to the left before letting go an incredible shot aimed at the second goal.
The shot traversed the entire area with a large elevation as it propelled itself towards the right-hand cross of the gate.
The ball finally started the descent over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga to try to stop it and ended up in the bottom of the net.
“I was just trying to get to that position to be able to shoot, and players like Shaqiri always play it forward as much as possible, so I tried to create as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kanté coming, I made a touch and I didn’t think much about it, I just dedicated myself to juggling.”
Chelsea won 1-0 at rest after scoring a goal in the 25th minute through their Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In the play, the Blue team's lead came back from heel a pass to Mateo Kovacic before starting from almost midfield and sprinting towards Liverpool's field.
Kovacic made a quick combination from midfield.
He then made a magnificent in-depth pass, which left Hazard inside the area with the ball under control.
Hazard overcame the defense to finish in the second goal with a left leg hit where Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker could not reach.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage next Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from Indonesia’s tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to data from the country's disaster agency reported on Sunday morning.
Many people were trapped among the rubble of collapsed buildings due to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and which caused waves of up to 6 meters, according to agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho in a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was completely covered by the rubble of the destroyed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding a woman stabbed
The murder investigation began after the woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with several stab wounds on Grayson Mews, John Street; then a 32-year-old man was arrested as a murder suspect.
Police have asked residents in the area to have seen or heard anything related to the crime to present themselves before the authorities.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "While the investigation is still at a preliminary stage, I would like to make a call to anyone who is near John Street in Birkenhead and has seen or heard anything suspicious, please contact us.
I would also like to make a call to anyone, especially taxi drivers who have been able to capture anything through the car’s onboard camera, to get in touch, as they could have vital information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body they found is from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman have arrived at the crime scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
As investigations continue, police have said they are reporting the events to relatives closest to the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but police have told him that no one has been allowed in or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are being warned that they will spend hours before they can re-enter.
It could be felt as a police officer explained to a man that the entire area is treated as the scene of the crime.
A woman appeared at the scene crying.
He kept saying, “It’s terrible!”
At 14:00, two police vans were inside the cordoned-off area with another van parked outside.
A number of agents remained inside the cordoned-off area controlling the block of floors.
Anyone who may have information is asked to send a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 and mentioning September 30 issue 247.
Cromwell's statue of the British parliament becomes the last monument affected by the discussion around "rewriting history"
His disappearance would be a kind of poetic justice for the purest Taliban-style destruction of so many cultural and religious objects in England perpetrated by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society has described Crick's proposal as a "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, comments: “In the current debate around the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s figure in front of the Palace of Westminster would become one of the main targets.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps he would end up sacrificing the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor that he did during the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is proof of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worthy of commemoration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than he is now, as a defender of parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case obviously from the monarchy.
Whether or not this fact constitutes a fully accurate representation remains a matter of historical debate.
What is true is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisable figure who represents a side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of being celebrated and commemorated.
A Chinese farmer is killed by a pig.
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, local sources say.
The man, identified only by his last name "Yuan", was found dead with a slicing artery and all covered in blood near a pig yard in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer was preparing to inject vaccines into pigs in a court in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
As far as I know, he had travelled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered an open door leading to an adjoining pig yard.
According to him, there was a large male pig in the yard with blood in its mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the 250-kg prawn had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin had his legs torn and full of blood,” said the cousin, surnamed “Wu,” according to the Guiyang Evening News.
The scenes recorded by the security camera show Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither owned by Yuan nor his cousin.
One of the market officials commented on the evening news that the pig remained closed and isolated in order to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police gathered the evidence at the crime scene.
According to reports, Yuan's family and market officials are negotiating compensation for his death.
Despite being very rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have previously been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 300-kg pig grabbed a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife was able to scare the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC news that pigs are not normally aggressive but that the taste of blood can act as a "trigger."
“They like to play.
They are like children, they are very curious... they do not go with the idea of doing harm.
You just have to give them the respect they deserve,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will carry torrential rains across the southwest of the United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it advances over the coldest waters on the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the Rose will carry torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the next few days.
The Rosa had winds of 138 km/h, typical of a Category 1 hurricane, at 5:00 a.m. on Sunday, eastern U.S. time, and was located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The Rose is expected to move northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean, which is moving east toward the west coast of the United States. When the Rose approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to leave a strong tropical humidity in the south-west direction of the U.S. cape.
The Rosa will leave up to 250 mm of rain on Monday in some parts of Mexico.
Tropical moisture will then interact with the approaching depression to generate widespread torrential rains throughout the southwest over the next few days.
At various points, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous floods, waste streams and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates close to 50 to 75 mm per hour at various points, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall is expected from 50 to 100 mm in parts of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
There is a possibility that floods form, since the situation is getting worse very quickly due to the scattered nature of the tropical rains.
It is strongly discouraged to enter the desert on foot in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
The torrential rains could cause the gorges to become uncontrolled rivers. In addition, storms can bring wind gusts and dust clouds to specific points.
The approaching depression will bring torrential rains to certain points on the southern California coast.
It is possible that total precipitation above 50 mm is recorded, which could cause minor waste flows and slippery roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Isolated rain checkers will begin arriving in Arizona between Sunday night and Monday morning, before the rain becomes more widespread between Monday and Tuesday night.
The torrential rains will spread to the Four Corners region on Tuesday and will persist throughout Wednesday.
In October there will be several major temperature swings across the U.S. as the Arctic cools, although the tropics will remain quite warm.
This phenomenon can sometimes cause drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
The central U.S. region on Sunday is a clear example of dramatic temperature differences.
Temperature differences of nearly 20 degrees have been recorded between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the persistent summer heat will try to expand again.
The month of October is expected to begin with heat in much of the central and eastern U.S., with temperatures around 27 degrees from the Southern Plains area to parts of the northeast.
New York City could reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
According to the long-term weather forecast, there are many chances that temperatures will be above average in the eastern U.S. during the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers saw Brett Kavanaugh’s statement
More than 20 million viewers saw on Thursday the exciting testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford. The testimony was relayed to six different television channels.
Meanwhile, political clout continued, with broadcasters interrupting regular Friday programming due to a turn of events at the last minute: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation of the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was absolutely convinced that Kavanaugh had touched her drunk and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an exalted testimony, claimed that he was absolutely convinced that this never happened.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million viewers are likely to have seen this testimony on Friday.
The company had an average audience of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
Audience figures were not immediately available for other channels that relayed the testimony, such as PBS, C-SPAN or Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble calculating the people who see it from her office.
Put into perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football playoff game or that of the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have clearly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was the network with the most audience, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's testimony, according to Nielsen.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS reached 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen data.
The interest remains high after the testimony.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement saying they would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, Flake was captured by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning while being scolded by protesters when he was trying to climb a lift to go to a court hearing.
Flake remained for several minutes with his eyes down while he was on live television on CNN.
"Here I am, in front of you," said one woman.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
They said, ‘You have power, while there are so many women who don’t have it!’
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, said he would have more to say in view of the committee.
After a few hours, all the cable and broadcast chains were already broadcasting live the moment when the Judicial Affairs Committee had to vote whether or not to proceed with Kavanaugh's appointment to the Senate floor to be put to a vote.
Flake said instead that he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee ahead of next week, a condition demanded by the minority Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by the conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
The option chosen by Flake had influence, as it was evident that Republicans would not have enough votes to support Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of “playing politics” in relation to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused those who criticized her plans to leave the European Union of "playing politics" with the future of the United Kingdom and of disparaging the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party congress in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview with May on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister May Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on the so-called Chequers Brexit plan, which states that the proposal that the UK and the EU mutually collect taxes is "absurd at all".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the death of the player of the LSU team
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of 20-year-old basketball player Wayde Sims, who was a member of the LSU team.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and sent to prison on second-degree murder charges, according to the Baton Rouge police department.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. According to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA in them, CBS affiliate WAFB reports.
After questioning Simpson, he admitted to having killed Wayde by a gunshot, according to police.
His bail has been set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The East Baton Rouge district coroner's office released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head toward the neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police's fugitive task force, the state police's forensics lab, Southern University police, and local citizens for helping with the investigation that has culminated in this arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva expressed his gratitude to the law enforcement forces in the area for their "diligence and for seeking justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
Average 1.98 m, he played a winger and grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also a basketball player on the LSU team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds to start last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade commented that the team is "destroyed" and that Wayde's death was "a very strong blow".
“Things like this are what make you suffer all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano spits ash in Mexico City
The ash blasted by the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico’s capital.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity was detected in the crater and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.

Geophysicists have detected an increase in the activity of the volcano located 72 km southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists shortly before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona last Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands of people joined counter-protests to commemorate the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote to secede.
A group of independentist individuals held by the anti-bullying police began to throw them eggs and paint powder, which led to the appearance of dark clouds of dust in the streets normally invaded by tourists.
Later that day, riots broke out with the police, who used their stands to contain the violent protesters.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted "Don't forget, don't forgive" face-to-face with unionist protesters chanting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people had to be treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local sources.
Tensions have not subsided in this region of independence mentality a year after October 1 was held a referendum considered illegal by Madrid but also carried out by the Catalan separatists.
Voters chose independence by an overwhelming majority, although the turnout was low, as opponents of secession boycotted the vote for the most part.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote by entering polling stations across the region, which led to violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups camped all night on Friday to avoid a demonstration of support for the national police.
The protest also took place, but the protesters were forced to take another route.
Narc<0xC3><0xAD>s Termes, a 68-year-old electrician and one of the participants in the independence rally along with his wife, said he no longer had much hope about the possibilities for Catalonia to achieve independence.
“Last year was one of the best times.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital victory, albeit by little margin, in the subsequent autonomous elections last December, the Catalan independence parties have suffered to maintain the momentum this year, since many of their main leaders are in self-imposed exile or detained pending the organ's retrial.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, records the police support demonstration with his phone, and claims that the conflict has been fueled by politicians from both sides.
“The tension is only increasing,” he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders jailed before the trial since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Introducing yourself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the decline in democratic values and the repression that we have seen on the part of the Spanish government,” he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after wrapping a house with a car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after a car repeatedly rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 7:30 p.m.
Inspector Bob Blemmings says damage was done to the doors and the building itself.
It is also possible that at some point someone shot a crossbow at the car.
A Menga move gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal with Livingston was a win.
Livingston, who had risen to the top this year, surprised the Glasgow Rangers in what is just Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox neighborhood club.
Dolly Menga's move made the difference, as, with this victory, Gary Holt's team moved up to second position, which they share with the Hibernian.
The Gerrards, on the other hand, continue without winning away from home in the Premiership this season. Next Sunday they will face the leader, the Hearts, with whom they are separated by a difference of eight points.
But before that, the Rangers receive this Thursday the Vienna Rapid in the Europa League.
Livingston, meanwhile, extends his undefeated streak to six games in the league, with a Holt as coach who still doesn't know what defeat is since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston does not take advantage of its opportunities in the face of direct play by visitors
Holt's team should have gone ahead of the scoreboard long before the goal, as their direct play caused all kinds of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made his way between the defense, but wasted his opportunity when he found himself in front of the goalie. Then Alan Lithgow sent the ball out on stretching to try to finish Craig Halkett's header pass, which crossed the goalie.
The locals were already well off to let the Rangers approach their area, as they knew that they could put visitors in trouble in isolated plays.
And that’s how this decisive goal came about.
The referee whistled a foul against the Rangers' interests and Livingston made an opening to the band, where Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined so that Menga could play it first and finish from the central part of the area.
Up to that point, the Rangers had dominated possession, but found an impenetrable defense and a goalkeeper Liam Kelly who had very little work throughout the game,
The stage was repeated in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to make a stop of merit.
For his part, Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor stopped with his feet on one occasion from Scott Pittman and Lithgow ended up deflecting another combination play from Livingston.
The Rangers dedicated themselves to hanging one time and another in the Livingston area, only to be rejected. In addition, two penalties were claimed, one for an alleged entrance of Halkett to substitute Glenn Middleton, and another for hands. Both were dismissed.
Livingston "phenomenal": analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and great result for Livingston.
One man thinks they were excellent, and they continue to exceed all expectations in this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have hardly changed since his return to the top category, although much of the merit must be attributed to Holt for the way he has galvanized the team since his arrival.
There was a good bunch of heroes.
Captain Halkett was immense, leading a perfectly organized defense, while Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be Menga's underdogs throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration, however.
Despite the brilliant moments displayed with Gerrard as coach, they have definitely not been able to maintain the level.
They didn't know how to create occasions (only once they clearly overcame the local defense), and that the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table, should take it as a warning.
Turkey's reception for Erdogan in Cologne
All were smiles and clear skies on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany gathered for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the first day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which aimed to repair relations between the two NATO allies.
These had deteriorated due to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's entry into the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then moved to Cologne to inaugurate a new giant mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population in the world outside of Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of 25,000 people from congregating in front of the mosque, although a large number of followers gathered around to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an protesters, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
Both manifestations reflect the division of opinions around the visitor, considered a hero by some German Turks and titled dictator by others.
Deptford traffic accident: a cyclist dies in a collision with a car
A cyclist has died as a result of a collision with a car in London.
The accident took place near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, an area with heavy traffic from Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the vehicle stopped and, although paramedics attended the cyclist, he died in the act.
The accident comes months after another cyclist died in a runaway accident on Childers Street, 1.6 km from the scene of Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan police have said their agents are working to identify the man and report the events to their closest relatives.
The street has been cut and deviations have been applied for bus routes. In addition, drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison: six officers injured in altercation
Six prison officers have been injured in an altercation at this high-security men's prison, according to the center's office.
The events took place in Long Lartin Prison, Worcestershire, around 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday, and are still ongoing.
Specialized "tornado" agents moved to the scene to end the altercation, in which eight inmates were involved. The avalanche could be contained on one side.
Officers had to be taken care of for minor injuries to the face at the scene.
According to a prison service spokesman, "We have deployed specially trained prison personnel to try to solve an incident that occurred in Long Martin prison, which is still ongoing.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons. We are clear that those responsible for this altercation will have to be held accountable to the police and they may have to spend even more time in the jail."
There are more than 500 inmates in the Long Lartin penitentiary center, including some of the most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was learned that the head of the prison had to be cared for in a hospital after being attacked by a recluse.
In addition, in October of last year, anti-bullying agents made an appearance in prison to solve a serious altercation in which staff of the center was attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with major rivers (the areas with drought could be benefited)
It is not usual for a tropical depression to affect Arizona, but this is precisely what is likely to happen early next week when what remains of Hurricane Rosa passes through the southwest desert, with the consequent risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona as far south and east as Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to arrive directly in Phoenix on Tuesday and is expected to arrive on Monday night with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a statement that "only ten tropical cyclones have maintained the state of tropical storm or depression within a 322 km radius of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was 64 km from the Arizona border.
The most recent models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of rain, with isolated spots where up to 150 mm would be recorded in Arizona's Mogollon.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Central Rockies and the Great Basin, could record 25 to 50 mm, with the possibility of isolated points of up to 100 mm.
For areas that are at risk of flooding, the Rosa rain could become very good news, as the region suffers a severe drought.
Despite the fact that the rivers are a serious cause for concern, some of the rainfall could be very beneficial, as the southwestern region is currently suffering a drought.
According to the U.S. drought control service, more than 40% of the state of Arizona suffers at least extreme drought, the second highest category, according to weather.com.
But first, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa continued to have hurricane strength Sunday morning, with maximum winds of 137 km/h, and is now 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving northward at a speed of 20 km/h.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, causing it to lose strength.
Therefore, it is expected to hit land in Mexico with tropical storm force in the afternoon or evening on Monday.
Rainfall in different parts of Mexico could be strong, with a considerable risk of flooding.
According to weather.com, "a total of 75 to 150 mm of rain is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of reaching up to 250 mm."
After this, the Rose will head north crossing Mexico with tropical storm force, before arriving at the Arizona border early Tuesday morning with tropical depression force, to finally cross the state of Arizona and arrive in southern Utah well into the evening of Tuesday.
“The main risk we expect from the Rose or what is left of it is very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the Southwest Desert of the United States,” according to the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that the rains will cause dangerous floods and waste streams in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed to death in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday.
He was transferred to the hospital, where he is "stable".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested the next day in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset police.
The agents have made a call so that anyone who can have any kind of recording of the events with the mobile phone is contacted.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Suffered the Wickedness and Anger' of Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is the vote to reject the ruthless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said in an election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered the meekness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout its nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, bluntly and emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation of sexually abusing her decades ago, when both were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing in relation to his allegation.
The president said Saturday that, on that day, "the American people saw Kavanaugh's genius, human quality, and courage."
“The vote to ratify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to ratify one of the most brilliant minds in the legal world of our time, a lawyer with an admirable track record of service to the citizenry,” he said.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment while talking about the importance of the Republican voter turnout index in midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I didn’t run, but I actually did,” he said.
“That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for our great candidates.”
Trump argued that Democrats are devoting themselves to “resisting and obstructing.”
The first key procedural vote to be held in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place as late as Friday, an assistant to Republican party leaders has told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, where the death toll continues to rise
At least 384 people have died, and many have been dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches, due to a severe earthquake and tsunami that has affected the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday for a festival held on the beach in the city of Palu when waves of up to six meters hit the coast at dusk, dragging many of the people to death and destroying everything they found on their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat arrived yesterday, people were still carrying out their activities on the beach and didn’t run right away. That’s why they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster mitigation agency, said in a statement in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it wrecked everything on the ground,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved by open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before impacting the coast.
There are people who climbed up a tree fleeing the tsunami and were able to survive, he says.
Some 16,700 people had to be evacuated to 24 different centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster mitigation agency where you can see the number of shops and buildings destroyed, bridges turned and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
The replicas continued to shake this coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million inhabitants.
Indonesia's Technology Assessment and Application Agency (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's intense earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
According to the agency, the geographical characteristics of the city, located at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have exponentially increased the magnitude of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "considerable" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed.
The bodies of some of the victims, he said, were found trapped in the rubble of the collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
According to Nugroho, the deaths and damage could increase on the coast about 300 km north of Palu, an area called Donggala, closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
The communications "were completely paralyzed and therefore no information was received" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“It’s already a tragedy, which unfortunately could end up much worse,” he says.
The agency was strongly criticized on Saturday for not reporting the arrival of a tsunami in Palu, although officials said the waves arrived during the time the warning was issued.
In a recording of a fan shared on social media, it can feel like a man located on the top floor of a building gives desperate warning cries to the people on the street about the approaching tsunami.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water bursts into the sea, taking away buildings and vehicles.
Reuters was unable to immediately authenticate the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a widespread cut in the electricity supply that has disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Although the army has begun sending humanitarian aid on cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, the evacuees continue to desperately need food, in addition to other basic needs.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief work only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had planned to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
The situation is very serious.
Despite the fact that World Vision workers in Donggala were able to arrive safely and save money in the city of Palu, where the employees took refuge in canvas shelters installed in the courtyard of their office, during the journey they had to witness scenes of total destruction, says Doseba.
“I was told that they saw many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a catastrophe.
Although aid groups made the devastating gesture of starting relief work, some people complained that humanitarian workers were being prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the collection of funds, provisions and staffing from abroad can only begin to flow if the place where a disaster has occurred is declared a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“Once the government says, ‘Well, it’s a national disaster,’ we can start asking for international assistance, but that level has not yet been declared.”
As night fell on Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of the missing kept hoping the miracle would happen, and their loved ones shied away from the devastating tale of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a child was rescued in a sewer.
On Sunday, rescue teams freed a woman who had been buried under the rune for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which concluded earlier this month in Indonesia.
In addition to Mr. Mandagi, among the people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, there were his students.
“As a senior in the field of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon explained that, in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel among the paragliding community, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the competitors of Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
However, the messages appeared with a gray check mark instead of a blue double mark.
“I think that means that the messages were not received,” he added.
Thieves take $26,750 when filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's worker who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release issued by the Newport Police Department.
Agent Dennis McCarthy indicated in the statement that the driver of the vehicle was emptying the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing it to distribute more money.
While doing his job, another man "came running after the employee of Brink's" and stole a bag of money destined for distribution.
According to the statement, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
On Saturday, while announcing the change on Twitter, he wrote: "To be formally known as Kanye West."
A while ago in West, the 41-year-old motegen nicknamed Ye, and used this alias as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, which is expected to feature his new album, Yandhi.
The rapper replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her participation for "emotional reasons," according to the show's author.
Apart from being an abbreviation of his current stage name, West had previously commented that the word has a religious meaning for him.
“I think you’re the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means you,” West said earlier this year, speaking about the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
“So it’s you, it’s us.
I’ve gone from Kanye, which means the one, to simply Ye, which is a reflection of our good part, our bad part, our confused part, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
West is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Combs has been known by several names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborator, has earned his nickname with or without a script and in capital letters.
Mexico’s president, AMLO, vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s president-elect, Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians, when it is only a matter of time before the country celebrates the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised Saturday in the Plaza de Tlatelolco that "military force would never be used again to repress the Mexican people."
On October 2, 1968, the army opened fire during a peaceful demonstration and caused the deaths of 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were rooting out across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, who has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting monthly grants to students and opening more free public universities,
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities make young people feel attracted to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double the funds allocated to AI
“While China is increasingly active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of money it spends on research in this field,” said Kai-Fu Lee, an AI investor and professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government announced measures on AI, despite the country's general lack of a formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the world’s No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
“Duplicateing the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that the rest of the countries are far behind the US and we want to be the pioneers of the next advances in the field of AI,” Lee said.
“Duplicate funding could double the opportunities for the U.S. to achieve the next big AI discovery,” Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order, published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading AI companies.
In 1980 he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that outperformed the top-ranked American Othello player and subsequently served as an executive at Microsoft Research and as president of Google's Chinese branch.
Lee positively assessed previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would take place in order to identify future visionaries.
“U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get public scholarships,” Lee said.
According to Lee, “it’s not China that takes away the academic leaders; it’s the companies.”
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired university eminences to work in the field of AI.
Lee commented that the U.S. task in the field of AI could also be driven by changes in immigration policy.
“I believe that permanent residence cards should be automatically offered to PhD students in AI,” he added.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its state-of-the-art artificial intelligence development plan.
“The National Natural Science Foundation of China grants funds to people from academic institutions in the same way that the Natural Science Foundation and other U.S. public bodies give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower than in China,” Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense created a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to involve collaborators from the industrial sector and academic institutions, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the Natural Sciences Foundation, it currently spends more than $100 million a year on AI research.
Meanwhile, no measures have been implemented in relation to U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians hold a referendum to decide whether to change the name of the country
Last Sunday, the Macedonian people held a referendum on renaming the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's applications for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor constitutes a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has stated that he will not participate in the referendum, and a boycott campaign casts doubt on whether the minimum required participation of 50% will be reached for the referendum to be valid.
The question indicated in the referendum paper is: "Are you in favour of joining NATO and the EU, with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?".
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to achieve Macedonia's accession, one of the countries that was created following the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
“Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely in the European Union, because it means that all of us will have a safer life,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have stated that they will follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
To change the name, a two-thirds majority is required in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission reported that no irregularities had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% registered in the last parliamentary elections, held in 2016, in which 66% of registered people voted.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski said in Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum held in Macedonia on the country's name change, which would open the way for him to join the European Union and NATO in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the Parliament of Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small stage and placing chairs in front of the tents installed by the people who would boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to stick to it with our heads held high, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of the Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will be accompanied by more than necessary investments in Macedonia, which has a unemployment rate of more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will vote in favour, because more than 80% of the citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO,” Zaev said.
Zaev said a “yes” would mean “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Political Research Institute, between 30% and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, a figure below the minimum required participation.
According to the results of another poll, conducted by the Macedonian network Telma TV, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote “yes”.
For the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failure in the referendum would be the first hard time for the policy of the pro-Western government since it took over in May last year.
Watch the video: Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero, of Manchester City, makes a goal after haggling all the defense of Brighton
Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero and Raheem Sterling annulled Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City in the match played at Etihad Stadium, Manchester (England) last Saturday.
Aguero scored a goal in the 65th minute in a move that seemed ridiculously simple.
The Argentine forward received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He went for speed between three Brighton defenses, ravaging his way through the pitch.
Then, Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He bludgeoned a defense before surpassing a few more on the edge of the Brighton area.
Then he made a pass to his left that found Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball to the first touch, inside the area, at Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero, which with his right leg beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan, with a kick that was stuck inside the net on the right side.
“Aguero has trouble on his feet,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We decided to play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at that point.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League fight.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero received the ball in depth at Brighton Field and
He made a beautiful space pass through the left band towards Leroy Sane.
Sane drove the ball before passing it to Sterling on the long pole.
The Sky Blues forward finished the ball inside the net before exiting through the bottom line.
The City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage match on Tuesday at 6:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer, without options, wants to eliminate the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the play-off fight, there were not many reasons to force another opening.
But Scherzer, very competitive, hopes to get out to the pitcher's mound on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, in case the Rockies, who maintain an advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western National League, have a chance to play the play-off.
The Rockies secured a 5–2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but are still looking to secure their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play anything, at least we can come out and pitch knowing the atmosphere here in Denver, and knowing that the other team will probably play every point at the highest level, as no one has done this year.
“Why would I want to lose this game?”
The Nationals have yet to announce an opening pitcher for Sunday, but are apparently determined to let Scherzer pitch if that happens.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th opening, did a warm-up session on Thursday and would pitch on Sunday, his usual day off.
Washington's right-hander has an 18-7 record, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts on 220 2/3 entries this season.
Trump holds a rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big.. I don’t introduce myself, but in reality I do introduce myself. That’s why I’m everywhere fighting for the fantastic candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You can see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
They are determined to regain power by all necessary means, you see their meanness, their bad intention.
They don’t care who they hurt, above who they have to go to get power and control. That’s what they want: power and control. But we won’t give them.”
The mission of the Democrats, he said, is “to resist and obstruct.”
“And this can be seen in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “ugly, mean, brute and false.”
Trump mentioned Dianne Feinstein, the highest-ranking Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which led to a strong public writing.
“Do you remember his answer?
Did you filter the document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, uh, no. Wait a minute... This was a very bad body language expression, the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party must cease to be a diverse party.
He is intolerant of those who say what they think.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, I was not surprised.
After all, I am the last of a series of British parliamentarians who have told us that we are not welcome, let alone what we think.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she spoke out against anti-Semitism with determination.
In my case, with the motion of censure I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe. Ironically, these are similar issues with respect to which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In the notice of Friday's meeting of the Nottingham Labour Party, it was announced that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings held Friday night have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this is not the tone of many meetings, and the promise of “more generous and friendly” policies has long since been forgotten, if it ever existed.
It is increasingly evident that divergent opinions are not tolerated by the Labour Party, and each opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision expected me to turn 180o and take positions I would never have taken, either on national security or on the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public, say what I say, social networks are filled with aggressive messages in which a call is made not to renew my candidacy, center policies are denounced and I am told that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And that doesn’t just happen to me.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the messages I receive are usually political.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of the colleagues who have to deal with a torrent of sexist and racist attacks every day, and they do not get angry.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is to see how the level of abuse has normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn declared last week that the Labour Party should foster a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that diverse party, and with every motion of “no confidence” or every change in the rules of selection, the party gets more and more stark.
In the last two years I have received a lot of advice and have been advised to keep my head down, not to be so expressive and “everything would be fine”.
But I didn’t get into politics for that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, in my student days, spurred on by Thatcher’s careless government, which left my entire class literally sunk, I’ve tried to advocate for better public services for those who need it most, either as a local councillor or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way doubt my political positions and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who promoted the motion on Friday, I would say that at a time when the country is moving towards a Brexit that will harm homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to lose time and energy in my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But, in reality, the message I want to convey is not directed to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of renewal of my candidacy or any political interest will prevent it from acting, in my opinion, to the benefit of all your interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: unbeaten Ayr lead
Two last-minute trials distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that the Ayr deserved the victory in this vibrant Tennant's Premiership day game.
The Ayrs, who are the only undefeated team in the ten, occupy the first position on the classification table.
In the end, the local team prevailed thanks to their defensive superiority and the fact that they knew how to take better advantage of the opportunities, and coach Peter Murchie had reasons to be satisfied.
“The games we’ve played so far have put us to the test and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie said, “Congratulations to the Ayrs, they’ve taken advantage of the opportunities better than we have.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute trial, converted by Frazier Climo, put him ahead of the Ayr, but a yellow card for Scottish international Rory Hughes, conceded for the Warriors' game, allowed the Melrose to take advantage of numerical superiority and Jason Baggot scored a non-converted trial.
Climo extended the Ayr advantage with a penalty and, just in the middle, scored and converted a try to put the 17-5 score in favor of the Ayr at rest.
But the Melroses started well in the second half and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced the differences to five points.
Then, the match was interrupted for a long time due to the serious injury suffered by Ruaridh Knott, who retired in litter, and at the dam the Ayr again extended the distance with a Stafford McDowall trial converted by Climo.
Substitute Captain Blair Macpherson was then cautioned with a yellow card and, again, the Melrose took advantage of the superiority of one more man with an unconverted essay by Bruce Colvine at the end of a few moments of strong pressure.
However, the local team reacted and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to make a splash at Climo without a ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson scored a counter-attack behind the penetrating mole of the Ayr.
Climo scored, as he had done almost since the dam, after Kyle Rowe picked up a shot from David Armstrong and passed the ball to the third line at Gregor Henry's wing to score the local team's fifth try.
The star of the Still Game series seems ready to start a new career in the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, star of the Still Game series, appears to be about to move into the hospitality industry, after it has been discovered that he has been named director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays the character of Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and co-stars with Greg Hemphill, his long-time comic partner.
The duo have announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it appears that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although a source in The Scottish Sun newspaper noted that Kiernan intended to enter Glasgow's "flowering restoration sector".
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, without coastline, expects the court to reopen the route to the Pacific
The sailors patrol for their ship covered with squalls in La Paz.
The public buildings are decorated with a navy blue flag.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are emblazoned with the motto: “The sea is ours by right.
“Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia's landlocked territory, the memory of a lost coastline off Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the 19th century remains very vivid, as is the longing to re-navigate the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps the deepest in decades, while Bolivia awaits the resolution that the International Court of Justice will issue on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity, and, needless to say, awaits the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the TIJ resolution on big screens across the country, in the hope that the Hague Court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile is forced to negotiate the granting of a sovereign outing to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has many hopes laid in Monday's resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised last August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the Court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that, if it does, things would not change much.
The UN body based in the Netherlands has no power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The TIJ’s resolution, which comes just six months after the final allegations were filed, indicates the case “wasn’t complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean specialist in international law.
And far from being favored, the Bolivian cause may have experienced a setback in the last four years.
“The current Bolivian administration has hijacked the issue of access to the sea,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
“The belligerent rhetoric of Morales has undermined any gesture of goodwill on the part of Chile,” he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold talks after this episode.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was exceptionally fast.
Next Monday, Bolivia will have “an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile” and an opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements, with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America's most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political cross.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to realize that we must overcome the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not eliminate nuclear weapons if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
The minister urged the United States to keep the promises made during a summit held in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
Their statements come at a time when it appears that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume stagnant nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a chimera to think that continued sanctions and the U.S.’s objection to a declaration ending the Korean War could cause North Korea to never aggrandize.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration if Pyongyang does not make major disarmament moves earlier.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang taking seriously the issue of renouncing an arsenal that the country considers the only means to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest range of large hats, on the way to a main street near you
If you want to increase the size of your hat collection or you want to completely protect yourself from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented to the catwalk a range of extravagant hats of disproportionate size from their SS19 collection, which shone the style defined at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer Instagram has been razed by very impractical hats, and this designers have brought their amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino's highlight was an exaggerated beige hat, adorned with a wide, feather-shaped wing, which flooded the models' heads.
Among other oversized accessories, there were pillowcases, a witch hat, and even a pinyin, but these are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of extra-flavoured masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the masks, brightly colored, had sewn lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than high-waisted.
One creature resembled a complete underwater team, with a tube and glasses, while another resembled an ice cream cone.
And if you follow the great fashion trends, you’re in luck.
Style observers predict that huge hats could be implanted on the main streets near you.
The large hats step on the heels of "the bomb", a ball hat, with a wide two-legged wing, which everyone has worn, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the hat so impractical that it spread across social networks brought another great creation to the catwalk: a straw bag for the beach, almost as big as the model dressed in a swimsuit that wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia handkerchiefs and finished with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus’s La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famed designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I hope to see people wearing big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer. Given that the designer has made a big impact, it would be a shame to ignore the demand for large accessories.
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another series of excellent exam results, which is reinforced with individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other community efforts.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) strive to offer a service of the best level to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher studies, for the career they choose and for their place as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement a personalized school curriculum, we note that modern languages remain a very popular and desired subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, you will get to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is a very important reminder that we cannot depend only on English if we want to establish relationships and build trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s exams, we can see that languages lead the classification tables with the highest qualifications in independent schools.
68% of the students who studied foreign languages obtained a higher grade A.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS member schools reflected that 72% of students obtained a higher A rating in Mandarin, while 72% of German students, 69% of French students, and 63% of Spanish students also obtained an A rating.
This shows that Scotland’s independent schools support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, languages, as a subject of choice, are maintained in the same consideration as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in curricula from independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the Employment and Skills Commission of the United Kingdom revealed that of the reasons that employers gave for the fact that it cost them to cover the vacancies, 17% were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable to prepare young people for their future careers.
As there are more and more potential job opportunities that require languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that a person chooses, if he has learned a second language, he will have a real advantage in the future with a permanent competition like this.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation, and French, with 15% of speakers, was the only language with a double-digit percentage.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is important for today’s children.
Knowing several languages, especially those of developed economies, will give children better opportunities to find important work.
In Scotland, there is diversity among schools in terms of the languages they teach.
Some schools focus more on more traditional modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be more important for the UK in the future, towards 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interest of your child, you can always choose from a number of languages in independent schools, which have teaching staff specialized in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
In today’s global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered “international communication skills”.
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young Scots.
It has to be done.

LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the first preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
We still have to figure out what time he will play.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton told the Lakers.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a few minutes.
After early training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season matches at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a wave of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled for next week, which include visits to sympathetic sites such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the confirmation vote for his candidate to cover the Supreme Court vacancy is on hold, Trump aims to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you see it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
Trump’s rally in West Virginia can be seen online at the link specified below, via live video streaming on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the hearing that began this week with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was tense over the sexual abuse allegations he faces, while the Senate's expected confirmation vote remains on hold for up to a week and the FBI is investigating the case.
But the main goal of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans who run in the delicate November elections gain momentum.
The five meetings of President Trump’s campaign scheduled for next week are aimed at “stimulating volunteers and sympathizers, while Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as he can, as we head into a busy campaign season," a Trump spokesman said, declining to be identified.
Tonight’s rally, scheduled at the Wesbanco Arena, Wheeling, could rally supporters “from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate in the West Virginia Senate, who is getting unfavourable results in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come and give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows ambition to keep hopes alive for Sunday’s individual matches
After three uneventful sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes were probably what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of dynamics is an invented sports concept, in which players really believe, especially in competitions like this.
So on what side is the positive dynamic now?
“They had a six-point advantage and now it’s four, so I think we’re in a small positive bracket,” Spieth said as he left at the end of the day.
Obviously, Europe has an advantage, four points ahead, with twelve more at stake.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel that the wind blows a little in their favor and have many reasons to be animated, largely by the shape-shifting state of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day long and both have three points out of four.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and is setting an example.
The gutural shouts of celebration rose in intensity as he continued his lap and became a crucial putt to tie the fourth game, when he and Thomas had been two down after two holes.
He celebrated the putt that made them win the game in hole 15 with a similar scream, the kind that indicates he believes the American team is not yet out of the competition.
“You have to try your best and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for these players right now.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable sensation of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but adorable European couple wear four out of four and make no mistakes.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who didn't make a bogey Saturday afternoon, and also avoided the bogeys Saturday morning and Friday afternoon, and the last nine holes Friday morning.
For this result and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the bustling public, it is reaffirmed that it is the players who beat Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to close a possible European victory as the sun sets over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
However, talking about European glory seemed premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly ended up with Sergio Garcia, the morning furball hero, who partnered with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes sank the Spanish and Swedish into a hole from which they never had a choice to get out.
On Sunday, however, there is no one who can help you get out of the hole.
Furballs and fursomes are very fascinating to see by the interactions between pairings, the advice they give and the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change over and over again.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and will face the last day with an important advantage, but this foursome session has shown that the U.S. team has the motivation to fight that some, especially in the United States, had questioned.
Europe reaches the final of the Ryder Cup with a favorable score of 10-6
Europe will face the final day of the Ryder Cup with a comfortable advantage after finishing Saturday's fours and fours with a 10-6 victory over the United States.
The inspired duo formed by Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a great effort to achieve two victories against a struggling Tiger Woods and leave their record, so far, in four points at Le Golf National.
The European team, captained by Thomas Bjorn, who aspired to retain the trophy he lost two years ago at Hazeltine, dominated an undefeated American team in the morning heats and put the series in 3–1.
The U.S. showed more resistance to the Foursomes and won two games, but was unable to narrow the differences.
Jim Furyk's team needed to score eight points in Sunday's 12 individual games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four consecutive points, while he and Molinari, known by the nickname "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history.
After smashing Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs, they called for a brilliant performance to beat a deflated Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau for an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who had drawn in two games on Saturday, showed sporadic spurts of genius, but has lost 19 of 29 games in furballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning fourballs, teamed up again with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and fell 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, ranked first and third in the world, respectively.
However, Europe didn’t have it all figured out on a nice, windy day in southwest Paris.
Jordan Spieth, three-time tournament champion, and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans on Saturday by scoring two points.
They clinched a 2–1 win against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours, and later again won Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in the fours, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup had a team returned a four-point difference to individual matches, although Furyk's team, defending the title, only needs to tie to retain it.
However, after being second best for two days, it seems that a coming Sunday counterattack is out of his reach.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm “in any way” if no signs of confidence are seen
The North Korean foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were intensifying his distrust in the United States and that, under such circumstances, the country would not unilaterally eliminate its nuclear weapons in any way.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" during the previous year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear testing center, and committing itself not to proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology.
“However, we do not see any response in line with the United States,” he said.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and, in these circumstances, we will not initiate disarmament unilaterally in any way.”
While Ri took up North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization approach for which North Korea would reward as it gradually took action, his statements seemed significant because he did not reject full unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang had already done.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, in which Kim pledged to work on the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised assurances for North Korea’s security.
North Korea has tried to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has announced that Pyongyang must first eliminate its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted the call to relax the harsh international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that denuclearization must first occur and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, as well as opposing the “declaration of an end to the war,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions will make us kneel is a chimera of people who know nothing about us.
But the problem is that continued sanctions are intensifying our mistrust.”
Ri did not refer to plans to hold a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: “If the party involved in the denuclearization issue were South Korea instead of the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come out of this situation.”
However, the tone of Ri's speech was very different from what he held last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting U.S. territory with North Korean missiles was inevitable after President "Mr. Evil" Trump dubbed Kim a "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still much to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea denuclearized.
Last Wednesday, Trump said there was no deadline for this and that “it doesn’t matter if it takes two years, three years or five months.”
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without exception until we confirm total and definitive denuclearization.”
The Security Council has been pushing sanctions on North Korea unanimously since 2006 in a bid to cut funding for Pyongyang’s ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip didn’t go very well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying that progress had been made, but within hours North Korea accused him of making "a gangster's own demands".
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile center and a nuclear complex if the United States took “consonant action.”
He said Kim had told him that the “consonant measures” he was seeking were the security measures Trump had promised in Singapore, as well as actions toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Take a Course in Rest Habits
This year, a new course at Harvard University has allowed its students to sleep longer, in an attempt to combat the increasingly widespread culture of studying all night long, stimulated by caffeine.
One scholar observed that students at the world’s number-one university are often clued in to the basic aspects of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to create the course after giving a talk about the impact sleep deprivation had on learning.
“At the end of the talk, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are they telling me now, all this, in my last year?’
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, first implemented this year, explains to students the basic concepts of how good sleep habits improve academic and sports performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University's health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after learning that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The course, which is one hour long, includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a bedroom, where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, bamboos and books to receive information about the effects of caffeine and light, about how sports performance affects sleep deprivation, and about the importance of maintaining a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
Next, a campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily route.
“We know that the behavior of the students will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know, as one has the right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes,” Professor Czeisler said.
The culture of pride of staying up all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the growing pressure that students suffer make sleep deprivation an ever-increasing problem.
Making sure to enjoy a good quality sleep for long enough should be a “secret weapon” of students to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he added, even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation puts the brain in a mode of starvation and makes students always gain.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes in his final year during his first year at Harvard.
Raymond commented that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the course throughout the campus.
The next step, he expects, is to ask graduate students to undertake a similar program of study before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students take into account the fact of setting an alarm when they go to sleep and when they wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can alter the harmony of their circadian rhythm and cause problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal ends with Gerrard's men
Dolly Menga's goal condemns Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston's home that involves another blowout.
Ibrox's set was looking to add his first home win since last February's 4–1 Premier triumph at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team inflicted the second defeat on Gerrard in 18 games as a coach to leave his team adrift, 8 points from the Hearts, Lad's unstoppable leaders.
Menga scored the goal seven minutes before the half, and it never seemed that the Rangers, lacking inspiration, were about to equal the score.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rise to third position, behind the Hibernian by difference of goals.
And the Rangers could face more difficulties later, as line judge Calum Spence needed medical attention for a head injury caused by an object that apparently threw itself off the grid.
Gerrard made eight changes to the Ayr line-up in the Betfred Cup semifinals.
Holt, on the other hand, came out with the same eleven starter who scored a point against the Hearts last week. Surely, he felt satisfied with the way his well-organized team suffocated his rivals at all times.
While the Rangers dominated the possession, Livingston created more danger when they had the ball.
In fact, they should have scored in the two minutes of the match, when Menga's first intervention left Scott Pittman alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder felt deflected and missed the big opportunity.
A strong foul pitch by Keaghan Jacobs hit Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only made a deflected shot to the back pole.
The Rangers took control, but seemed to have more hope than faith in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos really believed that he should have had a penalty on the 15-minute signal, as he and Steven Lawless hit, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers led only two shots in the first half, but Ibrox's first goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, had no problem with Lassana Coulibaly's header and docile forward Ovie Ejaria.
While the Livi's first act in the 34th minute might have been against the race, no one can deny that they deserved it just for their effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs' hard-fought play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm to choose Menga for a simple end.
Gerrard acted on the break from changing Coulibaly for Ryan Kent. The change had a practically immediate impact, as the extreme made a pass at Morelos, although the imposing Kelly ran into the block.
However, the Livingstons continued to catch the attention of visitors by playing exactly as they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long passes, one after the other.
Holt's band may have given way to the final stages, but McGregor remained firm in rejecting Jacobs before Lithgow made a deflected shot from the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton still asked for a final penalty for a dispute with Jacobs, but again Thomson turned a blind eye.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago and counting... the day the physicist of the future, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger, was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually gave rise to the device we know as the "Geiger computer".
The Geiger counter, which has been a pillar of science ever since, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, seemingly failed cowboy physicists:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to find radioactive minerals, such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of atoms emanating from radioactivity on minerals.”
Evans: "Sure it's bursting now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Malignant Cells
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” and eliminate malignant cells
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Malignant Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves extracting a patient’s immune cells and altering them in the laboratory.
You can "see" a protein common to many cancers and then re-inject them.
A test vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw the disappearance of ovarian cancer that she had suffered for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting a patient's immune cells, altering them in the lab to "see" a protein present in many types of cancer (HER2), and then reinjecting them.
According to Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland: “The results we have obtained suggest that we have a promising vaccine.”
The HER2 protein “favors the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach consisting of extracting immune cells from patients and "teaching" these cells how to treat cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West got into a pro-Trump diatribe with a MAGA cap after his performance on the SNL show.
It didn't end well
Kanye West was written into the studio during Saturday Night Live after a chaotic performance in which he congratulated U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in the 2020 election.
After his third song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great Again cap, he began to criticize the Democrats and reiterate his support for Trump.
“Whenever I talk to white people, they say, ‘How can you like Trump if he’s racist?’
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago," he said.
The SNL program began with a parody of Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded West's recording of the disapproval on social media.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to ridicule West with the publication.
However, West has complained to the public that he was not well treated behind the scenes because of the hat he was wearing.
“They threatened me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on.
He was harassed.
And then they say I’m in a lower position,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the bottom line?” as he said he would put on Superman’s cloak so they wouldn’t be able to tell him what to do.
Try to love.”
His comments caused the audience to write at least twice and the members of the program team seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, that there was a reporter who explained to the publication: "The whole studio went completely silent."
West acted as a last-minute replacement for Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West left much of the audience perplexed with the performance of the song I Love It, disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West got the backing of the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR BRINGING OUT BETWEEN THE MULTITUDE."
But debate show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply "being who he is and that he is absolutely wonderful."
“But I have chosen not to reward anyone (including their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe adopts and spreads an ideology that harms my community.
He's free.
“Me too,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "the being formerly known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly known as Snoop Lion and the vanished Prince music legend changed its name to a symbol and, later, the artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder for stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after the stabbing of a man in East Belfast on Friday.
According to police, the incident took place in Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The prosecutor will review the charges.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington denounces toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for portraying the role of swordsman Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor has denounced the stereotype of a virile hero, saying that these roles hint that young boys often believe they must be strong to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times' Culture magazine, Kit said she believed "something had gone wrong" and that she was questioning how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married the co-star of Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, has admitted that she feels strong determination to face this problem.
“Personally, I’m now wondering where we’ve been wrong about masculinity,” she says.
“What have we taught men during their development in relation to the problem we are experiencing now?”
According to Kit, television can take some responsibility for the increase in toxic masculinity thanks to its so virile characters.
He added: "What is innate and what is acquired?
What is taught on television and in the streets that makes young boys feel that they should have this facet of manhood?
I think it’s one of the big questions of our time: how do we change it?
“Something has certainly been done wrong with the young boys.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not make any prequels or sequels to Game of Thrones when the end of the series is scheduled for next summer, saying he is fed up with battles and horses.
From November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his partner Rose is the best that has provided Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so she gave me my future family and my life ahead,” she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China notifies an increase in new cases of 14%
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health officials.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases are of sexual transmission, unlike what happened in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some regions of China due to infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV for this cause has been reduced to almost zero, according to statements from Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
Year after year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem for China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is common.
Taking into account the conservative values of the country, studies estimate that between 70 and 90% of men who maintain homosexual relationships will end up marrying a woman.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to the lack of adequate precautions for sexual relations.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies an employee leaked data from Republican Party senators and dispels “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information of three U.S. Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the demands were fueled by critics and far-right websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
Allegedly, the published information contained the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham, of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Thursday and was published by someone unknown to the Capitol during a Senate committee session on sexual abuse allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The information was leaked after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was related to Waters' office and revealing information from a Waters staff member, the Capitol reported.
“This groundless allegation is completely false and a pure lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised due to these false and fraudulent allegations, was not responsible in any way for this information leak.
This baseless denunciation is completely false and a pure invention.”
Waters' statement quickly generated online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of outrage,” Fleischer wrote.
"That makes you think you don't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they haven’t done, they shouldn’t be angry.
It doesn’t have to be challenging.
You don't have to question the accuser's motives.
You have to keep calm and calm.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Judge Kavanaugh's Democrats, whom critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday's session.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running to overthrow Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“Important if it’s true,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the relevant authorities and security forces to these fraudulent statements.
"We will make sure that the criminals are revealed, and that they will be made legally responsible for all actions that have been carried out and that have harmed each and every member of my staff."
Johnny English Strikes Again: Limited Spy Parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is already a tradition to look for references to Brexit in any new film with a British approach, and this remake of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise, which was born in 2003 with Johnny English and re-appeared in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn, is no exception.
This humorous self-satisfaction about how contemptible we are will be a new export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the incompetent out-of-eyes and rubbery face Johnny English has been able to renew for the second time his license to thaw everything. His name indicates more than anything else that it is a comic creation designed for non-English speaking territories with a tradition of going to the cinema.
Obviously, he is the stupid secret agent who, despite his rare claims to liquefied glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a point of Mr. Bean and a touch of this pair that adds a single note to the theme of Fire Cars at the inaugural ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
Originally, it was based on the mysterious international traveler Atkinson, who represented the now-forgotten television ads of Barclaycard, where chaos seemed to be everywhere.
There are one or two good moments in this last journey of JE.
I loved the Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propeller blades sticking out of the helmet.
It shows Atkinson's gift for physical comedy, but the humor seems rather fluid and strangely superfluous, especially since "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible now include comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems destined for children rather than adults, and for me the absurd adventures of Johnny English are not as witty or focused as the mute gags of the character Mr. Bean that Atkinson represents.
The repeatedly topical premise now is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret web spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, prompting the service agent's dismay, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last resort for a prime minister who is a pretentious and beleaguered figure, who already suffers a total collapse of lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson gives the best of herself with this character traced Teresa-May, but the script does not reach further.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as each active spy is put in danger, he will have to recover some of his retirement.
And that includes the disgraced Johnny English, now employed as a teacher at some luxury institution, but teaching off-the-shelf classes on how to become a covert agent, with some good gags, such as when English offers an espionage academy that looks like a rock school.
English is quickly returned to Whitehall for an emergency meeting with his patient Bough, a role he reprises as Ben Miller.
Now Bough is a married man, tied to the commander of a submarine, an enthusiastic role, in which Vicki Pepperdine is a little unprofitable.
Thus, the Batman and the Robin of when things get very bleak in the secret service of His Majesty go into action once again and find in Olga Kurylenko the spectacular "femme fatale" Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, represented by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of ridiculous insanity: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a French fast-food restaurant, sow chaos by smuggling aboard Volta’s luxury yacht, and English causes great confusion in trying to use a virtual reality helmet to familiarize itself with the inside of the house.
All the stops have certainly been drawn from this last sequence, but with all the simplicity and the noise it presents, it all looks like a children's program.
Pretty normal things.
As with the other Johnny English films, it has not been helpful to think whether the film industry has given Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan for the British to have a four-day work week and cover five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will have to consider a radical plan according to which the British will work four days a week and charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the heads of the companies to spend the savings obtained with the revolution of artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers giving them one more day of celebration.
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but receive the same amount of money.
According to the sources, the idea would fit with the economic agenda of the parties and plans to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
The change to a four-day work week is supported by the Trades Union Congress trade union confederation as a method for workers to profit from economic change.
An experienced Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
It won’t be overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration that fits the party’s perspective of balancing the economy in favor of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign.
However, the Labour Party does not support this aspiration in a joint manner at present.
According to a Labour Party spokesman, “A four-day workweek is not party politics and the party is not considering it.”
Shadow Minister John McDonnell used last week's party conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell expressed his determination to restore the power of "anonymous directors" and "speculators" to public service companies.
The minister's plans in the shadows also imply that shareholders in water companies might not recover the full investment, as the Labour government could apply "deductions" for the crimes it perceives.
It has also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create inclusive equity funds to deliver 10% of private sector firms’ shares to employees, who expect to pocket annual dividends worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tells "60 Minutes" if the FBI's Kavanaugh investigation could change their minds.
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and has raised the question of whether the agency’s findings could influence any Republican senator to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be published Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to light that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I’m serious,” Kennedy said.
“In the session I said that I had spoken with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it all happened and the accusations were made public, and I asked him if he had done it.
He was strong, determined and confident.”
But Graham's vote looks like it's on fire.
"I have my opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and I would file an explosive charge," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett flatly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And none of the people I name can verify that.
He's 36 years old.
I don’t see it changing anything.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Have you done anything to reduce poverty?
New York will host this Saturday the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event, which features an absolutely impressive star program, carrying out an equally impressive mission: eradicating poverty in the world.
In the seventh edition this year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people gather in the Great Lawn area of Central Park not only to enjoy performances such as those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the global goal of the extreme acabar event.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people who actively help fight it.
To receive a free ticket to the event (unless someone wants to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees had to do a series of tasks or "actions," such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other activity to raise awareness about the goal of the event.
What successes has Global Citizen achieved now that it has 12 years to reach its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a good way to persuade them to demand a call to action or just one more case of what we call “clictivism” (people who think they make the difference to sign an online petition or send a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who have helped achieve various goals.
It states that these actions have helped spur global leaders to announce commitments and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which will have influenced the lives of more than 2,250 million people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group mentioned 390 commitments and announcements derived from its actions, of which at least USD 10 billion have already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that so far protected funds have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include the The Power of Nutrition Foundation, a UK-based investor and maker association, which pledges to “help children grow as much as possible” and promises to send Rwanda $35 million to help fight malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Cizen.
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of Global Citizens, like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in 2018.
The group also explained that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to one of the P+F’s on their website asking “what makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard road. Sometimes, we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements of the past, we will triumph, because together we are stronger.”
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the artists who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will feature Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy as a "block" to hinder Russian energy exports (Secretary of the Interior)
Washington can, “if necessary,” turn to the Navy to prevent Russian energy from hitting markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke has denounced that Russia’s intervention in Syria, mainly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is their willingness to negotiate with energy, as they are doing in Eastern Europe, the southern flank of Europe," he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this issue.
“The United States has the capacity, along with the Navy, to ensure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, for the blockade, to prevent its energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed attendees at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the U.S.
He compared Washington’s strategies for negotiating with Russia and Iran, and noted that they are indeed equal.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is more or less to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he said, pointing out that Russia has only one resource, since its economy depends on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been on a mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the most economical option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to exit the “inadequate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump said turned Berlin into a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which has cost $11 billion and will double the capacity of the existing gas pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s staunch opposition to the project is simply due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers must be able to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. stance has prompted a negative response from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s main industry organisation, the Federation of German Industries (FDI), has called on the US to move away from the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will "detainedly" consider" her candidacy for president in 2020.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "detainedly" consider" her candidacy for president after midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider his candidacy.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix the government’s fracture, for women to hold high office,” he said.
"After November 6, I will take my candidacy for president seriously."
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump during the municipal meeting and stated that he was "carrying the country in the wrong direction."
“I am frankly concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been blunt in her criticism of Trump and his candidate for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said: “It is clear that an FBI investigation is needed before the election.”
However, a poll released Thursday showed that a majority of Warren’s own voters believed he should not be running for office by 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters have said the senator should not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll revealed wider support for the candidacy of ex-governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile names among Democrats who were considered in relation to a possible 2020 candidacy include Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially reveal his decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin cites PTSD sufferer Track Palin at Donald Trump rally
Track Palin (26) spent a year in Iraq after enlisting on September 11, 2007
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
“With what’s been happening to my own son since he returned, I can understand other families suffering from PTSD ramifications and some of the emotional wounds our soldiers are returning with,” he told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "the elephant in the room" and said the following of his son and other war veterans: "They come back a little different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there is respect for what their fellow soldiers and pilots, as well as any other member of the army, have given.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, with a declaration of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and DC support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence
Representatives from 18 states and the district filed a friend curiae Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who defied policy, according to NBC News.
The full name of the Grace vs Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and the sons of the violent gang member" assaulted her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers from states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of asylum seekers are generated in the U.S., as countries facing widespread gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board, which allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
Federal law requires that asylum claims be adjudicated according to the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle, according to the amicus curiae.
The lawyers also argued in the report that the policy denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide necessary jobs.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country for persecution or fear for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in his June 11 announcement of the policy.
Asylum has never sought to alleviate all the problems, not even the most serious ones, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as human losses multiply in a rush to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
“The environment is very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she reassured her fevered son at an evacuation center in the destroyed city of Palu.
“Every minute, an ambulance carries bodies.
There's no drinking water."
Residents have been seen returning to their destroyed homes to pick up flooded belongings and try to save what they can.
There are hundreds of wounded, and hospitals, crippled by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake, are saturated.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has fractured his shoulder, are outside Palu's military hospital, as patients are treated outside due to the strong shaking that is repeated.
Tears denied his eyes as he explained how the violent earthquake shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel where he was meeting his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save us.
He was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had attended a wedding in the village.
“I heard my wife asking for help crying and then I didn’t hear her anymore.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of being harassed with “propaganda ads.”
A week after an official Chinese publication published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China has accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
President Donald Trump addressed the China Daily payment supplement on Wednesday at The Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials have told Reuters is a new phase of Washington’s campaign to intensify pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to insert ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an intensifying trade war that has seen tariffs push up on each other’s imports.
China’s vengeful tariffs at the start of the trade war were aimed at punishing state exporters, such as Iowa, who supported Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, the long-time U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed article in The Des Moines Register of The Sunday: "It is doubling the harassment with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press."
“In divulging its propaganda, the Chinese government uses the esteemed American tradition of free speech and the free press by inserting a payment announcement into The Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, at the kiosk down the street here in Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and you will see no real reflection of the disparate views that Chinese citizens may have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers evaded the offer to publish" his article, but did not say the name of the publication.
Republicans set aside women voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
As many of the top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple sexual assault lawsuits, analysts have warned they will see a negative response, especially among women, to the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding this case are extremely high and most Republicans already officially show that they want to take a step forward with a vote.
These things cannot be undone," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse's Maxwell School, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s (R-Arizona) last-minute pressure to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday, tomorrow and in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., daily.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" as they marched into the Senate lobby as Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee decided to continue Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to the Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will stay out of the chart," Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst at the news site, told Reuters.
“People say they’ve been high; it’s true.
But there could have been more, especially among suburban women voters and younger 18- to 29-year-old voters who often don’t vote while they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, detailing his sexual assault claims to the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a negative response could occur if Republicans pressed for confirmation.
“This has become a boon for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the board vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh sits on the defendants’ bench. It also has to do with how Republicans have handled this issue and how they’ve treated it,” said Guy Cecil, director of US Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, to the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided between those who believe in Ford's stele and Kavanaugh's testimony, with the balance settling slightly toward the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents doubt or likely believe Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent say they doubt or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or unquestionably lied during his testimony, while 30 percent claimed the same from Ford.
After pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford and at least another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted him under the effects of alcohol when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the website, is launching a new company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s Solid Open Source platform.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people can access certain information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's hidden intention was to "dominate the world".
"We have to do it now," he said of the emerging company.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology to allow users to create their own "personal online data store" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify. They’re all available in one browser at a time.
What is exclusive of the personal online data warehouse is that the user is the one who decides who can access certain information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is for the company to integrate adequate resources, processes and skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company is currently formed by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM, some staffed developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that no one on his team is talking to Facebook and Google about whether to introduce a radical change where all business models are completely hollowed out overnight.
“We’re not asking permission.”
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website integrated into the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this new era of the web,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergy of the Victory Cross of the I GM
The only clergyman of the Church of England who won a Victory Cross during World War I as a combatant has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel and Reverend Bernard Vann was awarded the award on 29 September 1918 for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was shot down by a sniper four days later and never knew he had won the most important British military honor.
His two grandchildren unearthed a commemorative tombstone at a parade Saturday in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was "magnificently symbolic" that the tombstone would be presented exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning achievement.
According to The London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin Canal "through a very thick fog and under the intense fire of cannons and machine guns".
He later ran towards the line of fire and, with "the utmost courage", advanced the line before hurling himself over a cannon with one hand and leaving three members of the detachment stunned.
The lieutenant colonel was shot down by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann (72) said that his grandfather's actions were a feat he could never match, which gives you a sense of humility.
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also left a crown after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the value of a true hero is demonstrated by support he will receive from many people.
MMA fans who stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, saw the Peppa Pig instead
Imagine staying up all night to watch Bellator 206 and being denied the most important event.
The San José cartel contained 13 fights, including six from the main card and had to be seen live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6:00 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the match, UK viewers were stunned when the schedule changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were disgusted to have spent the night awake until the morning to see the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to the cartoons as "a sort of vomiting acuity".
“Government regulations say that at 6:00 this content is not appropriate, so they changed to children’s programming,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the rebroadcast.
"Shut the fuck up, yeah."
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they would work on programming to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on a Sunday and we won’t be able to solve it until Sunday at our own time, Monday at yours.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when I switched channels, there were a lot of messages coming and going, and not everyone was nice.
We tried to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't. It was a government problem.
I promise it won't happen again.
We will leave it in five fights, instead of six as we normally do. We tried to show it again for the followers, but it was over.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Lesser’ About Sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley claims to have grown up feeling inferior to the rest of the people because of his sexuality, but that this provided him with the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete has stated that he did not realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like him.
On Radio 4's Desert Island Discs program, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give "hope" to other people.
He also said that being a father had remained important to him in winning the Olympic Games.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as a dyke on Laverne's first show, said he felt "less than" others because "it was not socially acceptable as boys and girls".
He said: “Today, those feelings of inferiority and difference have been real things that have given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that it was “something,” he said, so that no one would be disappointed when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile promoter of the LGBT movement and has used his image at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he had spoken because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give "hope" to other people.
The three-time world champion explained that he had fallen in love with a man, the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, "took me by surprise".
Last year, Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years his senior, but he says the age difference has never been a problem.
According to him, when you go through it when you are young (he participated in his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it is difficult to find someone of the same age who has experienced similar highs and lows.
The couple were parents in June of a child to whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley. According to Daley, "all his perspective" has changed.
“If you had asked me last year, all I needed was to win an Olympic gold,” he said.
“There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 due to brain cancer.
According to Daley, his father did not accept that he had to die and one of the last things he asked for was if they already had the tickets for London 2012, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you're not going to be in the front row,'" he said.
"As I held his hand, he stopped breathing and it wasn't until then, that he was already dead, that I finally accepted that he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won the bronze.
“I knew that was what I had dreamed of all my life: jumping in front of a crowd at home in an Olympic Games. There was no better feeling,” he said.
He also inspired the selection of his first song (Heather Small's Proud), which he had heard during preparation for the Olympics and which still gave him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson made it to the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will break a record Sunday for his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he will have to change his physical condition if he doesn’t want to become an unhappy milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event to break a record for the 12th time, was introduced by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's "fourballs" and "foursomes" modes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as has been usual for the United States, the winner of five major tournaments divides his time between cheering and working on his game on the pitch, hoping to rectify what hurts him.
He has never made the most direct drivers, not even at the height of his career, but the 48-year-old is not the ideal option for the difficult trajectory of Le Golf National, where the long rough usually punish the deflected kicks.
And if his own trajectory is not discouraging enough, Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, will face the precise British Open champion, Francesco Molinari, who has joined rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 individual games, start strong, Mickelson’s game could become absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in this man, unable to say much more.
“He perfectly understood his role for that day, patted me on the back and surrounded me with his arm as he told me I would be ready the next day,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
It’s a hall of fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I couldn’t imagine playing two games.
I imagined more, but that’s how I trained and that’s how we thought we had to move forward.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup games played.
It can mean the end of a race in the Ryder Cup that has not matched your individual record.
Mickelson has scored 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought intangibles to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make fun of people and he’s a great teammate,” he said.
“I think the younger players also had fun hanging out with him this week, which has been fun to watch.
He brings a lot more than his game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows the advantage may soon fade
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that starting with a considerable advantage the individual duels of the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough day.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, when the team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point advantage over the American team, but in the end they achieved victory by the minimum, 14.5-13.5.
“And you keep reminding us that we had a great advantage at Valderrama; we had a great advantage at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but little by little,” Bjorn said in the image, after seeing the team’s 2018 win by 5-3 as much Friday as yesterday, which leaves the National 10th in Le Golf.
The story has taught me and all the team members that it is not over yet.
Tomorrow we have to go to the machine.
You have to go out and do everything right.
This doesn’t end until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal, try to win the trophy, and we have to keep the concentration to do it.
I’ve said it before, I focus on the 12 players we have on the team, but I also have an idea of who our rivals are: the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the performance of his players on a demanding golf course, Bjorn added: “I will never rush into this.
Tomorrow will be different.
Tomorrow the individual performance will make a difference and change everything.
It’s great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but individual duels put your golfing skills to the ultimate test.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
At this moment, you leave your partner and he has to go out and get the best out of himself as well.”
Unlike Bjorn, rival captain Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk knows both sides of the coin about last-day setbacks, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up losing in the "Miracle of Medinah" that won Europe.
“I remember exactly all the words,” he answered the question about how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, motivated his players before the last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but we want to start with good footing, as we saw in Brookline and Medinah.
When there is a team that is inspired, a lot of pressure is generated in these central duels.
We have prepared the alignment according to the circumstances and the best way to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas is challenged to attempt a comeback against Rory McIlroy in the main duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the rest of the Europeans in the first half of the order.
“I have chosen this order because I think it covers all possibilities,” Bjorn says of his selection for the individual matches.
Germany's new warship, postponed again
The new frigate of the German Navy should have been completed in 2014 to replace the old warships of the Cold War era, but it will not do so, at least, until next year after faulty systems and an increase in cost, according to local media.
The completion of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but post-construction problems have set the terms of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the former Bremen-class frigates.
It is believed that it will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technology against stealth actions, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other highlights include longer periods between maintenance: it should be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years without passing through national ports.
However, these continued delays imply that the state-of-the-art ships, which were predicted to be able to project into Germany as a powerful force abroad, will already be obsolete when they come into operation, according to Die Zeit.
The unfortunate F125 frigate was already news last year, when the German Navy rejected the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder once it had been delivered.
Few details of the reasons for his return are known, but the German media have cited several "material and technical defects" of the ship that made it unusable if used in combat missions.
Technical problems are important, as about 120 sailors, half of the crew needed for the former Bremen-class frigates, operate on Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships.
In addition, it has also been known that the weight of the ship is excessive, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to add future improvements.
The 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to weigh twice as much as similar class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the defective materials, the cost of the project, which includes the training of the crew, also begins to pose a problem.
It is believed to have reached an astonishing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) from an initial budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems of the new frigates have become a matter of special importance, given recent warnings that Germany's maritime military power is weakening.
This year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament's defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy "is running out of ships that can be used".
The official said the situation has worsened over time because the old ships were no longer used, but no new ones were provided as replacements.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could join the Navy.
The National Foundation spies on the secret life of bats
A new research carried out on a Scottish Highlands farm aims to find out how bats use the landscape to feed themselves.
It is expected that the findings could provide new data on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help in future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Foundation of Scotland will continue to be soprano and common bats, as well as northern eared bats and water bats in the Inverewe Botanical Garden, located in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations of the property to keep track of the activities of the bats during the season.
Volunteers and staff from the UK’s National Health Service will also conduct mobile surveys with portable detectors.
The sound analysis of the recordings by experts will determine the sound frequency of the bats and what each species does.
With this information, a report and a habitat map will be created to create a detailed picture of the landscape of your behavior.
Rob Dewar, Natural Conservation Advisor at the National Foundation of Scotland, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation, and how to improve forest maintenance for bats and other associated species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom has declined considerably in the last century.
Building construction and restoration tasks threaten bats, as they affect nests and can cause habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do sledgehammers and chemical treatments used in building materials, as well as domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they have to catch a prey.
They use a sophisticated echo localization technique to locate insects and obstacles that interfere with their flight.
The National Foundation of Scotland, responsible for taking care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten experts with the proper training, who carry out surveys, nest inspections and, sometimes, rescues on a regular basis.
The organisation has even created Scotland's first and only rattan reserve at the Threeve Estate, located in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten rattan species.
The estate's administrator, David Thompson, claims it is the ideal territory for the species.
“Here at Threeave, we have a big area for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and quite a good habitat.
But we still don’t know many aspects of bats, so the work we do here and other properties will help us better understand what they need to grow.”
It notes the importance of checking whether there are rattans before carrying out maintenance tasks on property, as it may be that the possible involuntary destruction of a single maternity nest kills more than 400 females and young, which could result in the disappearance of an entire local population.
The bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, attack them, disturb them and destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an official at the Scottish Rat Conservation Foundation, has encouraged people to take a step forward to help.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn from bats and, in the case of some of our species, we don’t have enough data on their population.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as his lawyers prepare a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has indicated that the rape allegations against him are "fake news" and has said people "want to become famous" thanks to his name.
His lawyers will sue the German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, which is responsible for publishing the charges.
Portugal and Juventus have been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He allegedly paid at the time $375,000 for the incident not to be made public, according to information published Friday by Der Spiegel.
In an Instagram Live video targeting his 142 million followers hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, claimed they were "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today, fake news,” the five-time Golden Pilot winner says on camera.
“They want to be famous because of my name.
It's normal.
They want to use my name to make themselves famous, but it’s part of my job.
I'm a happy man and everything is in order," added the player, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are already preparing the lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have described as "inadmissible information of suspects about private life," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz has said the player will seek compensation for "moral damages for an amount corresponding to the seriousness of the infringement, which is probably one of the most flagrant personal rights infringements in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a Las Vegas Palms hotel and casino suite.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to reports filed in the Clark County District Court, Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him he was a "99% good guy", except for a "1%".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had sex, but were consented.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and was photographed in hospital, but later accepted an out-of-court settlement because she was "fearful of reprisals" and worried about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says she is seeking to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to sign for Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged incident and this summer has signed for Juve, the Italian giant, in an operation of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK ‘would always regret’ losing automakers
The UK “would always regret it” if it lost its status as a world leader in post-Brexit manufacturing, according to Greg Clark, Secretary of Economic Affairs.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota's UK base had told the BBC that if the UK left the European Union without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at the Burnaston factory near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer has indicated that the impact of delays at the borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cause job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis models, produced 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Leaving the EU without any agreement on how trade with other EU countries will work has raised fears from other UK car manufacturers, such as Honda, BMW, Jaguar and Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close the Mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are related to what manufacturers consider risks in the production chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is carried out on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from UK and European Union suppliers for the manufacture of automobiles.
If the UK leaves the European Union without reaching an agreement on 29 March, there may be unrest at the border, which the sector believes could generate delays and shortages of fish.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep inventory for more than a day at the Derbyshire plant, according to the company, and production would have to stop as a result.
Clark says Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “calibrated precisely to avoid these border controls.”
"We have to come to an agreement. We want to get the best deal that allows us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The tests not only from Toyota, but also from other manufacturers, indicate that we need to be able to continue with a successful set of production chains.”
Toyota has not been able to confirm how long production would stop, but in the long run it has warned that the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and could cause job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the coordinator of Unite the Union at the plant, said members are beginning to be very concerned about the situation: “By experience, when these jobs are lost, they never come back.”
A government spokesman said: “We have designed a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
According to the White House, the meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be delayed again.
Donald Trump's expected meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could "marry a week" as the fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, in White House statements on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, Russian links to Trump’s aid, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump fired the deputy attorney general and put Mueller’s independence at risk has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
This month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of carrying a microphone to record conversations with Trump and also the possibility of deposing the president with the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he went to the White House amid rumors he was about to resign.
However, a meeting with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump has said he would "prefer no" to dismiss Rosenstein, but postponed the meeting to avoid a confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing that witnessed Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the entire Senate vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied as follows: "No date has yet been set, it could be this week, although it may take another week for all matters with the Supreme Court to be delayed.
But we’ll see. I always like to keep the press informed.”
Some journalists might refute this claim: Sanders has not held a briefing at the White House since September 10.
Presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the lack of informative sessions was not because he did not like the bragging of television journalists, although he said: "I will not deny that they are bragging."
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president,” he said, before adding the following without citing any source: “We’ve looked at this data.”
Sanders has stated that the briefings will continue to take place, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it’s far infinitely better than talking to me.
We try to do it often, you’ve seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and they’ll replace the briefings when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries on official visit.
Individual press wheels are infrequent.
This week, in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, after an informal and at times strange appearance in front of the assembled journalists.
The Secretary of Health writes to the EU workers of the Scottish National Health Service on fears of Brexit
The Secretary of Health has written to EU staff working at the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and wishes them to continue after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months after the UK's departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the cost of applying for a state of residence for EU citizens working in delegated public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the departure have continued, and everything seems to be heading towards the decisions expected this fall.
But the UK government has also begun preparations in the event of a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this is a stressful time for all of you.
Therefore, I would like to reiterate that I greatly appreciate the contribution of all staff members, regardless of their nationality.
EU partners, and beyond, provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, while benefiting patients and the communities we treat.
Of course, Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee State Tigers' relay has undergone an emergency operation after suffering a head injury on Saturday in the 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to information from the Tennessee Mike Organ.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed said in a statement that the injury occurred shortly before the midterms.
"He came on the sidelines and collapsed there," Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the band before putting him on a litter and taking him in order to test him further.
A Tennessee State officer has informed Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type or extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is investigating when the injury occurred.
It is the first season of Abercrombie's second year with Tennessee State after signing from Illinois.
He had completed five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, making a total of 18 this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK with the extra money used to help homeless people according to the Conservative Party’s new plans.
This action will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s movement to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will be taxed on those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
Hisenda hopes to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
A higher stamp duty is expected to be levied on foreign buyers when buying a property in the UK and this money will be used to help the homeless, a measure Theresa May will announce today.
This action is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's movement to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing that would affect higher incomes.
The increase in stamp duty will be taxed on those people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK; this money will go to government action to combat the numbers of homeless people.
The surcharge, which will be added to the current stamp duty, including the highest levels introduced two years ago in second homes and real estate speculation, could be up to 3%.
Hisenda expects to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s newly built properties are non-British residents, which increases prices and makes it difficult for new buyers to open up to the property scale.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new measure comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp duty to help young people get their first home.
He accused the large constructions of keeping property prices high by buying land quickly and not using it, and urged May to cancel the quotas on affordable homes to correct Britain's "real estate disaster".
Corbyn has announced a series of attractive proposed real estate reforms, such as rent controls and the termination of "no-fault" denunciations.
It also wants to give more power to the city councils to build new homes.
May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream: life must be improved for every new generation.
And that means correcting our broken real estate market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be right that it is equally easy for people who do not live in the UK, as well as for companies based abroad, to buy housing compared to British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home is too distant and the indignity of the homeless makes it all the more real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ambition is to train Scotland’
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has stated that his "maximum ambition" is to be Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old has accepted the challenge of reviving the northeastern club, which currently occupies the third position in League One, three points from the leader.
He arrived at the Stadium of Light this summer after returning St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
I was called once as a supporter and that's all," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme.
“But I grew up watching a lot of Scotland play Hampden with my dad when I was a kid and it’s always something that takes me back in time.
This opportunity will only come to me if I succeed in training in clubs, however.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn't feel the pressure to be next on a list of names consecrated to such a great team, having previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, my criteria for measuring my success will be whether I can bring this team back to the Premier League.
With the structure and facilities of the club, it is clear that their place is the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get there, but I would only consider myself successful here if I can bring the club back.”
Ross has only three years of experience as a coach, after a period as a second coach at Dumbarton and 15 months in the Hearts technical corps.
He helped Alloa avoid falling into the third category and transformed the St Mirren from fighting for the salvation of Championship champions the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than during his stint as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a decisive moment,” he recalled about accepting the position at Alloa.
“I always thought training was the best thing I could do, rather than playing.
It sounds strange because I did it well, I got out reasonably and enjoyed quite a good time.
But playing can be very difficult.
There are many things you have to overcome every week.
I still do it in aspects like stress and work pressure, but I feel good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now I’m doing it, it’s the most comfortable time I’ve felt since I was an adult.”

The perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, according to a study.
The summer heatwave has boosted consumption in Britain’s struggling bars, but has added more pressure to restaurant chains.
Bars and bar chains saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant consumption has fallen by 4.8%, according to statistics.
Peter Martin, of CGA financial advisory, the company that collected the data, states the following: "The continuous sunshine hours and England's participation in the World Cup, which has been extended more than expected, have made July follow a pattern similar to that of June, with the increase of 2 percent.
The 1.8% reduction in consumption in restaurants in June has worsened in July.
Bars and taverns, led by beverage consumption, have achieved the best results, while consumption in restaurants has gone down.
The bars that offer food have also suffered from the sun, although it has not been as dramatic as in the case of restaurants.
People just wanted to go out and drink.
In the bars and taverns we have consulted, beverage sales have increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales have decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM’s leisure and hospitality analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The time and impact of major social or sporting events continue to be the main factors related to external leisure market sales.
It’s no surprise that restaurants continue to have problems, but a 4.8% year-on-year decline in sales would be especially damaging, rather than the continued pressure on costs.
This long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for shops serving food and the weather will tell if the more moderate temperatures we’ve had in August will provide this much-needed breath.”
The total increase in sales of bars and restaurants, including those recently opened, was 2.7% in July, indicating a slowdown in the presentation of brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker sector sales indicator for UK restaurants, bars and taverns collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operator groups, with a combined loss of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 million and is the industry’s established benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that hide from their parents.
One in five children, some 11 years old, have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, according to data from a survey.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated an increase in the "false Insta" pages
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content
20% of students say they have a “principal” account that they show to parents
One in five children, some 11 years old, create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students has indicated a rapid increase in "fake Insta" accounts, a reference to Instagram, the site for sharing photos.
The news has raised fears about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students say they have a clean "main" account that they show to their parents, while they also have a private one.
A mother who discovered her 13-year-old daughter's secret account saw a message from a teenager urging others to "rape me."
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Committee of Directors of Private Schools (HMC) of independent schools, has revealed that 40% of adolescents between the ages of 11 and 18 have two profiles, half of whom have admitted to having private accounts.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voices of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Federation's directive
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Federation's board at the organisation's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the field and track athlete with the most medals in Scotland and President Ian Beattie described the movement as a great opportunity for those who lead the sport to benefit from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has the respect of the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletics will benefit from its inclusion in the directive," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am very much looking forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to grow the sport and contribute to Scotland."
The American, who won gold in the 200 and 400 at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, between a total of four Olympic golds and is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, was prevented from walking after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I suffered a brain drain.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I can recover or to what extent.
It has been exhausting, but I have recovered completely, I have learned to walk again and today it is time to do agility exercises!
“Thank you for your messages of encouragement!”
A cartoon ad comparing mothers to cows divides opinion on the Internet
A stripper company has divided opinion on the Internet with an ad that compares nursing mothers with cows that are munching.
To mark the launch of what is considered the “world’s first silent handgun,” consumer technology company Elvie has released an ad inspired by a music video prank to show the freedom that the new handgun gives to the seas.
Four royal mothers dance in a barn full of rags and cows to the rhythm of a song that includes lyrics such as: "Yes, I'm munching on myself, but you won't see any tail" and "If you hadn't noticed, they're not cockroaches, they're my boobs."
The return continues: "Bomb, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, feed the girls."
However, the ad, posted on the company's Facebook page, has caused controversy on the Internet.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received a mix of reactions from those who have seen it, many of whom claim it shows the "horror" of the dairy industry.
“It’s a bad decision to use cows to advertise the product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, with the difference that they are separated from their babies a few days after giving birth,” one person wrote.
The Elvie pulley is hidden discreetly in a lactation holder (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented the following: "Understandably traumatic for the mother and baby.
But why not use them to advertise a slingshot for mothers who will keep their babies?”
Another user added: “It’s an off-site ad.”
Other people defended the ad; a woman admitted that she found the song "fun".
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would buy one if I still had to breastfeed.
Pumping for the rifle made me feel exactly like a cow.
The announcement is a bit crazy, but you have to take it as it is.
It’s a great product,” one user wrote.
Another person commented: "It's a fun ad for mothers who pump with pulleys (usually at their workplace or in the washroom and feel like they're cows.
It is not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women show that they have all danced with the strap discreetly tucked into the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the perception many women say they feel like they are cows when they use the pulley.
However, the Elvie pulley is completely silent, has no cable or tube, and discreetly fits into a lactation holder, giving women more freedom to move, subject babies, and even get out while pumping.
Ana Balarin, a partner and early childhood developer at Mother, said: “The Elvie stroller is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative campaign.
In drawing the parallels between women and cows, we wanted to show the public how a pulley is used and the challenges it entails, while demonstrating, in an entertaining and didactic way, the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new pulley.
This isn’t the first time Elsie has been in the news.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained migrant children has increased even though monthly cross-border admissions have remained virtually stable, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made child sponsorship difficult.
Traditionally, most godparents were undocumented immigrants, who have been afraid to risk their chances of staying in the country if they decided to take a child.
The risk has increased since June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adults living in their homes will have to send fingerprints, which will be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to take in unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of the people who have hosted or live in the home of a person who has hosted are in the country illegally, and a large majority of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we will continue to persecute these people,” Albence said.
To prosecute children more quickly, officers have introduced new rules that require some to appear in court within a month of being held, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard, according to shelter workers.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than face-to-face, to defend their case to obtain legal status in front of an immigration judge.
All those who are not considered fit for help will be deported immediately.
The longer children spend in custody, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can generate violent rampages or escape attempts, according to workers and reports the system has made public in recent months.
Lawyers say these concerns may intensify in larger facilities, such as Tornillo, where, because of their size, signs indicating a child is suffering are more likely to be overlooked.
They added that moving the children to the camp without having time to prepare them emotionally or say goodbye to friends can cause them a trauma that many already suffer.
Syria Urges U.S., French and Turkish “Occupational Forces” to Retire Immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem called on Syrian refugees to return home, despite the eight-year-long war in the country.
Muallem, who also acts as deputy prime minister, has said that foreign forces were on Syrian territory illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "the matter will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Muallem has insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and the conflict has caused millions of displaced people.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this sacred battle until we have purged all Syrian territory" of both terrorist groups and of "any foreign illegal presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to train and advise Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground of a war-torn country.
On the refugee issue, Muallem said conditions were good for his return and blamed “some Western countries” for spreading “irrational fears” that make refugees want to stay away from him.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
"They're politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian."
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats have said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a neutral zone in the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, has fostered the opportunity to continue with the political meetings.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian forces with the help of Russia in the province, where three million people live.
However, Muallem noted that the agreement has "clear terms" and expressed hope that the military action will face the jihadists, who include fighters from the al-Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda, who "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, a UN envoy, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee made up of members of the government and the opposition soon to begin shaping a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Muallem outlined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, whose task should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned of possible interference.
Why Trump will win for the second time
According to this logic, Trump would win the 2020 election again unless, as many liberal viewers probably expect, the scandals and the impeachment process end his presidency prematurely.
That would be, without a doubt, “the end of a more dramatic presidency in history.”
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of on-call viewers has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million on-call viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has led cable television audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
“People have been pushed into it because they don’t understand it,” says Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor” series, about a cabinet secretary who becomes president when an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride to Boston before the 2016 election?
The taxi driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” he asked.
“He told me that because it made him laugh,” Scovell told me.
There is a point of entertainment in chaos.
Of course, unlike television shows, the script coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can reunite and the state of the world economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, to be an informed citizen is to go further when you find yourself in the sixth hour of Daniel's time to see a group of experts discuss the use that Bob Woodward has made of sources "for private use" for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's 15,000-dollar ostrich leather jacket ("a piece of rag like his own").
In my case, I will never look the same as Super Mario again.
“Part of what makes it seem like I’m part of a reality TV show is that every night gives you something new,” says Brent Montgomery, executive director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars” about the character changes and script twists of Trump’s show (fighting with the NFL, loaring Kim).
You can’t afford to miss an episode because you’re left behind.
When I saw Fleiss this week, there was a temperature of about 25 degrees and he was alone outside the house he has on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
It could not be undone, not with Brett Kavanaugh about to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
“I remember when we did those shabby programs back then and people said it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it would be some kind of joke, but it looks like they were right.”

Foreign money floods mid-term elections races in the House of Representatives more tight
It’s no surprise that there’s a cash flood in Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the realignment of congressional districts that has forced two current members to compete for the same square.
This recent reassignment of the suburban Pittsburg district involves Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won the seat in another district after a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another current representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's former 12th district, which conflicts with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a financial war between the party's main financial organizations, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb made a name for himself in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a closely watched special election held in March to represent Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
Republicans have held office for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States imposes sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China, but withdraws them
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little response from Washington.
Trump held a tense meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valera in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until his partners kicked out the Trump Organization management team.
State Department officials decided to withdraw the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama for "recent decisions on whether to stop recognizing Taiwan," Heather Nauert, a spokesman for the department, said this month.
However, only the possibility of sanctioning El Salvador, which received in 2017 US aid of 140 million dollars, according to estimates, for the control of drug trafficking, development and economic improvements was contemplated.
The proposed sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on visas issued, would be detrimental to the Central American country and the high death toll from murder and unemployment.
With the passage of internal meetings, officials from both countries postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting held last year that was seen as a step forward in preventing migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials clarified that they wanted the meeting to take place, effectively ending any likelihood of sanction for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has been chosen for the meeting, now scheduled for mid-October, as a sign of how important the administration is, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. envoys discreetly returned to their posts in El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton's White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations since anonymity.
An external analyst, close to the administration and also from anonymity, corroborated the statements.
Studying History
The next event to occur could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is ample evidence in public records.
Mueller is also investigating whether the Trump campaign collaborated with Russia in its attack on the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump could find himself accountable to the organization, just as he prepares to do so in front of voters, and even in front of a jury of party members.
There are many circumstantial conditions, and I do not want to suggest that the fall of Trump, nor of any of his European namesakes, is inevitable.
There are decisions to be made on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect how long the situation will last.
In 1938, German officials were willing to stage a coup against Hitler, only if the Western bloc had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid all the years of terror that followed.
The course of history fluctuates on points of inflection like this and the inexorable progress of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
The United States is currently facing several turning points.
What will happen if Trump sacks Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been with the water in his neck since that newspaper reported that, last year, he suggested secretly registering the president and speculated that he was not fit for office.
Rosenstein says the Times' information is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if it is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and false testimony?
And, especially, will we vote in the middle of the legislature a Congress that will make Trump responsible for it?
If we do not overcome these tests, democracy will begin to run the risk.
But I don’t think we’ll fail, because I’ve already learned the lesson in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that occupied the ambassador’s house.
He survived, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light Saturday candles on that table with the swastika.
With this baggage, how can I not be optimistic about the future?”

Graham Dorrans, from the Rangers, optimistic about the match against the Vienna Rapid
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, aware that a win against the Austrians, after an impressive draw at the Vila-real field this month, would leave him in a good position to qualify for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing the first few minutes of the season until the 2-2 draw against Vila-real, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for great results.
“It was a positive point for us, because Vila-real is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We played the game believing we could get a valuable result and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have pulled something more off in the end, but overall, the draw was probably a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but we were better than them in the second.
On Thursday, it's another big European night.
We hope we can stay with the three points, but it will be a difficult match because they pulled a good result in the last game, but I am sure that we will give it all and achieve a good result with the support of the fans.
Last year was really tough, with the injuries I suffered and the changes at the club, but now it’s a good place to be.
The team is good and the guys enjoy it, the trainings are good.
I hope we can give it our all, leave it behind last season and be successful.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of retirement savings.
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked about it with the family.
About half of respondents nationwide say they have talked to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of respondents said they had spoken to their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t ‘dare to think about it,’” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
We have to start here.
Talk to your partner and your children: you can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your advisor and family to decide where and how to receive attention, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining cost.
Include your financial advisor in the conversation: It can also help you determine how to pay for these expenses.
Your financing options for your long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, an effective value-added hybrid life insurance policy that helps you cover expenses or a self-insurance with your own resources, if you have the money you need to make it.
Prepare your legal documents: cut your way into legal battles.
Look for a representative to be able to appoint a trusted person to supervise your medical care and make sure that the professionals meet your wishes in case you can not communicate.
Consider also the possibility of hiring a notary for your finances.
It is advisable to select a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid in case of incapacity.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly family member has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Specify these details in a written plan to be prepared.
Finance is not the only factor that "has to be determined, but also with which doctors you want to treat," Martin said.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have this plan ready.”
Man shot several times with a compressed air rifle at Ilfracombe
A man has received several shots from a compressed air rifle while returning home after going out at night.
The victim, about 40 years old, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials have described the shooting, which took place around 2.30 a.m. (Britain's summer time), as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His life is not in danger and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died due to a strong earthquake and tsunami that rocked the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to authorities. The death toll is expected to rise.
As the communications are cut off, the relief units have been unable to obtain information from the regency of Donggala, an area north of Palu closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people have been evacuated after the disaster.
Below are some important facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Celebes, with an estimated population of 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km of coast to the northwest of the island of Celebes.
The regency, an administrative region smaller than a province, had a population of approximately 299,200 people in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Celebes province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
The exploitation of nickel mines is also important in the province, but it is mainly concentrated in Morowali, on the coast of the other end of Celebes.
Palu and Donggala have suffered several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996 there was also a tsunami west of Donggala that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located in the fire belt of the Pacific and earthquakes are usually produced there with a certain frequency.
The following are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Ace province, north of Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Thousands of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that devastated the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake shook a pop-up area of the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake shook one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters that devastated dozens of villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A mild earthquake affected the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh and caused destruction and panic as the population recalled the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami occurred, but more than 100 people died because of the buildings that fell.
2018: A series of major earthquakes occurred on the Indonesian island of Lombok that killed more than 500 people, mainly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, a native of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference with a report of domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when an acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she stretched out her phone.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su detention center, where he is being held with an unsecured $500 bond, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, when he declared himself "not guilty, with certainty" when asked how he was declared, according to the chain.
Palin faces three Class A fouls, meaning he could go to jail for up to a year and have to pay a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B offense, which can be punished with a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently in the hands of the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, interference with the report of a domestic violence crime, and possession of a weapon in a drunken state in connection with the incident.
Her husband said he had slapped her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups for associating her son's violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people have died
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake shook the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are not working and the death toll is expected to rise over the next few days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Celebes Central, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media with the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors call for an exceptional death penalty for a suspect in the New York terror attack
New York federal prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people: an extraordinary sentence that has not been applied to the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental truck to carry out an attack on a West Side Highway bike lane in Lower Manhattan and hit pedestrians and cyclists during his journey in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and that he "intentionally" caused serious personal injury, according to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the southern New York district.
Both crimes could amount to a death sentence, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury attacked Saipov with a 22-fault indictment that included eight counts of murder for the benefit of organized crime, which federal prosecutors often use in mafia cases, in addition to a crime of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
Prosecutors said the attack required "considerable planning and premeditation" and described Saipov's manner of acting as "inhumane, cruel and depraved".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevich Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," according to the statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York brought a death penalty case to trial.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was executed in a New York federal case was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage actions for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show repentance in the days and months following the attack.
Police said they told investigators that they felt good about what they had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
According to the police, he also asked for the ISIS flag to be deployed in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the charge of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty, rather than accepting a declaration of guilt and a life sentence with no possibility of freedom, will only prolong the trauma of these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize popular troops" today during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former UKIP leader has said politicians should "feel the pressure of Eurosceptics" when one of Theresa May's own MPs has suggested he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham march that the UK would already be outside the EU if Mr Farage were the Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been highlighted when pro-union conservatives have come forward in yet another protest against Brexit in La City.
The prime minister is struggling to preserve her Chequers compromise plan amid attacks by Brexit supporters, union supporters and the EU.
The allies insist they will reach an agreement with Brussels despite the negative responses and pressure Eurosceptics and the conservative party to choose between their package and chaos.
Mr Bone told Solihull's Leave Means Leave meeting that he wanted to undo Chequers' commitment.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should have been appointed a member of the House of Lords and that he should have been given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would already be out,” he said.
MP Wellingborough added: “I will defend Brexit, but we must undo the Chequers commitment.”
To clarify his opposition to the EU, he added: "We did not fight world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and want to stay is totally false."
Conservative Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns also attended the march and told reporters: “I’m just telling you, Prime Minister, to listen to the people.”
“Chequers’ commitment is unpopular with the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is unpopular within our party and our activists, who are the people who go out on the streets and get us to win an election.
“Abandon Chequers’ commitment and start listening.”
In a message to Mrs. May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said politicians at the rally must feel the pressure if they want to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“This, now, is a matter of trust between us (the people) and our political class,” he said.
“They are trying to betray Brexit and today we are here to tell them that we will not allow them to do so.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the political class, about to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.”
“We are mobilising the popular troops of this country who gave us the victory with Brexit and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, supporters of the union marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists waved banners over the Conservatives against Brexit after the group's launch this weekend.
The Conservative member of the House of Lords Lord Adonis laughed at the Conservatives for the security problems they suffered with an application of the party at the beginning of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us they can have the necessary IT systems and all the technology for the Canada Plus deal, for the frictionless border, for free borderless trade in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no option for a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to examine the possibility of running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will examine the possibility of running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that on Saturday, the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at an open meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for reelection in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who served as deputy president of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
He has been the center of speculation about the possibility of relieving Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with constituents in the open meeting format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it’s time for “women to go to Washington to fix our government that doesn’t work, and that includes a woman in the dome.”
A man has been arrested for the shooting death of Sims, LSU
Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department has announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at the ET press conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for collaboration to identify the man in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims got a shot in the head that eventually killed him,” police officer Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and received a shot from Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to having been on the scene, in possession of a gun, and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Baton County Police Department.
Sims, a 2m junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games with 10 starts during the last season and had an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas was ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes' team orders would play an important role in the race.
From pole position, Bottas had a good start and almost exhausted Hamilton while defending his position on the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his partner.
Vettel went into pits earlier and let Hamilton run with the traffic to the back of the pack, which should have been decisive.
Later, Mercedes had to stop in pits and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton advanced after some wheel-to-wheel action that caused the Ferrari driver to abandon the free interior with the risk of staying out after a double move to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the last row of the grid and at the end of the first lap he was in seventh position on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then continued in good position for much of the race, as he kept his wheels to save time, advancing to Kimi Raikkonen and moving on to fourth position.
He eventually entered the pits on lap 44, but was unable to increase the pace for the next eight laps and Raikkonen placed fourth.
It’s a tough day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and he was a real gentleman who was told to let me go.
The team has done a fantastic job to have a u-two," Hamilton said.
His body language was terrible.
President Donald Trump laughed at Sen. Dianne Feinstein at a Saturday rally to insist she didn’t leak Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a rally in West Virginia, the president did not speak directly about Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate demonstrated that people are “bad, cruel and liars.”
“One thing that could happen and the most beautiful thing that’s been going on in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see angry, bad, cruel, and lying people,” he said.
“When you look at the reports and the leaks and they say, ‘No, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... Did you filter the document? "Hey, what?
Oh, no, no.
I didn't filter it."
Hey, wait a minute.
We filtered... No, we didn't filter it," he added as he imitated the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing Ford's statements against Kavanaugh in July and leaked it in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s statements, I didn’t leak her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“He asked me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential, just as he asked me to.”
But his denial did not please the President, who commented at Saturday night's rally: "You know what? His body language was terrible.
Maybe he didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court candidate, accused of inappropriate sexual conduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using the statements for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by the necessary means.
You see the evil, the cruelty, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over in order to have power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars repaired Friday's loss to the Elite against the Belfast Giants, as they won the game back 5 to 3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants immediately gained a two-goal advantage thanks to the overs of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie raised their team's level, but then Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised the Dundees. Then, two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured his victory.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had just won the Dundee 2–1 in Belfast on Friday.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams and the Giants had won the previous three games.
The first goal came from Dwyer's hand in the fourth minute, at 3:35, of an assist from Kendall McFaull. Four minutes later, with the assistance of David Rutherford, Beauvillier would double his lead.
During this hectic initial period, Sullivan placed the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the equalizer at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead in the first break when he scored the second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The local team regrouped and, again, Bouchard contributed to their level with a powerful goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time during the game at the end of the second half and secured their team's victory with the fifth goal near the end of the game.
The Giants, who have already lost four of their last five games, are at home in Milton Keynes and have their next game on Friday.
An Air Controller Dies To Save Hundreds Of Passengers From A Plane In An Earthquake
An air traffic controller from Indonesia has become a hero after he died to make sure a plane with hundreds of passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many have disappeared after a large earthquake shook the island of Celebes on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Many replicas are being produced in the area and there are many people trapped among the ruins in the city of Palu.
But despite his comrades escaping to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his seat at the trembling control tower at Palu Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
It remained in place to ensure that flight Batik 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take the flight safely.
He then exited the air traffic control tower when he thought it was sinking.
He died later in the hospital.
A representative for Air Navigation, Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia's ABC News.
We prepared a Balikpapan helicopter in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“It broke my heart,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, while the disaster mitigation agency has reported that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies under the rubble and many still have not been able to access them," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
The waves, with a height of up to six meters, have devastated Palu, who will hold a common funeral on Sunday.
The armed forces and some commercial aircraft are carrying aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute, an ambulance carries corpses.
Drinking water is scarce.
All the minimarkets have been looted.”
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working against the clock to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could still get worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the armed forces: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia suffered another earthquake this year in Lombok, where more than 550 people died.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after the accident in the lagoon
The airline operating a flight that is about to crash into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says a man has disappeared, although it previously said the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, they had not found a passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find him.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional details about the passenger, such as their age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said there were still six passengers in the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in good condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events are still unknown.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy claimed that the plane was anchored in the gap because the runway was short.
Some witnesses believe that the plane crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes explained that the plane was going very low.
“That was extremely positive,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers managed to walk with water around their waists until the plane's emergency exits, which were sinking.
He said the flight attendants panicked and started screaming, and that he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to upgrade a dock also helped in the rescue with an inflatable boat to transport the people affected to the ground before the plane sank about 30 meters into the water.
Aviation Safety Network data indicates that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline accidents, but Air Niugini was not involved in any of those accidents.
An analyst composes a chronology of the night that burned alive a woman
The prosecution concluded the case on Saturday in the review of the trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Justice Department analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the mobile phone records to build the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from different mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers the night he died, contradicting his earlier statements, The Clarion Ledger reports.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford denied it and testified that he was not in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he claimed he was in Sanford’s van that night, Sanford said he had lied because his van was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
The phone records indicated that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense plans to begin its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to pass into the hands of the jury on the same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio fills their music with positive messages to challenge the negative vision of the genre.
Bristol's The High Breed says hip-hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social issues.
They want to get back to their roots and put conscious hip-hop back into fashion.
Some artists, such as The Fugees and Common, have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK at the hands of artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
NY manager asks couple to say goodbye after 'racist' message
A nurse in New York City has denounced a couple for a discriminatory dismissal after receiving a misdirected text message from the mother where she was protesting because she was "another black person."
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit to an “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay at the fact that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, was black when she got to work the first day in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOO ANOTHER BLACK PERSON," Ms. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
After realizing her piffle, an "uncomfortable" Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, alleging that the babysitter she had fired, who was African-American, had done her job badly and that she was expecting a Filipino person, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid the equivalent of her working day and then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice demands compensation from the couple for the dismissal and demands compensation of approximately $350 a day for the six-month-old job for which she was hired, although there was no contract.
“I want to show them that you can’t do things like that,” he told the Post on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have responded to statements that they are racist by claiming that Maurice's dismissal was the most reasonable, as they were afraid they would not be able to trust her after she was offended.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t want to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you’ve been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
A baby?
Come on.
Plasco, who has compared the lawsuit to an “extortion,” said his wife had two months left to have a baby and that she was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to pursue something like that?
It’s not a very kind attitude,” the investor banker added.
The legal case has not yet been resolved and the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social networks and to condemn their behavior and their logic.
Paddington editors feared readers would not identify with a talking bone, according to a new letter.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in someone's shoes for the first time before it's published.
It’s very funny, now that we know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
He explained that his father, who had worked as a camera for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small fluffy bone, was optimistic about the rejection of the book. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "sweet", after his death last year.
He describes Paddington as a very important member of his family and says that his father was very proud of him, of the success he had finally achieved.
“He was a discreet man; he wasn’t a presumptuous one,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was pretty much like when your son gets something: you’re proud, even if it’s not your thing.
I think that's what Paddington's success was.
Although it was his creation and his imagination, he always used to recognize Paddington's own merit.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye over the phone.
On landing, they rushed their daughter to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called frequently to say that it was very serious and that they did not expect him to get over it," Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad and he told me he was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, beautiful.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll go with you.
The drugs they had given her to keep her body beating were being consumed and coming out of her system.
He had died before he was supposed to, and that's how it all went down.
I just had to sit and wait, because I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by family and more people.
I had to keep up the good forms.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the rest of the passengers, distracted by the experience that was going on.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
"He had his head up and the tears didn't stop falling.
It is difficult to explain, but during the flight I felt a feeling of sympathy for Nad overwhelming.
The feeling that needed my love and my understanding.
I know I loved her very much.”
Women with money cards to prevent suicides on a bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide are working to prevent others from doing so.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been hanging cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that citizens can call for assistance.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when she began suffering from depression and, at the age of 18, she was killed.
“I don’t want any father or mother to feel what I have to feel every day,” he said.
Ms Davis, 45, based in Lydney, said her son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile could light up any room.”
However, he quit his job before dying because he was in a "very dark spot."
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found him after he had taken his own life.
Ms Davis said: "I am continuously concerned that there is a side effect."
Ms Davis created the cards "so that people know that there are people they can turn to, who can listen to, even if it's a friend.
Don’t be silent, you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner for 15 years, shortly after the death of Mark's mother.
“He never said he wasn’t feeling well or that he was depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed a change of attitude.
He touched the bottom on Christmas Day, when the kids opened their presents and he didn’t look them in the eye or anything.”
He said that his death was a great trauma for them, but that they had to work it out: "It opens a hole in the family.
It destroys us.
But we have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
"I thought if we could get something like what he was asking for (an investigation with a limited scope and time), we could get some unity," Mr. Flake said Saturday. He also added that he feared the committee would be destroyed with the stalemate of the supporters.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
His reluctance has to do with the moment.
There are only five weeks left for the November 6 midterm elections. If, as expected, Republicans do not get good results, they will be weakened in getting the man they want elected to come to the country's main court.
George W. Bush has been picking up the phone to call the senators and pressure them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who has worked in the White House for Mr. Bush. He also met his wife Ashley through Mr. Bush, as she was his personal secretary.
What will happen after the FBI creates your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to dismiss the impeachment and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors from North Korea "causes" with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said 1,127 desertions occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said strict border controls between North Korea and China and the rise in prices charged by human traffickers had been the main factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Usually, the vast majority of North Korean defectors are offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul sources say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most escape through China, which has a longer border with North Korea and is easier to create than the demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers migrant deserters illegal, rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved considerably in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks focused on the stalled negotiations on denuclearization.
This came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in general terms to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, blamed U.S. sanctions on the lack of progress since then.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and in these circumstances, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysterical" and not fit to work in the High Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Superior Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh is a "hysterical" and that her temperament is incapable of working in the High Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival held in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if a woman had acted in this way, she would have been told she was ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said in relation to her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh, excited, denied the allegations of having sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes yelling and running out of words as he talked about his family and his years in high school.
He also explicitly condemned the committee’s Democrats and said the accusations against him amounted to a “grotesque and coordinated murder of a character” organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he could not work in the High Court, as it showed his prejudices against the Democrats.
“I think he has disqualified himself with these statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi showed reluctance when asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's election, if it is confirmed, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
"That's what I can say: if you don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, you're not only not capable of being in the High Court, but you're not capable of being in the court where you are now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh currently serves as a judge in the District Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she was concerned about the decisions Kavanaugh could make against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, he evaded questions about whether he would annul certain decisions of the High Court.
"It is not the time for a hysterical and prejudiced person to enter the Court and expect us to find it wonderful," Pelosi said.
Women need to exercise their power.
It’s a justified diatribe: months and years of abundant fury and you can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's uncommon. How about you?"
She went on to say, “A woman who was an executive helped me a lot somewhere who told me she was also crying when she was angry, but who developed a tactic that consisted of, when she was angry and started crying, saying to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then it continued.
It looked brilliant to me.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because, basically, they are misinterpreted.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my first jobs in an office with a male majority, where once I ended up crying with an indescribable rage, is that of an older woman (a cold directive that had always terrified me a little) who grabbed me from the kettle and dragged me to my eye.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” he said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad, because they’ll have you.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart as a presidential candidate.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was discovered on an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, very frustrated, thought there was no reason not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” he told me as he laughed 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone said, "White and the Seven Dwarfs."
As he arrived late in the campaign, he was lagging behind with fundraising, so he promised he would not enter the race if he did not raise $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
He found that some of his supporters, who gave $1,000 to the men, were only willing to give $250 to her.
“Do you think I have a discount?” she asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not start a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had helped her, frustration with the system for the difficulty of raising money and orienting herself to voters, rather than doing it to delegates, and anger, and sexism to be felt.)
“You might have thought I had a nervous breakdown,” Ms. Schroeder recalled of the press reaction.
“You might have thought my corporate sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking: What will they put in my grave?
"Was she going to cry?"
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The initial salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were heartbreaking, and while the war does not appear to end soon, a rift between the countries may prove beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year when he imposed taxes on China's main exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week, with new tariffs affecting products worth USD 200 billion. These tariffs impose a tax on half of all goods arriving in the U.S. from China.
Beijing has countered each time in the same way and has recently raised tariffs from five to ten percent for $60 billion of American goods.
China has committed to replicating the U.S. and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will fall behind anytime soon.
Getting Washington to back down means giving in to some demands, but bowing publicly to the US would be too shameful for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressures of the trade war with the US could benefit China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would trigger a fall in any of these countries is far more dangerous than witnesses had predicted,” said Abigail Grace, an Asia-based research associate at the Center for New American Security, an expert committee.
Syria 'prepared' for return of refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, devastated by a more than seven-year war.
In front of the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“Currently, the situation on the street is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas that the terrorists destroyed to restore normalcy.
All the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who had to abandon due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their maintenance are met.
The EU estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There are also six million people living in the country and in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime is grateful for any help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from the countries that financed the insurgency.
The European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. national team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, just outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has already lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
The European team again won the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's reached the 14.5 points needed to win the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who fought for most of the tournament, shot the water outlet into the hole par 3 16 which yielded the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone in all his series and became one of four players to have achieved 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was eliminated with a 5&4 by the less qualified player of the European team Thorbjorn Olesen, from Denmark.
The world's most qualified player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the biggest winner the tournament has ever had, with 25.5 career points.
“I can’t stop crying, but I can’t stop crying today.
It has been a very tough year.
Thank you, Thomas, for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, I'm so glad I got the cup back.
The team is the most important ... and I’m happy to have been able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the relief to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in an individual competition on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have won Tiger Woods, I grew up following him," Rahm, 23, said in a statement.
Woods lost all four games he had in France and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the best players ever, with 14 major titles won and just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. national team struggled throughout the weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-profile golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's frustrating performance: "I'm proud of these players, they've fought.
This morning there was a moment when we pressured the European team.
We've fought.
I take my hat off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
The 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, we will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we will make progress.
“I love these 12 players and I’m proud to have been their captain.
You have to take off your hat.
They have defeated us.”
