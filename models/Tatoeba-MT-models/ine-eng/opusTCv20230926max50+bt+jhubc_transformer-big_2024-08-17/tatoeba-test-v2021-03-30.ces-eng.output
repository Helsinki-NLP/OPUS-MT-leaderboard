I didn't see that.
Tom and Mary were dirty.
They're playing around the house.
I don't know why I'm still bothering.
I'm not as powerful as I used to be.
Tom's dog bit off a few chickens.
Don't forget that Tom is blind.
Mary seemed to be in debt.
No fuss against the taste.
When Tom returned home in the evening, he found that there was no dinner left for him.
He knows them.
I'm sure they're very proud of their daughter.
Tom turned to the right and Mary went to the other side.
There's one left.
He began to explain what had happened.
Tom's got a cast-iron stomach, he can eat almost anything.
The mother did not know what to do with her son.
He knows the wines.
Tom could feel someone patting him on the shoulder.
Do you know who the parents are?
No words can express how amazing you are.
I'd like some fruit juice.
Will it rain tomorrow?
The wedge font invented by Sumera was used in many languages in the ancient Middle East.
I love summer, but I can't stand the heat.
Of course it is!
Mary loves you.
What will you have?
What does TATOEBA mean?
Where have you been all afternoon?
You found a nice guy.
He did it out of jealousy.
She washed her dirty hands before eating.
I haven't talked to anyone about it.
Don't get too used to it.
I'm thinking about taking a few days off.
Tom never speaks to me in French.
Tom left a tall prop on the table.
It's not over a glass of beer after all day's work.
She doesn't know any of us.
So far, I am satisfied with my work.
Do you really need help?
To be you, I'll ask him.
Let them be for us.
Here's a map.
Come on, let's get out of here.
I didn't go to that meeting even though I was invited.
Hey, are you still here?
I thought you were dating Tom.
I have to get to the next station.
That dream was a mystery to me.
I'm sure you've paid a lot for it.
Tom's obviously lying.
So straight and then right and then?
I need you tomorrow.
Why don't I have food in the fridge?
It was just an accident.
I'm gonna have to call you back.
Tom says he'd like to win.
Tom's gonna be 13 tomorrow.
Cut the meat into thin slices.
I can't watch him ruin his life.
Do everything with balance.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
Yes, you must.
We went to the top of Mount Fuji.
Me and my wife want to go to Boston with you.
Do you remember what she was like?
The belt's too tight for me.
Playing the bassoon is not easy.
She took the job just to please her husband.
Moscow is the capital of Russia.
Buy as much as you want.
Tom hesitated to mention the subject.
We drink a lot of beer.
Would you send Tom to my office, please?
I bought it for Tom.
You shouldn't be selfish.
Old habits are dying out fast these days.
Tom still has a lot of work to do.
You'd better leave now.
Tom is childless.
I like to read.
We cut the rope.
I don't like interrupting you, I just came to apologize.
Tom won't help us tomorrow.
Tom stopped crying.
The train had to stop because there was a fallen tree on the tracks.
What was Tom shouting at the crowd?
He is the ideal husband for me.
She's not as beautiful as her older sister.
I brought you lunch today.
We're going to a party in 17th-century costumes.
Are you happy with your body?
Can I talk to Tom?
I used to admire Tom.
With great effort, he climbed a tree.
It is very difficult to translate Czech text.
Tom is probably the only one who knows the truth.
Tom stood too.
We all know that, Tom.
I'm glad you brought it to my attention.
I skipped breakfast.
You lied to me.
It's a beautiful language.
I won't be home for a week.
Who sent you there?
We complained to the manager about the noise in the next room.
You're a kind person.
Can you ask Mary to ask Alice?
His skill qualifies him for the job.
Crooks are falling.
She was alone in the dark.
Tom did not hesitate to tell Mary the truth.
Open your eyes.
I know Tom's wife.
Do you have a pen?
They're not helping.
I like that tie.
We didn't behave as well as we would have liked.
Please close the door when you leave.
I'll be back tonight.
Did you have a fight with Joana?
You don't owe me anything.
You scared me.
The girls I met today were students.
The sky is covered with black clouds.
I need it more than you do.
You bought a car.
I'm afraid I'll stay here forever.
Tom gave himself an enema.
What should I do in this situation?
Do you go to school by train?
Tom won't be at school today.
I'm angry at Tom.
Who will Tom visit?
It's Tom, not Mary.
Why don't you ask me out for a drink?
Why doesn't Tom want to answer Mary's questions?
Is she married?
Tom wanted to know where Mary was and what she was doing.
I can't answer that question.
I'm not sure what Tom bought.
There's another question.
I won't be surprised if that happens.
He's free.
That's not what people normally say.
Ask your mother.
Tom washed his feet carefully.
Did you have breakfast this morning?
Jana was happy as a flea when she got a recording contract.
I wish you'd come with us.
He spends a lot of time at his computer.
We wouldn't be in this mess if you were to help us.
I don't know what to do anymore.
He's going to visit his uncle.
They're all out.
Tom couldn't hear it, but Mary did.
I can give you an autograph if you want.
I saw him three years ago.
How could anyone live in a place like this?
It's been raining for two days.
I know exactly what's going on.
Have you ever sung in French?
I'm used to this cold weather.
The Americans surprised the Germans.
There are not enough chairs in the conference room.

Tom doesn't like to work.
My heart is French, but my ass is international.
If you have a problem, I want to know what it is.
Tom grabbed Mary's hand.
I'm perfectly happy on my own.
You did what you had to do.
We need to understand that we are still learning.
Tell Tom I won't be there.
Tom played with Mary Tennis yesterday.
What's your dad's name?
There was a half-destroyed wall.
I spoke to him in English and found I could make a deal.
Tom had to run.
I see a book.
Did any of you ever talk to Tom?
You should apologize.
The fence is freshly painted.
She knows who you are.
I want you to see her.
Well, you'll regret it.
You're getting fat.
We're supposed to win.
All answers must be written according to the instructions.
Answer me the questions.
Everyone would be happy if Tom left and didn't come back.
Did you bring the book?
I don't dare open my mouth.
Their father is Czech and their mother is from Hungary.
I'm thinking about getting a divorce.
I bought a bag.
Do you know where your father came from?
What are you?
Did you do it on purpose?
There was absolutely no doubt.
This letter is personal, and I don't want anyone else reading it.
As far as I know, he's not married.
I can't say anything wrong about Tom.
Stand over there and you'll see better.
He's old enough to stand on his own feet.
As soon as we saw what Tom was wearing, we got a burst of laughter.
Tom's wrong, isn't he?
It's better to be dead than red.
They agreed to postpone the wedding.
If I were you, I'd go home.
It would be great if you could do it for me.
Tom knows what he wants to say.
The wedding took place last week.
I'm still eating.
The horse is barking.
I borrowed Tom's comb.
I'm boring.
I'm writing my will.
I'm not that stick anymore.

If it doesn't rain tomorrow, we'll go to the tower.
Try talking to the police.

Do you like strawberries?
She used to be bigger.
I assume he's gone home.

I made a terrible decision.
I'd rather go back inside.
She doesn't have to.
I know she's pretty.
I don't go to school on Sundays.
He has his own house.
I don't usually do that in the evening.
Why do you want me to ask them for help if we can handle it ourselves?
I expected them to tell the truth.
Wrap it under the mat.
I'm so glad you're here.
She's sloppy.
Tom didn't want to lose Mary.
Tom's home.
Throw the ball to Tom.
I'm insulting her.
Was the police involved in this?
We like children.
I wish I was a better man.
You're stealing, right?
Tom has to get involved.
You should consult a lawyer in advance.
You're a good journalist.
That's what Tom's used to.
I love this book.
The waste is clogged again.
When I got home from work, I found out that someone had stolen our apartment.
Read the book.
