Munich 1856: Four maps that change your view of the city
A madhouse where young people are supposed to meet today.
A burial chapel, where is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.
Small-scale gardeners farm the former land of farmers.
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories.
It's annoying when maps aren't up to date.
Anyone who has ever had to get upset because the car-navi instead of a bypass road showed a green meadow.
The historical maps of the digital Bavaria Atlas, an offer of the state government’s Bavaria geoportal, are anything but up-to-date – but that’s precisely why they are very informative.
Especially when you compare them with current online maps.
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the distribution area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern Atlas is a patchwork carpet that is not recognized as such.
More detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, have been incorporated into the large overview map for cities and municipalities.
According to the Bavarian Surveying Authority, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and were the result of the first survey of Bavaria.
Her client: Napoleon.
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the Peace of Lunéville of February 9, 1801: it was the present-day neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria.
Elector Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian Surveying Administration.
The Urpositionsblatt for M<0xC3><0xBC>nchen dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bayerische Landesbibliothek.
The comparison between the past and the present is most impressive with the example of the state capital.
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is Untersendling, which still appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.
Sendling was incorporated as a district of Munich 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877.
Today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.
The houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, which was not named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser until 1878, a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: hand-numbered floor pieces from the so-called "recording", from which the property tax was derived.
Small plots no longer prove farmers there - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sonne".
A large green area is distinguished north of Untersendling.
The Theresienwiese, since 1810 the venue of the Oktoberfest, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.
On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.
In the Urpositionsblatt you can read in the area of today's Au-Haidhausen district not only the street name "am Gasteig" or from the height "Auf der L<0xC3><0xBC>ften" - but also in capital letters "Irren Anstalt".
Yes, here on Auerfeldstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, people with delusions were once locked up.
There, in 1858/59, the Munich-Irrenanstalt "Auf der Auer L<0xC3><0xBC>ften" was created.
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chaining of so-called fools.
In addition, he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, which has been involved in an exhibition with the institution.
For 280 patients there was room at first, later it was expanded to 500 places.
At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient – the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Klinikum M<0xC3><0xBC>nchen-Ost, one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany, has been located there.
In the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in the Salesianum in Munich.
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.
West is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east is residential buildings from the 1980s.
In 2015, the children's house "Casa Don Bosco" was built - in architectural style, following the original construction of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed in World War II by bomb attacks.
Marienplatz was listed as "Haupt Platz" around 1856, the Kaufingerstra<0xC3><0x9F>e was called "Kaufinger Gasse".
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.
In December 1944, the bombs of the Allies ripped many holes in the city center.
A large one remained to this day - at the Marienhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a medieval crypt chapel once stood at the Marienhof, where these days the preliminary work and on April 5, 2017 the kick-off for the second S-Bahn trunk line took place.
With the slider, you can compare the old Munich map with today's aerial view - and fill the hole at Marienhof.
Civil Rights Group Releases Travel Warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri due to the state’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri, which is due to come into force by August 28, 2017, calls on African-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to and exercise extreme caution when traveling through the state, as a number of questionable, racially based incidents are occurring across the state recently," the statement said.
A recently passed Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the state’s law enforcement agencies, which disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to issue the travel warning, the NAACP said.
“They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.
They’re being stopped because of their skin color, they’re being crushed or killed,” said Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
“We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven’t heard yet.”
It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.
The group cited incidents such as racist offenses against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in questionable circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas during his trip through the state and was taken into custody by Missouri police without being charged with a crime.
The council also points to a recently published report by the Missouri Attorney General’s Office showing that black motorists are stopped 75 percent more often than whites in the state.
“The recommendation is for people to be aware and inform their families, friends and co-workers about what could happen in Missouri,” Chapel said.
“People need to be willing to bring bail or let relatives know they’re traveling through the state.”
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI’s hate crime reporting program, ranking the state 16th in terms of the number of such violations.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination.
Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after states passed immigration laws obliging local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations, which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Weed fence project is elementary
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.
CDU MPs Peter Wei<0xC3><0x9F> and Kordula Kovac got a picture on the spot.
Representatives of the Fischerbach CDU-Lotsverband met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MPs at the Schwendemann family’s Rechtgrabenhof.
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, feeds 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and hosts holiday guests in five apartments.
The "Black Forest milk" is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann.
On the table of the holiday guests comes exclusively regional.
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the pasture fence project as "elementary important".
I can't make a profit on such steep areas.
The green area provides a lot of work, much needs to be processed with the Motorsense.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," Schwendemann stressed.
In 2003, he took over the parent company and operates it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if he does not run a bio-farm.
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear: "The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy about the leader promotion".
At a cost of 3,000 to 4,000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.
It is hoped that this will allow the reforestation of the land to continue for a long time.
“The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they can continue their operations,” he said.
Farmers are often criticized for their support.
In 2013, a total of 25 parcels of eleven participants were fenced through the pasture fence promotion.
The open area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be forested until at least 2023.
Of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half was funded through Leader, a quarter was borne by the municipality of Fischerbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence.
"The big advantage is the longevity of the fences," Schwendemann explained.
Kordula Kovac stressed: "You are doing a really good job, without farmers and rural women it is not possible".
Peter Wei<0xC3><0x9F> also stated: "Here the best food is produced".
The Landschaftspflegerichtlinie (LPR) Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg enables the state to promote pasture fences.
The goal is to keep the Black Forest open.
Prerequisite is the presence of a conveyor belt designated by the LPR.
In addition, the area to be fenced must not be towed (affinity above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by deforestation.
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018, the application is currently underway from eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build almost 16 kilometers of fence.
The open area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros.
Is nothing more sacred?
Trump’s White House is Now Taking the Statue of Liberty
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking the statues.
Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with CNN’s Jim Acosta over the president’s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration to the Statue of Liberty.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue himself.
A horde of boat owners and Liberty impersonators would have lynched him if he had.
But he attacked its meaning, and in particular the meaning attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.
As Miller Acosta quipped, “I don’t want to dwell here on a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem to which you refer, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."
Miller is factually correct, but as he put it himself, it’s not really about history.
It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "Your tired, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who long to breathe freely, / those wretched wastes."
There has never been a time when the “wretched waste” was better seen on our screens.
Miller did not engage in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump’s US.
This conflict over the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural controversy: it is in fact a conflict over the importance of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who were committed to putting their words at the base after her death - knew very well that they were carrying out a high-policy act.
The sculpture was intended to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical pictorial representation.
Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.
And she gives herself a very different name: Mother of the exiles.
The poem’s connection to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it back for a long time.
Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neocon, bringing the American flame to the underworld: “Lady Liberty is moving forward.
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch should not light the way to the United States."
Quite unusually, Limbaugh came across something here.
The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.
It’s really about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they need to hear.
And, of course, that’s not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.
Their torches are not meant to light the way, but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of UK team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Great Britain
The UK’s athletics performance director, Neil Black, says the 16-man Scottish contingent in the World Championship squad will “make a massive contribution to the team.”
A record number of Scottish athletes were selected for London 2017, which starts on Friday.
Black believes that "something special is being developed in Scotland" and that the athletics of the United Kingdom need to learn something from it.
“We welcome it, and we’re trying to understand it, and we’ll continue to do so until we find out,” Black said.
“I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they’ve done.
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.
British athletics: It has something to do with what they have done.
And also with the guy on the street corner.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it’s absolutely brilliant.”
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart – who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected team captain.
"Eilidh is quite modest.
Their captain’s speech was incredible,” Black says.
“A number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in naturally was great."
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in her fifth World Championships at the 400m hurdles, says it’s “unbelievable” that 16 Scots are on the British team.
Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championships so far was seven, which were achieved in 1983 and 2015.
Middle-distance runner Muir leads the way and has set five British and two European records last year.
She will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m races.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 metres, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season that included victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "enormously proud" of the fact that many of her countrymen not only belong to the team, but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals.
“The special thing about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my teammates voted for me and elected me makes it something very special for me,” she added.
"Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who are part of the team.
It just shows how far we've come.
And they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to get on the podium.
What about my speech as captain?
Yeah, I think she was fine.
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Cup.
So it’s really important to bet on this home support and benefit from being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it’s just going to be such a great atmosphere out there.”
Blocking critics via Facebook: Don’t apply for a public office if you can’t stand heating up voters
The father of our country knew something about bad press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn’t take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
He sneered at the criticism, of course.
But he has not silenced his critics.
For in 1783 Washington said, “Freedom of speech can be taken away—and, stupidly and silently, we are led to slaughter like the sheep.”
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s employees have blocked and deleted the posts of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a backlash with "Well, what?"
“It’s just Facebook,” a lot of people said.
But it's important.
And it's especially important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular.
He has the second-highest approval of the nation’s 50 governors.
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.
He was also very skilled at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playing his hairless head to debut chemotherapy on his side.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor’s side – which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees with public tax dollars – is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman Amelia Chase defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people waving the whip online.
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only real people who talk to their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, not a troll.
They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan’s Catholic faith.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked about hate crimes.
“I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news,” she wrote in the comments section of The Post.
"I don't appreciate this idea either, if a number of people take a stand on the same issue, then some are more likely to disregard it as a so-called collective effort and not be recognized as a large group of concerned citizens."
What the governor’s employees called a “concentrated spam attack,” others would probably call “advocacy.”
The Facebook era makes it easy to crop a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing that employees were sent out to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence protesters.
But that is exactly what is happening digitally.
Hogan isn’t the first public official to be criticized for flouting Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this issue fell last week in Virginia.
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.
And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the affordable port had a similar effect as the Internet.
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter writers beat his leadership.
And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.
People who used pseudonyms such as "Juricola", "Valerius", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.
Petitions that criticized his position on the Amity Treaty, trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington Project’s online papers.
But he didn't silence her.
Freedom of speech, dissent, and discourse are at the heart of our nation.
And true leadership means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at Renaissance Club
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for home comfort over the next three days as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The Nordire, who led the Archerfield Links to the final round last year before losing to Paul Eales, is linked to the new venue and serves as tournament ambassador on behalf of club founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi.
"I've seen how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how it achieves its fame with this event," Rafferty said.
"Players will see this course from its best side, it is in great condition.
Jerry did a great job fixing this place.
He is an ardent supporter of this game and is proud of his performance here.
This is a great showcase for this course."
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
“It really feels special,” said the Southport-based player.
“I couldn’t defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.
Getting back to this part of the world is magical.
It is a wonderful place to play golf.
The memories from last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year.
It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.”
Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday, returns to action on home soil.
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
“It always means a bit more when you play at home,” said Orr, the man from Helensburgh.
“You want to do well, but you also feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoyed playing again, and I played a solid golf.
I’m happy with how it has gone so far.”
With the trio on the field are former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots on the field, the others being Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.

Less lung cancer deaths from secondhand smoke
In the past two decades, fewer and fewer people have died from passive smoking due to lung cancer.
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.
"We estimate that 167 lung cancer deaths per year are due to second-hand smoke," said study leader Heiko Becher.
As a comparison, he drew his own study on this topic from 1994.
At that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany.
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.
Home connections turn out to be very complex
The construction works on Villinger Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e are in full swing and "are somewhat in time", according to the head of the construction yard Fred Heinze.
In the area of the house connections, the situation was more complicated than expected, since there was a lot of hiding in the underground, which was not mentioned in the plans.
Traffic, which repeatedly hampers the construction work, is a big problem for the construction team of the company Stumpp.
"The ignorance of drivers in front of red traffic lights and barrier grilles is already enormous," reports Heinze.
The road was closed and only the buses were allowed to pass through.
Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks.
“The hot days have been pretty exhausting.
But fortunately we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt,” says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's Goldland
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn’t use a stove.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regency in the restless Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally referred to as a "note" - directly into the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred tuber is removed and swallowed with eager, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also does her daily work, for example, washing clothes with cloudy water from the nearby swamp.
A bucket in a roofless room serves as a latrine.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she was not assigned any fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: most villagers are unemployed, and many drink heavily, and there are soldiers here.
“No one dares to walk around the village after 5pm,” she says.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was admitted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders were supposed to vote in front of the occupation troops by a public hand survey.
An existing movement, which revolted for independence against Dutch rule, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers from it.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is desolate. The trip includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive by rental car.
There is no public transport.
The city of about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, and corrugated roofs that have been converted into various yellow-brown tones by rust.
Very few Indonesians have made their journey here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners.
Before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
There were other changes as well.
“We weren’t used to wearing these clothes,” Degei says, pointing to her lively, hand-woven turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
"In the past, we only had leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia’s goldland.
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a New Jersey-sized highland province with 153,000 residents.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $78 billion.
However, these riches are a source of misery for Papua, ensuring that Indonesia’s powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.
A 2005 New York Times investigation reported that Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 to a single officer.
Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are treated mercilessly.
According to activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969.
Mass killings in Papua’s tribal highlands in the 1970s became genocide, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission.
In the region alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters last year.
“We will lose everything,” says a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, which includes reports of atrocities last year, such as unlawful executions and torture – rape and electric shocks are particularly popular, according to another report – and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
“It’s difficult to count the number of victims as incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher for Human Rights Watch.
The screws have been tightened as Papua’s resources bring in inflows of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but the demographic development is changing as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese warung rabbits sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetable served with peanut sauce.
Local people are fighting to stay here.
“Migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua,” said Abeth You, a 24-year-old Paniai native who moved to the provincial capital Jayapura to work.
“It has cost the native Papua – the Mama-Mama [the women] of Papua – their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, promised to address the inequalities and legal violations in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The former carpenter secured 27 of Papua’s 29 districts – including Paniai – on his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.
But in Papua, little has changed, and today the locals feel cheated.
“Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored,” You says.
In fact, Paniai suffered a low point only two months after Jokowi’s inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas carols in front of a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on their headlights.
One of the soldiers took offense at her tone and later returned with four soldiers, according to local pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had been drinking chased and beat the group with their rifle pistons, victims and witnesses said.
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.
A child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was hit so hard that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escalated the next day.
About 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a soccer field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and performed the Waita dance—running in a circle and imitating a bird song—of Papua’s Mee Pago tribe.
Some protesters began to throw stones at police and military posts.
When the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent a command via an internal radio: "If the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead," says an official document from TIME, which was not released to the local media.
Yeremias Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali, saw the menacing danger and called for calm and urged the crowd to return home.
No one was in the mood to listen.
“When I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist,” he told TIME on the porch of his colorfully painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired, but says the bullet came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here.
"It was overcrowded, many shots were fired," he added.
The local man Alfius Youw was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shootings.
"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, bears only one name, TIME in a gloomy mood.
"I saw that he was dead... I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papuan police, Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers only wanted to "secure" their station because it was being attacked.
“We need to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” Papuan police spokesman Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
“It’s about life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killings came to Jakarta only the next day 'filtered'.
For three weeks, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the historical grievances in Papua.
"I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future," he said.
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he would set up an out-of-court mechanism to address historic human rights violations.
But the excuses started almost immediately.
“Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The point is that we have committed to addressing these violations, but there are processes that need to go through,” he said.
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5, saying he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, “everything is regulated by law,” he said.
Wiranto, who has been charged by the UN with “crimes against humanity” that claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor’s bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been solved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with ferocious disbelief.
“I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there’s been no progress,” Yohanes says.
"I'm tired."
He says he still lives in fear years later.
“I’m scared,” he says.
“I’m afraid of being arrested by the military, I’m afraid of being shot.”
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that the people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident.
He says he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
“After I buried the bodies, the military was looking for me,” he says.
The shootings did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in Paniai’s Deiyai neighborhood.
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to bring an unconscious man to the hospital, one person died and 17 others were injured, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company’s location office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at officers who responded by firing warning shots at them.
But locals say the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) started shooting at the crowd and killed one.
“We were so panicked, we’re afraid there will be revenge,” says 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly admitted here, according to TIME.
"I hid in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament has called for accountability of the officers involved and for the mobile brigade of the police to be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a hotbed of unrest for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribesmen Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua.
Many joined the “Free Papua Movement” (OPM), the rebel army that claims to defend Papua’s rights by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in recent years under the pretext of "ensuring national sovereignty".
Some never show up again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as “a tragic, forgotten place”.
Poverty strengthens the discontent.
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is also out of reach.
The people here grow everything they eat: especially nuts and fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the task of women, who can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes each.
They keep most of the harvest for the family, while the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten pieces of note cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have grown between the native Papuans and the new migrants who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better-educated and wealthier migrants.
Papuans rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to run their own businesses competitively.
“The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here,” says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua.
In addition, restrictions on reporting to international media remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions, despite being given rare permission to film.
According to Phelim Kine, Human Rights Watch’s deputy Asia director, Jokowi’s campaign promises to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized.
"There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia's troubled easternmost provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a blacklist," he said in a statement.
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to Papua’s immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific states – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands – called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
The same countries have historically supported the OPM.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir dismissed the group's accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta: "In Indonesia, a democratic system still exists, and there is free media, so it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases."
The people on the ground want more foreign governments to take notice of this.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals broke their silence and urged him “We want freedom,” according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
“Jokowi is a person who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shootings,” said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people, apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai people, like other Papuans, see their voice for Jokowi as a "guilt" that he has to repay.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai gun victims carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: the body of a victim was buried on a site opposite the police and military station.
They know that justice may never come to them, but at least they won’t let those responsible forget their crimes.
“A member of our family was killed,” Yacobus says with his head down.
"What else can we do?"
Fire engulfs Dubai's 'Torch' skyscraper for the second time
A fire broke through one of the world’s tallest residential towers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337-metre-high, 79-story building.
It is the second fire to sweep through the high-rise building in just two years, which is accidentally called the Torch Tower.
The building was evacuated, no injuries were reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the fire.
“We slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the people’s screams.
We ran down the stairs, and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor," a resident who gave his name as George told Reuters.
Dubai’s civil protection authorities said firefighting units extinguished the fire at around 4 a.m. local time (00.00 a.m. GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it is working to provide housing for those affected.
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the cladding, exterior cladding, or insulation.
In the UK, police said they believe the system of slabs for insulation and cladding at London’s Grenfell Tower in June may have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire that killed around 80 people.
No Davis Cup reform: Continued Best-of-five
The president of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) has crashed with his big Davis Cup cup at the General Assembly.
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City, the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup singles only on two winning bets was not supported by the required two-thirds majority.
Although often very long, but also very much appreciated for this reason, the five-sentence classics remain the traditional competition.
63.54% of member countries voted in favour of the reform, so ITF President David Haggerty’s goal was only narrowly missed.
“We respect this decision, but are disappointed that our member nations have not adopted the full reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic competitions,” Haggerty said.
We will continue to work to improve the competition.
After many objections to the vote, it had already been suggested that the final should be held in a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: so the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup in the following year will have the right to host in the first round.
In order to reduce costs for the organizers, the requirements in terms of training places, etc., will be facilitated and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup.
More than 1 in 5 U.S. Travelers Bring Prohibited Items to Plane, Survey Finds
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20 percent knowingly or unknowingly smuggled prohibited items past U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who boarded the plane while carrying inadvertently prohibited knives or other items with blades.
Less than 1 percent said they had discovered late that they had mistakenly traveled with firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service, Stratos Jet Charters Inc. - also found that younger travelers were more likely to disobey the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.
The most common items that were deliberately smuggled past TSA agents were food and liquids.
More than 3 percent admitted knowingly carrying items with blades through security checks, while 2.2 percent of female respondents and 3.7 percent of male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought prohibited drugs into the plane.
The company said it surveyed travelers across the country to find out how many inadvertently smuggled goods through airport security and how many did so on purpose.
It’s no surprise that the people most likely to carry smuggled goods – knowingly or unknowingly – through security were the ones who flew the most.
However, the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing.
People are often unsure which fluids to take or how much of them.
So it’s no surprise that most of the items seized by the TSA are prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA might look at books as smuggled goods.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
Elon Musk doesn’t care: Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order
Elon Musk likes to announce with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3".
So far, he has denied that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk has revealed for the first time a different, less shiny number when announcing the recent quarterly balance sheet: those of the cancellations of the new mass market model 3.
Musk had often in the past few months advertised with the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery is just beginning.
Now Musk admits: Of the total 518,000 pre-orders, 63,000 have already been withdrawn.
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations.
In the event of a cancellation, Tesla will pay back the 1000 Euro (in the US 1000 USD and in the UK 1000 Pounds) "reservation deposit" in full.
Currently, there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations, Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts.
However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of about 12 percent of all orders could become a problem so far.
His argument: The challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not the demand, but the production side.
Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.
In 2018, it should be - all models combined - 500,000, in 2020 one million.
The demand for this is obviously there.
According to Musk, there are currently 1,800 reservations per day.
If you order a Model 3 today, you can expect delivery in the second half of 2018 at the earliest - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines, never tested in practice, without major interruptions with maximum utilization.
Many experts doubt that this is possible.
But if there are longer delays, then the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.
Because then the company can not prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves.
EPA chief Pruitt withdraws due to delay in Obama-era rules to reduce emissions
One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama-era rules to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants.
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.
He did not mention the suit that had been brought against his previous position in a federal appeals court.
It is a deadline that expired on October 1 for states to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid “interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth.”
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma’s attorney general before being appointed by President Donald Trump, has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil fuel industry oppose.
Wednesday’s sudden reversal is the latest legal setback for Pruitt’s regulatory rollback agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a Obama administration rule that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that his reversal of ozone standards would simply reinforce the EPA’s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others, and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation," said Pruitt, who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job.
“We don’t believe in regulation through court proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously the law and the authority that it gives us."
However, the EPA’s statement said that Pruitt would at some point use his “delay authority and all other legally available powers” to ensure that the regulations are “based on sound policy and the best information available.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive recast of the ozone rules.
A bill passed last month is expected to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who headed the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group intends to maintain legal pressure.
“The EPA’s reversal — according to our lawsuits — is an important benefit to the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that is pouring into their communities,” Schneiderman said.
In this case, New York joined California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia.
Ground ozone occurs when pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people, and contribute to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered over Pruitt’s surprising change of course.
“It’s worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the person in charge of protecting the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological crusade to offer ourselves to environmental polluters and their special interests."
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church
750 years of St. Hilarius Church: On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, a serenade will be invited to the old cemetery area in Tumlingen on Sunday, 16 July, at 4.30 p.m.
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.
Visitors to the sixth Benefit Serenity can be enchanted by this powerful venue.
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town has made the friends and supporters of Tumlingen their concern.
Walter Martini emphasizes: "It is a unique village gem".
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg Register of Documents: Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen together with the guardianship" to Magister Eberhard von Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 marks of silver.
According to the text of the document, in addition to the former parish church, there was also a sovereign court, to which the church or the patronage right belonged and not vice versa.
There were people living there too.
As can be seen from the description of the Upper Town of Freudenstadt from 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the locality of Tumlingen, was the "mountain" of the third, the dominant settlement core of the village.
Old maps from around the year 1600 support these historical facts.
The patronage law arose from the early medieval eigenkirche law.
A lord who built, equipped and occupied a church with a priest continued to own this church and could also inherit this church of his own.
This included the right to appoint a pastor or to propose a new pastor to the bishop.
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.
The larger of the two decays at Christmas 1673.
The newly acquired bell first sounded in 1692, but had to be turned off later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the Thirty Years' War (1616-1648) the window panes were smashed and the bell ropes were stolen.
The roof was leaking.
In 1796, French troops camped near the church.
They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.
Remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.
Until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last resting place for the dead from H<0xC3><0xB6>rschweiler.
In 1823, the cemetery was expanded and the Hilarius Church was demolished.
Only the church tower was left standing.
On New Year’s Eve in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half of it collapsed.
To prevent an accident, the tower was demolished.
Only the towering dwarf that still exists today has survived as a witness to the 750-year-old church history.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem of the "Schaffigen Retirees" are the successors of Dieter Dockhorn to the Hilarius plant.
As organizers, the friends and supporters of Tumlingen invite you on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade at the old cemetery to St. Hilariuskapelle.
It is designed by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with word contributions by Kurt K<0xC3><0xBC>bler and Reinhold Matteis.
Mayor Hartmut Romann speaks the final word.
The programme starts at 4.30 p.m.
Admission is from 15.30.
At the end of the Serenade, a drink takes place in front of the cemetery.
"Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest", the organizers will highlight the fantastic view.
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.
The organizers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is important for tumlingen and H<0xC3><0xB6>rschweiler.
The friends and supporters of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care, as confirmed by Serenade organizer Walter Martini.
Association wants to have approval of wind turbines checked
"Boisheim defends itself" sees no legal prerequisite for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat.
The association "Boisheim is defending itself" has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette.
It was done unlawfully.
The association argues that at the time of the approval on December 30, 2016, no wind turbines could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette, since at the time in Viersen only on the city border to Schwalmtal there was a wind power concentration zone.
Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible, but at the same time the concentration zone excludes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city area.
Such zones are intended to prevent a "sprinkling" of the landscape.
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette by a change of land use plan a few days earlier - but this had not been approved by the district government of D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf, due to a design error.
"Due to the lack of a planning legal requirement, the approval decision issued is still unlawful and therefore also to be withdrawn," said Christoph Erkens, chairman of "Boisheim Retaliates".
Current state of affairs: Before the summer break, the city council has once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette; an approval of the district government is still pending.
Erkens: "The granting of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is thus excluded under planning law at this point".
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation.
"The corresponding letters have been received since last week at the district of Viersen," a spokesman said.
The circle takes them as an occasion to re-examine the matter.
However, they are unlikely to stop the process.
With regard to ongoing proceedings before the administrative court, the district did not want to comment on Thursday on the content of the argument of the association "Boisheim resists".
NEW Re, a subsidiary of NEW, plans to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area on the Boisheimer Nette.
Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.
With the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity demand of around 11,400 households will be covered - which corresponds to about one-fifth of the electricity demand of all four households.
NEW Re wants to invest around 20 million euros.
Last summer, Viersen City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen as well as a stake in a wind turbine in <0xC3><0x9C>bach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg.
Car and Tractor Crash: Woman Dies in Terrible Accident
A terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at about 10 a.m. on the L 333 between Niederwallmenach and Bogel (Rhein-Lahn-Kreis).
A woman was fatally injured.
Two other people were slightly injured.
The state road was closed for hours.
According to police reports, a 17-year-old woman from Bornich with her car, accompanied by her 53-year-old mother, drove the L 333 in the direction of Bogel.
City and retailers plan "home-shopping" weekend
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are to discover new shopping opportunities in the city centre in September.
The trade association and the city administration want to use the weekend of 8 and 9 September to attract residents to the shopping mall in the city center.
As the chairman of the trade association, Christian K<0xC3><0xB6>nig, announced, the "home-shop" weekend is intended to sensitize customers about what offers the own city provides away from the usual supermarket goods.
A market with regional suppliers is planned, similar to the weekly market.
In addition, local companies should present themselves with their training places.
In addition, the shops of the city center are supposed to invite you to the "Midnight-Shopping".
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the surrounding region.
In preparation are commercials on the radio, an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend, according to Christian K<0xC3><0xB6>nig.
The city administration and the trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Thus, the trade association and the city go to another stage of the project "Attractive city center".
This includes new offers such as the first "active day" at the fountain festival, as well as a sales-open Sunday, talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept.
In addition, customer potential is to be unlocked again or again.
This includes spa guests and tourists.
But also many locals would have lost sight of the city center when shopping.
In the end, everyone would have to contribute to revitalizing the city center - up to landlords, the businesses of the whole city and clubs.
It was true to overcome with a network the lethargy, which had spread in part, King had said in the spring.
Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in M<0xC3><0xBC>hlhausen, said that five cities in Thuringia will participate in the third nationwide "home shopping" day.
In addition to Bad Langensalza, these are Weimar, S<0xC3><0xB6>mmerda, Heiligenstadt and Bleicherrode.
The day should "promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance for the common good of our cities," said Streich.
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can influence his or her own direct environment with his or her purchasing behavior.
Two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
During construction work, there was a gas explosion in the school building.
New people were injured.
In a gas explosion in the US city of Minneapolis, two people were killed and nine others were injured, some of them severe.
According to the fire department, another injured person was in critical condition on Wednesday (local time).
A man died when part of a school building collapsed in the explosion.
A missing person was later also rescued.
The dead were school employees.
As an accident, the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline.
During the holiday season, only a few people stayed in the Minnehaha Academy building.
Trump pressured Mexico over border wall payment after leaked transcripts of phone calls
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post.
On January 27, Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. president insulted him for publicly denouncing the wall, reportedly saying to him, "You can't tell the press that."
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the United States, and vowed to let Mexico pay for the project.
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released, revealing a tense exchange.
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia to take over is “ridiculous,” “miserable” and “stupid,” and that the existence of the trade brokered by the Obama administration would make him look like a “depp” after he had proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the U.S.
Mr. Trump ended the call after saying to Mr. Turnbull, “this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day.”
Moore's Ford Massacre: Activists Resume Racist Lynching as Call for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe, Georgia, and bumped into Moore's Ford Bridge.
Before the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, could reach the bridge, a group of white men emerged with guns to block its way.
The leader of the mob—a middle-aged man in a needle stripe suit—took a long pull on his cigar and peered through the windshield.
Inside, the inmates floated in fear.
"We want this n---r Roger!" shouted the man.
“Get him out of the car!”
Screams tore the silence as a young black man was pulled from the passenger seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which was played on July 22nd, is just a replay.
But then when a sling is thrown around the neck of "Roger", almost all very real sighs in the audience are ejected.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to emulate the night two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with the murders.
“It’s really inconceivable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years — even though we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are,” said Tyrone Brooks, who helps organize the reenactment.
"It's a dirt stain on a story, but it's a burden on our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
For him, resetting serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
“We want prosecution, we want ending, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we need to get justice,” he said.
“We cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice.”
A medical examiner places a sheet over the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynching on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch trial.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects have been on the loose for decades, civil rights activists say the double motivation for Lynch’s actions across the city has always been known: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Supreme Court allowed black citizens in Georgia to cast their votes for the first time during the pre-election campaign in the summer.
At about the same time as the election, according to the FBI, black farm tenant Roger Malcolm stabbed a white landowner, Barnett Hester, during a fight — allegedly because of a woman.
Brooks said the rumor in town was that Hester had slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband.
On July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a prominent white landowner, paid $600 to free Malcolm from prison, according to the FBI.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they moved away from the prison and approached Moore’s Ford Bridge, a lynching mob surrounded the car.
"As it turns out, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders," an FBI report concludes.
"It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local law enforcement that was not only involved in the murders, eliminated evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses."
Brooks puts it even more succinctly.
“It was a suffrage massacre,” he said.
“They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community: ‘If you register and if you vote, this will happen to you here.’
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has led the annual follow-up to the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder.
Their portrayal is vivid, poignant, and is grounded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to watch, and even harder to look away, but Greene said that’s the point.
“We don’t want to talk about the lynching because then we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us,” she said.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t want to listen to me or don’t want to hear what I’ve been through.”
The rehearsals for this year’s production began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors—a dozen whites and the rest blacks—come into a room and listened when Greene launched a well-rehearsed overview of the play.
Wade Marbaugh is Greene's co-director.
He has played the role of chief clan member for years, but he said the role will never be easier.
“I feel dirty because I’m not,” Marbaugh said.
“But I think it’s very important to keep this story alive because we don’t want to go back to those times.”
On the other side of the room, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, sampled their lines.
The play begins with Malcolm, who yells at Hester and urges him, angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, n--he, get off my property!"
Rascona responds to the fire.
There's a break.
And then everyone (at least all black actors) bursts out laughing.
Green laughs the loudest.
"What?" asked Rascona.
He is alarmed and confused.
Was I too hard?
"No," said Greene, still chuckling.
"I just don't think white people said 'n--' at the time."
"Yes," one of the other black actors joked.
"You just have to hit the hard 'R.'."
And that’s where the energy in the room shifts, a sense of camaraderie replaces the discomfort.
Everyone is busy getting this right, not only because of the game, but also because of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona says the N-word, he says it sharply and emphatically.
No one laughs at all.
This repetition ends violently and quickly.
There are screams, shots and then silence.
A woman, dressed in a mourning dress, stands over the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holidays' mournful praise "Strange Fruit".
Her voice breaks with every second word.
About a hundred meters behind, a group of about four dozen spectators wipes sweat and tears from their eyes.
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white.
A couple has arrived from Ithaca, New York, to see the performance, many just come down the street.
They’ve all experienced Georgia’s oppressive humidity for nearly eight hours when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Malcolms and Dorseys.
To this point, the murders have remained an anecdote, but now, standing on the same land where the Lynch murders took place, the air feels ghostly.
When the last notes of the song expire, Greene invites the crowd to get closer and inspect the body name.
Children squat on their heads, register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper to each other.
"You're not really dead," murmurs a little boy, as if he wanted to remember.
After a few minutes, Greene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it's over.
The actors throw away the lynching rope and wipe away their tears.
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the clan member.
Nick Rascona embraces two of his fellow players and then breaks down crying in their arms, the emotional burden of the performance finally breaking through with him.
"It's okay," whispers one of the women.
“We know it’s not in your heart.
You did it for a reason.”
Later, the audience gathers with the actors for dinner.
At a table, a white couple from Atlanta is excited about resetting with a black couple they have just met.
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that made the performance feel good.
“It’s hard to hear these horrible words and deeds... coming from people who look like you and do that because they look like you,” she said.
“What this really does to me makes me believe that the lynching is still going on,” she added, “today it’s just called police shooting.”
In the same room, Tyrone holds Brooks' farm at his table, he eats and remembers the civil rights.
He said he had already started planning the performance next year.
“The set-up is inspiring in a way because it describes the horror of what we’ve endured, but it’s also a moment of learning,” he said.
“It’s like if we don’t learn anything from it, then it can happen again.
He who does not study his own history, who does not know his own history, is condemned to repeat it."
"God's Dawn" reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner’s monumental work, director Frank Castorf relies on a colourful frivolous staging in front of a gigantic, six-story backdrop.
The stage (designed by Aleksandar Denic) shows a shabby street corner including the Wall and D<0xC3><0xB6>nerbude in Berlin, a "plaster and elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.
In front of it is an open Mercedes oldtimer, in which the Rhine daughters pose as rocker girls, or alternatively an isetta.
Stacked oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf's leitmotif - money, power and greed - which draws through his "ring" staging.
The three Rhine daughters - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize wonderfully as already in the "Rheingold".
Kess seduces Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), rips a corpse into the trunk in a Hollywood manner and gives the Krawallo clique.
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully ugly hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.
Brutal the scene when he kills Siegfried.
Later, Gunther (Markus Eiche) has to believe in it.
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.
Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski are celebrated in a stormy manner, who humbles himself and bends his hands to form Merkel’s red.
There is great applause for the festival orchestra, which shows up on stage for the first time - in the face of the great heat again in casual casual clothes.
The performance of Frank Castorf and his directing team was eagerly awaited.
If he had to have a valid pipe concert in 2013, five years later there was a great jubilation, in which the occasional "buh" calls went down.
The head of the festival, Katharina Wagner, may have been happy about it.
“You notice that the audience has grown up with the ‘ring’ in some way,” she had said shortly before the DPA performance.
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf, but it also grew an understanding of his point of view.
I draw a positive summary.
Max Menge works as a volunteer
They work in several locations during their volunteer year.
Where everywhere?
Quantity: Usually in Steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I help out here in Greven in the furniture bridge.
I also worked full-time at the school.
How are your experiences with it?
Quantity: It is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I deal with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You are now 26 years old, so a late-career volunteer.
How's that coming?
Q: I did my high school graduation.
And then a civil engineering degree, let's say, successfully terminated.
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else, work with people.
And then I wondered what you were doing.
Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it really is on site, in focus maybe also.
And was it so?
Quantity: I have collected great impressions.
In the winter semester I will start my studies in social services.
I will study dually, probably do a social worker training at the Jugendamt Herne and study in Hamm at the Fachhochschule.
Is it not unusual to have several different locations during volunteer service?
Quantity: Yes, it is very variable.
I guess it always depends on where you make your FSJ.
You can do it from retirement to youth work - in all possible facets of social work.
With me it was very varied.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.
For me, that was exactly what irritated me.
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really goes.
Other than a civil engineering degree?
Quantity: Of course, this is not about calculating statics.
You always have other people in front of your head who have a completely different story behind them.
Whether a refugee or a teenager who has been taken out of the family - you always have to deal with it individually.
Very interesting.
And you had no fear of touch?
Q: I'm not the type for that.
It is an area that gives you a lot.
Lots of love, lots of kindness.
Sometimes there are negative moments, but that’s the way life is.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revive the business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent as another restructuring program was launched to overcome the pressure the company was facing.
The job cuts, which chief executive John Fallon announced mainly for late 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to his previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 jobs.
In May, Pearson announced a <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) cost reduction plan in a third cost-cutting program to reinvigorate a business hit by the fast-paced move to digital learning.
The company, which sold its stake in Penguin Random House to partner Bertelsmann last month, said the outlook for the fiscal year remained unchanged after seeing a 1 percent increase to <0xC2><0xA3>2.05 billion in the first half of the year.
Kabul convoy attack: NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others, officials say.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, a NATO statement said.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in the incident in the Qarabagh district.
The bombing is the latest act of violence to hit Afghanistan this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
A NATO statement said the explosion occurred on Thursday night when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "person-carried improvised explosive device".
The statement says that all the injured are in a stable condition and are being treated at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents say the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, a suicide car bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive bombing in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the country’s deadliest militant attack since U.S.-led troops ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the precarious security situation in Afghanistan as U.S. President Donald Trump weighs in on increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting the country’s military and police.
Correspondents say the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies and in particular in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA reverses decision to delay Smog rule after lawsuits
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to delay a regulation by the Obama administration that requires states to curb smog-causing emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
The EPA announced late Wednesday the decision to push forward the so-called “Ozone Regulations 2015” and said it showed the agency’s commitment to work with states.
"We believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners," EPA chief Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt had announced the EPA’s intention to delay ozone regulations – which are designed to measure pollutant emissions in a part of the country to determine where incisions need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards – by a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday, saying the effort was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration has sought to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump said would boost economic growth.
However, the efforts have triggered the backlash of Democrats and conservation groups who are concerned about the public health impacts of higher emissions.
The EPA’s website says inhaling air that contains ozone “can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms” such as asthma.
City Council wants a common space
In the end, the decision was clear: with two votes against, the municipal council of Fluorn-Vinzeln decides to set up a common space in the future senior housing complex.
Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the missing part of the property is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden.
Although it will still take until the area belonging to the church community is in the possession of the municipality, there is no longer a planning obstacle for the project to be voted on by a private investor.
For this there is a discussion on a common space.
One of the two investors still in the boat offered to meet the community.
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with at least 70 square meters of space for a special price.
The administration and the majority of the municipal council intend to provide such a common space as a meeting place not only for the residents of the senior housing, but openly into the municipality.
As an example, the word from the "knit cafe" made the rounds.
The decision, which was already decided last autumn by the provision of funds for the current budget, is being sweetened by funding possibilities.
The building is located in the rehabilitation area.
The establishment of a common area, Tjaden reports, would be eligible with 60 per cent of 30 per cent.
The proposal for a decision provides for a signal to the investor that in this regard he does not want to throw any knots between his legs, the finding that both saddle - which is based on the environment - as well as the countertop - which reduces the height of the beam and makes the construction more economical - would be possible.
Needless to say, Wilfried Sohmer is not the only one who thinks this addition is necessary.
If it helps: unanimously, it passes the body.
It is not so easy in the common area.
Daniela Ruf refers to the many own buildings with which you do not get so far ahead, but now you lean out of the window at the common room, she says: "I'm hard at it".
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the common area - but absolutely against municipal participation.
It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to either wealthy or even foreign investors.
This is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area you do not give a subsidy, but get a real, marketable equivalent value in case of doubt, is the opposite.
Staiger's request to split the motion for a resolution accordingly finds three supporters.
For example, two votes against the original programme, which Stefan Haller summarises as follows: "If we take the decision in this way, we are taking a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure".
Collision with car: cyclists thrown on road
When crossing the road, an 82-year-old cyclist on Wednesday in Garath was caught by a car and seriously injured.
As the police reported, the 82-year-old Langenfelder had been coming from Hilden on his bicycle at 12.20 am on the cycle path of the Schwarzer Weg road.
The senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buchholzer Busch.
A car driver driving in the same direction gave him priority.
When the Langenfelder went to the road, he apparently did not pay attention to the counter traffic.
He collided with a car that was driven by a 66-year-old Hildener.
The man was thrown into the street.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to a hospital with a ambulance.
FC Bayern M<0xC3><0xBC>nchen must give up David Alaba and Thiago at the Supercup against Borussia Dortmund
The Super Cup takes place without him: David Alaba has to let the game against Dortmund suck.
With staff concerns, FC Bayern is travelling to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season.
Seven professionals are missing the defending champion in the Supercup against the cup winner.
The personal worries of the German football record champion Bayern Munich will be greater before the Supercup on Saturday (20.30 a.m./ZDF and Eurosport) with cup winner Borussia Dortmund.
Coach Carlo Ancelotti has to do without David Alaba in the duel with the BVB.
This was confirmed by the Italian on Friday.
Also missing are Manuel Neuer, James, Thiago, Jerome Boateng, Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat.
For the five defeats in the past six Test matches, Ancelotti has blamed the physical condition and lack of balance in his team’s game.
“We know we’re not in the best physical condition,” Ancelotti said, adding: “The most important point is the balance in the team.
Last time was not good."
However, the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory game of the season.
“Football is also tactics, strategy, personality and motivation.
I have great confidence that my team will show these qualities.
The crew is ready.
We want to play intelligently,” said Ancelotti, who expects a “difficult, intense game.”
The duel between the two German football heavyweights draws the fans in their banter.
The game is sold out with 81,360 spectators, the German Football League (DFL) announced on Friday.
Walk in the Resin from Star to Star
In the resin, the first "star path" is to be created nationwide.
This is planned by the association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There is a planetary path in G<0xC3><0xB6>ttingen - since 2003.
A "star path" meets the information needs of many resin visitors, it was said.
It combines nature, science, movement and athletic performance.
The members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and constellations.
In a first phase until 2018, the association plans "well-reachable installations in five to six locations" in the Upper Harz.
St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegei<0xC3><0x9F> and Sieber were in question.
The information on the tables should be supplemented via the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network reception plays a role in the location selection.
Freedom of movement is also a criterion.
Later, the star path will be extended train by train.
"On the star path, the viewers learn a lot of interesting things, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the association explained.
In addition, they learned why stars had different colors or why one star shone brighter than another, even though it was much farther away.
It will also tell you which constellation a selected star is in and when it is best to see it.
The association has been operating the highest-ranking observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg since 2014.
The site in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany, according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation.
From there, the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy can often be seen with the naked eye.
In the University City since 2003 on the initiative of the Planetarium G<0xC3><0xB6>ttingen funding association, there is something similar to the planned Sternenwerg - the Planetary Way.
Starting in front of Gebhard's hotel in Goetheallee, which forms the interior of our solar system, the planetary path with its steles leads up to Hainberg and the observatory - as well as an "extraterrestrial" location in Diemarden (community of the same) with the planet Sedna.
The steles with the individual planets — including the dwarf planet-degraded Pluto at the endpoint — are positioned exactly at a scale of one to two billion.
The Earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter, while the sun, exactly 75 meters away, at least 70 centimeters.
The entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers.
While the light from the sun to Pluto takes about eight hours, pedestrians need a good hour to stare at Pluto.
Pedestrians are faster than light in space.
The march to the next fixed star, however, would take another six months.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, discuss a possible showdown
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who were supposed to be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds, met for the first time on Thursday.
They were in separate rooms at ESPN offices in Los Angeles, until Garcia, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion, walked down the hall to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization super featherweight champion.
After Garcia's victory by unanimous decision over former four-division world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both fighters are members of the top five pound-for-pound list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, "How are you, Champion?
I wish you good luck."
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ESPN.
When the couple posed for photos, Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the "perfect order of magnitude".
"I'm a former featherweight," Garcia recalled.
“I’ve risen for Broner [to 140 pounds], but I’m not that big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to get down to light weight.
And he has to move on lightweight [135 pounds] and then we fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's give them that."
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked whether it should be on pay-per-view, part of a strategy that Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-pound debut this year, to agree next summer with Garcia a date (37-0, 30 knockouts) that also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell's Forum in September.
“This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all the fans have asked for it,” Garcia said, and later expressed himself openly fighting at the network that offers the best financial package.
We are the best.
No other name can generate this kind of attention.
Whenever you are ready...”
Garcia said he values Lomachenko as "an enormous fighter", and he may be taking part in his Saturday fight.
But Lomachenko stopped at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks the three-fight champion from Riverside looks "very slow out, I'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-off".
Garcia said the focus was on showing punch strength, then boxing.
They both said they could feel the momentum built up for their own struggle.
“This is the fight that needs to be fought.
No other fight gets so much attention and enthusiasm.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, “I’ve been waiting for the top fighters, and that’s Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
Four injured after tyre crash
Four people were seriously injured in an accident on the A7 on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information, the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at around 4.30 p.m. just before the market-wide point, presumably after a tyre spotter.
The car threw to the right into the slope, where it overturned and then remained on the roof in the green strip.
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were partially seriously injured in the accident.
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service, the A7 was blocked to the north for about an hour, then traffic on the left lane at the accident site could be bypassed.
Fortunas Hoffmann: "Three-chain works better"
Andre Hoffmann hopes, after the 2-2 start of the season against Braunschweig, that the optimization of the defence formation in Aue will bring points.
With the first game of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result also, there would not have been the two opposing goals in the 2:2 against Braunschweig.
"That was two goals too many, and we have to be even more careful in Aue," says the defender of Fortuna D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
In the Ore Mountains, the triple chain is also to be further optimized.
And a goal after a free kick, the fortunes do not want to catch themselves anymore.
"For the future, it will be so that no one stands next to Michael (Rensing) on the line."
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience in the preparation with the three-chain, his team copes better than with the four-chain.
"I still don't know how we will act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his case, "because we have players in the triple chain at the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gie<0xC3><0x9F>elmann, who can build well," Hoffmann said.
"The prerequisite is, however, that we harmonise even better and we do not make as many mistakes in the construction of the play."
Of course, Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game.
"But whether you can talk about a failed start after an indecision, I don't know.
The performance could be quite good," Hoffmann said.
"But if we can stand with four points on Sunday and focus on the cup, we will certainly be able to talk about a proper start to the season."
His coach didn’t want to know.
"I'm only judging the start of the season after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage over Aue, only because the Saxons' game in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a storm.
"Now they can pretty much start the season with a home game," Funkel said, and Hoffmann believes the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher, as they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a promotion favourite in the bone.
“But they don’t know 100 percent where they are right now,” says Fortuna’s insider.
Although the guests from the Rhineland as a light favorite on Sunday go to the meeting in the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.
"The fact that we are sweeping them away just because we have the right to be in the top six is nonsense," says Funkel, whose record against Aue from nine games is quite positive.
"There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start," explains Fortuna's head coach.
"To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant."
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday.
New Results of Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Tests Published
The latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, which were subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age, show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority (R<0xC3><0xA4>ttsmedicinalverket) started conducting the tests last year.
During the asylum process, they are supposed to make the assessment of the age more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationverket) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors.
To date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to be tested and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) were assessed as 18 or older, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was "possibly 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was “possibly under 18 years of age”.
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months.
“We don’t see a big difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are pretty constant,” he told The Local magazine.
The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed as over 18 years of age does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied about his age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests, saying there were 442 cases that “suggest that the person being examined is 18 years of age or older.”
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results, it found that in 243 of these cases, the person had openly stated that they would turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, in which X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRIs of knee joints are taken, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticized in some areas.
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see if they went through puberty sooner or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think the kind of measurement should be used.
Assessing biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can’t say it for sure, we shouldn’t act as if we could,” he told Metro newspaper.
However, G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests: “In general, you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low.
The biggest risk is when the person is just under 18, in this case this is about 10 percent."
Full in plan
Work on the three bridges of Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well.
On Wednesday, a seven-ton concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach.
"We're very good in time, it's going great," says Reinhold Leicht, construction manager at the Department of Roads and Transport at the Government Bureau Freiburg.
In April, work began simultaneously on all three bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach in need of renovation.
The construction is scheduled for October and it is easy to be sure that the schedule will be adhered to.
The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete, which is clad with red colored sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was built in 1900.
Like the other two bridges, it has now entered the years.
In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings will now be thoroughly renovated.
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach.
They are made of red sandstone.
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve, or 10.60 meters long.
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.30 meters wide and seven tons heavy so-called bridge cap.
This is an edge mount, which is also used as an operating path.
At the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday.
Then the pedestrian path should run on it.
The special thing is that these are finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps.
The laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach has required a special sense of fingertip.
Because there is also a fiber optic cable, to which many companies are connected.
The residents were informed about the project by handcuffs in advance of the work.
In addition, fish and crabs had to be fished first.
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the Sammelweiher in the direction of Schramberg, traffic is regulated by a traffic light.
The road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels "Tannenhof" and "Sieben Linden" is fully closed for construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher village entrance.
The costs for the three bridge renovations total 700,000 euros.
The whole thing is funded by the country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Banter protest at German potato salad
It is not so often that parties pull together, but when it comes to the alternative for Germany (AfD), it comes together, which is otherwise difficult to bring under one hat.
The parties represented in the Kreistag Vulkaneifel (CDU, SPD, Gr<0xC3><0xBC>ne, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag on this day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the poster "large campaign opening".
And it brings to the start well-known names - such as Alice Weidel, who together with Alexander Gauland forms the leading duo for the Bundestag election on 24 September, and the deputy Bundespresidency Beatrix von Storch.
But those who are already on site hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD students, but to demonstrate.
The motto is "The Eifel remains colorful".
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto "All at a table" on the fountain square, but now takes place in the parking lot below the Rondell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall.
A colorful picture that can be found there.
And what Christa Karoli, chairman of the forums One World and one of the leading organizers, is really pleased: "Great how many people have gathered here".
There’s music and lots of food, including an “German potato salad that the AfD could easily eat,” says the woman who brought him.
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein, it shows presence especially at the station, which is only a few meters from the venues.
How did the AfD get to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes from the AfD Vulkaneifel reports that he has worked for such an event and received the award.
The 45-year-old from G<0xC3><0xB6>nnersdorf had initially requested in Daun, but there he got a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes.
Now the Rondell, Hompes is happy that "we can have such a nice event here".
Looking at the event on Rondellvorplatz, he says: "This is the right of the people, the main thing is that it remains peaceful".
It does the same thing: Around 8 p.m., a band is set up in the Rondell for entertainment, and various speakers in the Stadthalle, including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chairman Uwe Junge.
In the hall there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election, Alice Weidel, and the deputy Bundespresidency Beatrix von Storch to give their speeches.
The police presence is unchanged, but so far the officials had a quiet evening.
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour, the guests in the forecourt have a longer breath, but cleaning up is also required shortly after 9 p.m.
The police can back off - no special occurrences.
Trumpet Hits Trumpet
A rehearsing with the Wolfach posaunist Frederic Belli is available in the Haslacher Klosterkonzerte series tomorrow, Sunday, at 8 p.m. in the Klosterkirche.
Together with the Bulgarian trumpeter Miroslav Petkov, he gives a concert under the motto "Black Sea meets Black Forest", or "Balkan folklore" meets a classical German education with roots in blues music.
Both soloists are winners and prizewinners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras.
Petkov is solo trumpeter at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is soloposaunist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra.
Both combine the desire to not only exceed the limits of their instruments, but also to merge the limits of the different genres.
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new costume, Daniel Schnyder's "Weltmusik" unites with Bulgarian folklore, and in the piece "Exchange Suite" by jazz-choice award winner Nils Wogram, classical music, jazz and free play blend together into a fascinating total work of art.
This core piece of the program was first performed this spring with great success in Freiburg.
Renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it especially for the two musicians and more: The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is consciously included in the concert.
Kristen Stewart talks about her bisexuality
“Some people love grilled cheese and will eat it for the rest of their lives.
But I want to try everything,” Kristen Stewart said openly about her bisexuality.
“Once I bite into grilled cheese, I think, ‘Oh that was cool, what’s next?’”
The Hollywood star's most well-known relationship was with her "Twilight" colleague Robert Pattinson, who eventually split up bitterly.
Despite all this, the brunette actress assures the "Harper's Bazaar" magazine: "I was seriously in love with everyone I dated.
Or do you think I would have played it?”
After her divorce, Kristen admitted that she was bisexual: "I've always lived dualism and seriously believed in it.
It has never confused or hindered me.
I just never wanted to be taken seriously.”
According to "Bang Showbiz", she suffered especially during her school days, when she preferred to dress like a boy: "Not all girls are typical girls.
That really hurt me a lot.
When I was 11, the kids told me I was going to look like a baby.
I felt really attacked, scared and ashamed.
Now I look back and think, 'Girl, be proud of yourself!'"
Especially to the public, she does not like to explain her love life: "People expect you to behave in a certain way and that annoys me.
And maybe some people call me ungrateful, but I don’t like having to justify myself to the public.”
The Governor of West Virginia has announced that he will change the party.
The Democratic governor of West Virginia, Jim Justice, announced Thursday night at a rally with President Trump that he will change the party.
Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me,” said Governor Justice.
"Today I will tell you with many prayers and much reflection... today I will tell you as a West Virginia resident, I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor."
The rally broke out in cheers.
"Tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republicans," Justice added.
“As a coach, I would say it’s time to play a different game.”
Mr. Trump previously promised a big announcement at the West Virginia Rally.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not approve of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, and inherited a coal business from his father.
It is worth about $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night, saying, "The change of party from Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would hinder us rather than work to make our country great again."
“With only 15 governorates and the control of the fewest legislative bodies in history, the announcement by Governor Justice is only the latest rejection by a party that is top to bottom unguided and unable to find a positive, consensual message,” RNC Chairman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.
Coe praises 'honest' Russian apology for doping scandal
World athletics chief Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he described as an obvious apology from Russia for a doping scandal, but he reiterated that it was not the time for the country to be reinstated into the sport.
Russia’s athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that his country’s ban on sports was correct and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he is sorry for "all the athletes who have been snatched away from gold and silver medals in competitions".
Despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted to uphold the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia.
“I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation,” IAAF President Coe told reporters.
“The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned.”
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.
“I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force’s recommendations that this is not the time to re-engage Russia,” Coe said.
"We have to do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation.
The guiding principle has always been that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupt system," he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players at the World Athletics Championships, which begin in London on Friday, according to strict IAAF criteria.
The head of the IAAF Task Force, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that Russia still has to meet some of the criteria for a reset.
Drug tests are still inadequate and banned trainers are still free to work, he told reporters in London after a lecture at the IAAF Council.
An act of mourning for soldiers who have been killed in Mali
At a funeral in Fritzlar, northern Hesse, about 1,000 people thought of the two soldiers killed in a helicopter crash in Mali.
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures.
Minister of Defence Ursula von der Leyen (CDU) said nothing about the cause of the crash.
However, she described the two pilots who died as "capable of their profession".
"We bow to this highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany," she said.
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Chief of Staff from North Hessen had died a week ago in West African Mali.
Her coffins were transferred to Germany and taken to the St. Peter's Cathedral in Fritzlar on Thursday, accompanied by a death watch of the Bundeswehr.
At lunchtime, only the family members in the church said goodbye.
After that, the funeral celebration began in the circle of the family, closest friends, of representatives of the Bundeswehr as well as of politics.
Among them were Hessen's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier (CDU) and the Inspector General of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker.
The mourners laid roses, the relatives stood arm in arm on the coffins.
In front of the church, Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas.
Defence Minister von der Leyen described the dead soldiers as "highly decorated" and experienced in use.
The Chief of Staff had built up the flight operations of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Fritzlar and had been one of the first six trained Tiger pilots of his regiment.
Volker Bauersachs, commander of the regiment to which the soldiers belong, also declared: "If this crew could not avert the crash, no one would have been able to do it."
Minister von der Leyen did not show any doubt about the UN mission in Mali: the deployment was dangerous.
But it is also of great importance “for a country from which we are separated by only two states,” she said.
After the funeral, the coffins were removed from the cathedral.
When and where they were buried, the Bundeswehr did not provide any information.
Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave next to his wife
The husband of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Prince Henrik (83), does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death.
This was reported by the Royal House on Thursday.
Traditionally, the Danish royal couple are buried in Roskilde Cathedral.
The sculptor Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn N<0xC3><0xB8>rgaard already produced a sarcophagus for the two.
The Queen agreed with her husband’s decision, the statement said.
Where Prince Henry was buried is still unclear.
However, he did not intend to be buried in his French home.
Prince Henrik had never made a dent in the fact that he was not happy with his title.
After the accession of his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would have liked to become king.
In 2016 he retired and also laid down the title "Prinzgem<0xC3><0xA4>hl".
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and the position he wanted, he does not consider himself equivalent to his wife - even after death, declared Lene Balleby, the chief spokeswoman of the Danish royal house.
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be is still unclear.
However, he does not intend to be buried in his French home, but in Denmark.
He likes the country he's worked for for the last 50 years.
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, son of a French noble family, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
He worked on the Thames in the French Embassy.
While his later wife always showed the sympathy of the people, Prince Henrik had a difficult position with the Danes in his almost 50-year reign.
In an autobiography about the first years in Denmark, Henrik said: "A few months after my arrival, everything I did was criticized.
My Danish was fluctuating, I preferred wine instead of beer, silk stockings instead of knitted socks, Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n instead of Volvo, tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gauloises, who I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had a reputation in this country to be the brand of socially critical intellectuals, I could not hope for indulgence.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed.
Those were two mistakes.”
Prime Minister Weil wants a quick re-election
CDU and FDP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
Lower Saxony's Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) is in favour of a quick re-election of the state parliament after the loss of the red-green government majority, but he does not want to resign.
Because on Friday he spoke out for the dissolution of Parliament.
Earlier, the surprise resignation of a Green MP from her parliamentary group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the official date of the parliamentary election, the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The former Green MP Elke Twesten justified her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg (W<0xC3><0xBC>mme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said in Hannover on Friday.
CDU group leader Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn Th<0xC3><0xBC>mler would like to recommend that his group include them.
Together, the CDU and the FDP have 69 seats in the Lower Saxon Landtag, the SPD and the Greens have 68 seats.
So far, the relationship has been the other way around.
The new Landtag will be regularly elected on 14 January next year.
Thumler said the red-green state government must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation.
Stephan Weil, however, considers it essential that the Landtag resolves its self-dissolution as soon as possible.
The CDU group is expected to decide on its next move on Tuesday.
The state constitution also provides for the possibility that the Landtag deprives the Prime Minister of confidence and elects a successor.
“Our Constitution offers several options.
These possibilities must be examined in a legally clean manner," Thumler said.
"You will calmly discuss all questions if they are legally reasonable."
Thumler called Twesten's move "but somewhat curious".
She said: “I’m not a traitor.
I feel very good."
She described herself as a supporter of black-green.
The Greens called on the absconding MPs to return their parliamentary mandate.
"Of course, we assume that she will return her parliamentary mandate, which she has received through the green list of countries, with immediate effect," said the country's presidents Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan K<0xC3><0xB6>rner.
Green Party leader Anja Piel said: "We regret the decision of every Tweeden in particular.
You deliberately decided not to have a debate in the group.
"Even against the background that there were no substantive differences, we cannot understand this step."
SPD chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxon Green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU as treason.
"The behaviour of the former Green MPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the voters, but also a betrayal of the Red Green," he wrote on Facebook.
He supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) to quickly re-elect the Landtag.
The exit of Twestens costs red-green in Lower Saxony the majority.
The politician, "in her hurt vanity and frustration, puts her personal interests before the good of the country," criticized SPD Secretary General Hubertus Heil.
"It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony participates in this dirty intrigue game and tries to beat political capital out of it".
Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn Th<0xC3><0xBC>mler, head of the CDU parliamentary group in Lower Saxony, wants to recommend to his MP to include every twesten in the CDU.
The SPD leader in the Bundestag, Thomas Oppermann, accused Twesten of falsifying the results of the 2013 parliamentary election with personal career thinking.
The CDU was at that time the strongest force before the SPD, but the SPD and the Greens had a thin majority of one vote in the Landtag.
Minister of Agriculture in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison ivy, Mr. Schmidt?
Germany is talking about contaminated eggs.
How could the scandal happen?
How can consumers protect themselves?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt (CSU) speaks and responds in an interview with the Editorial Network Germany (RND).
Mr. Schmidt, how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print.
On the consumer protection portal www.lebensmittelwarnung.de, the federal states collect the latest information on the affected egg charges.
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned.
Even if, according to everything we currently know, a health hazard is practically excluded.
Does Aldi now take on the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture?
Food surveillance is the responsibility of the federal states.
Nevertheless, my house has been immediately turned on and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since becoming aware of Germany’s concern.
All information and risk assessment is available to consumers.
The trade, like the manufacturers, has to ensure that the products sold are transportable and harmless to health.
If the maximum residue level of 0.005 mg/kg is exceeded in eggs, they are not transportable.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and eaten.
This time, it’s not the companies’ fault.
Are production companies and consumers in the same boat?
According to the current state of knowledge, the production plants do not face any direct guilt.
Rather, they have to reckon with economic damage due to allegedly illegal practices of service companies.
As always, there are not enough inspectors.
Is it only the staff or the final responsibility?
It was the official controls that uncovered the case.
The truth is, however, that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded.
Precisely for this reason, a consistent explanation of such events and the handover to the public prosecutors in cases where crimes may be present are crucial.
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect a full explanation from the responsible authorities.
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals?
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and transportable food.
When an unapproved insecticide is used in the food industry, consumers are rightly outraged.
Through the armored means, manufacturers, dealers and consumers have fallen into a situation that is absolutely not necessary.
In principle, it must be clear: the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the attitude of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately.
This needs to be worked on consistently and with high pressure at all levels.
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and without any gaps.
How football’s financial rules affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules, which aim to prevent unhindered spending by European football clubs, will not interfere with Neymar’s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris-Saint-Germain.
Any consequences for Paris Saint-Germain will still come from UEFA, because the leading organization that has overseen the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.
Financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid 222 million euros ($262 million) to buy the Brazilian out of his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will be several tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can certainly loosen up the money for Neymar to sign and take him to a galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding from Qatar’s energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money to acquire players, but must counter with legitimate sources of income that allow them the break-even point in their football-related business.
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that had taken on huge debts in their pursuit of success effectively cheated and risked ruining themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.
In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses.
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used at Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with potential and then investing heavily to improve the team and build a global brand – should become a tougher matter.
During the current three-year FFP investment period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And although Platini has fallen out of favor with the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor, Aleksander Ceferin, remains committed to deterring excessive spending.
“Of course FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future,” Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG has paid Neymar’s buy-out clause in one lump sum, it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the replacement amount for the next five years can be reported in the annual financial statements in the amount of 44.4 million euros.
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit PSG, along with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.
PSG received a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million (then $82 million), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million – and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014/15 Champions League remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenues through companies linked to the owners of a club.
While a Qatari company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeded standard market rates, UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come via payments from the 2022 World Cup organizing committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar have disputed that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and such a maneuver could be easy for UEFA regulators to figure out.
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
UEFA had no preliminary talks with PSG about Neymar's transfer, the people familiar with the situation said on Thursday.
They spoke on condition of anonymity to The Associated Press as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015/16 with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.
The association expects that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing.
The Spanish league was clearly annoyed to see one of the best football players go, and they tried to prevent Neymar’s departure by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.
“It is a clear case of ‘financial doping’ with the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar’s ultimate ownership of PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club owns an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga’s reservations against a state funding an association.
"It's the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years," Wenger said on Thursday.
“Once a country has an association, anything is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new shoe supplier
In recent years, Chocolat Frey has made chocolate for the Swiss.
Now the sweet cooperation is about to come to an end: the airline is re-signing the order.
Swiss spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed, at the request of the news agency sda, a corresponding report of the newspaper "Nordwestschweiz" from Friday.
According to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018.
The products would be inspected every two to three years and subjected to quality control.
"We are very pleased with the current supplier of chocolate Frey," the spokeswoman said.
Around 17 million small red and white-packed schoggi boards at 14 grams per year distribute the flight attendants to the passengers before landing.
The Swiss did not want to disclose the costs.
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to "Northwest Switzerland" at 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about one billion francs.
But more important is the advertising effect: For a schoggi manufacturer, it is a prestigious order.
How many applicants there are in the new tender, the Swiss does not want to betray.
Only Swiss manufacturers are eligible.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey wants to strive for a renewal of the contract beyond the spring of 2018.
For the sda, the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for comment.
Since 2006, Swiss has been distributing chocolate boards on board its flights.
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter, Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hug.
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the launch of the collaboration with Chocolat Frey.
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers.
On long-haul flights, First Class customers are pampered with delicacies from the Confiserie Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli, in the Business Class close passengers Schoggi of Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey.
Swiss Schoggi of Chocolat Frey also distributes chocolate on the short route, both in business and in the economy class.
Athletics - Discus Olympian Robert Harting reaches World Cup final
The three-time world champion will fight for a medal in the final on Saturday.
His brother Christoph, Olympic champion of 2016, had failed in the national World Cup draw and could only watch the discus competition from the stands.
Also with the first attempt, the Polish defending champion Piotr Malachowski, who threw 65.13 meters, qualified for the final fight.
Nostalgia goes into the niche in "Wet Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
This repetition of the story is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90s grunge era (when the leading thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter filmed the sketch comedy "The State" for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Poe, Paul Banks, and Michael Showalter.
As a cultural artifact, it is both a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-enabled era of permanent memories.
But as a franchise, it feels like time is short.
"First Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of its absurd humor (it contained an original story for a talking can of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
By sticking to the core of the gag - middle-aged actors playing horny kids growing up - they still created the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later", with its adults now playing adults, is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more according to the casting can principle, including a riff on the Stalker films of the 90s such as "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle".
At one point, a character stumbles through an Apple Powerbook, some inline skates, and "a number of other things from 1991."
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovable Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a novelist, still hasn’t forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has still not lost his virginity.
And there’s another crazy-evil plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter), now backed by George H. W. Bush (a good impression by Michael Ian Black).
As always, the excursions are the best part of the franchise.
It’s especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillon’s “Singles” underarm, whose former big-man-on-camp Andy now feels like an old cracker.
It’s the moments of random insanity that could heat this franchise up like a sort of repetitive “Seven Up!” series until it reaches what I take to be its logical conclusion: “Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later,” whose final scene will show the band as they make the movie premiere of “Wet Hot.”
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War from "The Americans", the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its East-against-West ring fight iconography.
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.
The main roles - a hard-fought Gregor and an idealistic Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's not much more than an idea.
There are some nice gags to watch (the police spend time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chlo<0xC3><0xAB> Sevigny - ensures a decent game 'Find the voice out'.
But “Comrade Detective” is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama — a killer wearing a Reagan mask gets involved — that it often plays like one.
In six long episodes, it pulls, and the comedy is not fast enough or frequent enough.
"Comrade Detective", which has been edited to a shorter length, could better deliver its agitprop satire, as Gregor and Iosef repeatedly visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two fat men who devour a bunch of hamburgers.
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a feast.
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong: we even do it with our own recent history and with theirs.
Fight against the drug mafia in the country
The police managed to strike the Italian mafia in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
On Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Baar-Kreis, Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, as the prosecutor’s office informed Konstanz on Friday.
Fifteen defendants between the ages of 25 and 77 have been arrested and warrants have already been issued against them.
In addition, the officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested during simultaneous raids in Italy.
German arrest warrants were issued against the two Italian suspects.
The two are likely to be shipped to Germany.
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.
In total, more than 300 police officers were deployed.
Members of the Mafia are accused of organized drug crime, serious acts of violence, attempted murder, and robbery and extortion.
Since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor’s office has been investigating Konstanz against organised drug trafficking in the southern German region.
There was a lively exchange between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.
Therefore, the large deployment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo.
The aim of the investigations was mainly Italian nationals with close reference to the Italian mafia.
An incident on May 27 in H<0xC3><0xBC>fingen, in which several shots were fired at a restaurant in the early morning, is also likely to go to the account of the gang.
Wisely complains about large gaps in the register of foreigners
"Data of citizens who should not appear there": According to a report, the register of foreigners in Germany has significant shortcomings.
This leads to some serious wrong decisions in asylum procedures.
According to a media report, Frank-J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Weise, the Federal Government’s refugee management commissioner, has drawn attention to large gaps in the central register of foreigners.
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to "partially serious wrong decisions" in asylum procedures and deportations, he warned in an analysis available to the "S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutsche Zeitung".
According to the register, there are ten million people with foreign citizenship, including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries.
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained, the data quality in parts had not been good so far.
In individual cases, data from 1921 were found, "of people who have long since died, or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register."
"Failed data entry can significantly slow down return processes," the report said.
In addition, the statistics on people obliged to leave the EU included citizens who did not have to leave at all.
Such misallocations, however, led to “a distorted debate about the treatment of those who had to leave,” according to the analysis.
Meanwhile, the federal government has apparently begun sending refugee families with children under the age of 16 back to Italy once they have arrived.
This comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "Neue Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung".
According to the document, BAMF is conducting such procedures "concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and toddlers - to return to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, this has been virtually impossible, the newspaper said, referring to the difficult situation on the ground.
Under the Dublin Agreement, it is responsible for refugees from the EU state they first reach.
If a migrant continues to travel to another EU country, this state can send him back to the country of entry.
For its reasons, the Office now writes: "In the meantime, the reception capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly".
Italy has given guarantees for the admission and accommodation of families.
Even the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) considers these commitments to be sufficient.
Other EU states would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement.
Ulla Jelpke, the spokesperson for the left-wing faction in the Bundestag, criticised this decision: "Families with children are at risk due to the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of human rights admission conditions and a threat to the child's well-being".
Second best result achieved
A total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach, the blood donation service already made available to other people.
At least by the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday.
First of all, J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Greule, who shared 50 liters of blood with his 100 donations.
Traditionally, the community in the meeting of the municipal council recognizes the multiple willingness to donate blood.
"It's great how our body is designed for this and we pay the donors' respect, who provide their blood for strangers, even unselfishly," said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood donation helps several people," explained Holger Maisenbacher, the head of the German Red Cross (DRK), because the canned food is broken down into its components.
Three people could benefit from a blood donation.
At the same time, Maisenbacher reported on the actions that will be carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring.
"This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors," said the DRK circuit readiness leader.
Obviously, the change to the theater building a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants.
Before that, Thomas Bockstadt, Susanne Reichle, Sandra Sch<0xC3><0xB6>ck, Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 blood donations each.
Half as many recorded Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger, while Tamara Pfrommer, Petra Schleeh, Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter gave away 500 milliliters of their life juice ten times each.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the easing of inflation have dampened speculation about a rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain “slow” as it maintains interest rates on family income amid mounting pressure.
The Bank’s Monetary Committee (MPC) policy makers voted 6-2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 percent, with fewer members aiming for an increase this month as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and for 2018 to 1.6%, warning that the pressure on household incomes would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in the fall.
But she signaled that interest rate hikes would be needed in the coming years to curb the inflation fueled by Brexit, and she said credit costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth economic package, which was issued a year after Brexit.
It will require time for the funding plan to provide cheaper funding to banks from next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion more under this system – at <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion.
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate, the bank said: "In the central forecast of the MPC, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on real incomes of households continues to strain consumption."
On interest rates, she reiterated that "some tightening of monetary policy" would be needed to cool inflation and a "slightly larger" scale than markets would expect.
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
However, the bank stressed that increases would take place "step by step" and "limited".
The Bank’s downwardly corrected growth forecasts for this and next year are 1.9% and 1.7%, compared to the forecast in May.
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after this news.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and fell 0.4% to $1.11.
The decision does not change after recent disappointing growth figures dampened rising expectations for an interest rate hike and GDP rose from 0.2% in the second quarter to 0.3% in the previous three months.
Growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although the bank expects it to recover slightly towards the end of the year.
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight wage increases, as the tightening becomes even worse at first before it will then improve.
She added that monetary policy cannot "prevent" the income collapse in the next few years, but added that wages will "significantly" recover by the end of their three-year forecast.
The economy is also boosted by rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak pound, which will offset some of the lower consumption spending.
The decision comes a year after interest rates fell to 0.25 percent last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years for this to fully reach prices and the economy.
Prior to the bank’s last ruling on interest rates, the call for an interest rate hike had risen as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers calling for an increase to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6% last month, although the bank said this was expected and will pick it up again in the coming months.
The bank said the overshoot in relation to its 2% target was “completely” attributable to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again as lenders look for deals loud and want to end the year in a positive way.
The market looks particularly good for those where existing deals expire and new mortgages close, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular.”
NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Patients will be given access to “transformative” HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight before the High Court against funding the drug in the NHS.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now being delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people.
He said he was willing to fund the process after the appeals court upheld a Supreme Court ruling last year that the NHS had the authority to pay for PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an "important new intervention", while the National Aids Trust (NAT) called it a "decisive moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register, and more clinics will follow in October before it will be rolled out across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in those at risk of infection.
Taking PrEP before sex means that there are just enough drugs in a person’s body to prevent HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals, and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated.
In clinics, suitable participants are identified who agree to the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a GP can also sign up for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.
The programme will cost <0xC2><0xA3>10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive procurement.
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is used, recorded and implemented on a large scale.
Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and overcome the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in addressing one of humanity’s greatest health challenges.”
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive of NAT (National Aids Trust), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, when targeted at needy and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic.
From September, people at high risk of HIV will have access to this NHS-funded trial in England to develop a new tool that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives.
We very much welcome this announcement."
Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: “The priority now must be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who is at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that PrEP test medicine has been procured, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people.”
Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said: “The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and end the transmission of this life-changing infection.
This experiment brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out across the country as soon as possible to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help bring us one step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society."
Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, scaled back from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014.
It’s located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace – and it’s proof of the new design that Joanne didn’t pack and sell her bags.
“Before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room,” says Joanne.
“I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and made an offer that day."
Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled.
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make the most of the generous ceiling height.
"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
That was my request,” she says.
To this end, she commissioned the Duck & Shed architectural and design studio of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine where one could stand.
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the problem.
“The steelwork is quite complicated,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend over.
It wasn’t just about building a simple platform, it was about laying the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function up or down.”
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height above each other - with much additional drama.
For the mezzanine floor, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.
Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space, and light.
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it last longer.
In the kitchen, the reflection feels like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all Joanne cutlery and glasses.
By perceiving a more glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.
"A bit of engineering went in there," Erfan explains from the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door.
“It’s counterbalanced, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.”
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m2, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“At the end of the day, you’ll be selling the land – or how your property is valued,” Erfan says.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will step in and perform a calculation based on the floor size."
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.
“The materials are the things that touch you and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home,” says Erfan.
“You don’t fall in love with the electrical outlets in the walls.
These are important, but they don’t play with your heart.”
It shows that an apartment can turn from something standard into something quite amazing through good design and increased square meters.
In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave this one.
Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire
Two brothers find themselves four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in an argument over one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires worth over $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, just three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who took him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided.
Paul had wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but a sharp dispute over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family bought a store on Smith Street, Collingwood, in 1973.
There, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores.
It was sold for $85 million in 1999.
This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis’ portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller, as well as shopping centres in the suburbs.
According to an agreement with her late father, Colin – described by Paul as “the main operator and the dominant personality” in the De Lutis family – owns about two-thirds of the company’s assets and Paul owns about one-third.
A court order states that this means that Colin owns $316 million worth of property and Paul owns $176 million worth of property.
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.
“The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought were the best objects,” he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed mediations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, has excluded him.
Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul of incompetently managing some possessions.
In an early affidavit filed by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.
“My Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority,” he wrote.
Costs rise in the case, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and reports from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and leading lawyers including Allan Myers, QC, and law firms held by both sides.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who ran milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property where Colin opened the family’s first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco there when he was “in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little kid (about 10 years old).”
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their property to their sons.
“Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $10 million and Luke $26 million upon leaving the company.
Both Lukas and Mark, Paul says, “became bitter about the terms of their financial separation.”
Colin has held back a lot, although he was a former AFL board member and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGuire, the best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.
Only Colin responded by text message to say "I really can't say much" because the case was in court.
“It is very, very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to meet his brother’s demands.
“Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute,” he said, adding that he “still hopes for a solution.”
On Friday, that hope seemed to be over.
"Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote.
Trump’s new chief of staff plans to limit the president’s media abstinence.
Others have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If so, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump — including news media reports — in hopes of keeping the chief on a more even course.
Here is a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:
“When John F. Kelly, the new White House chief of staff, met with senior officials on his first day of work, he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump’s White House that he wanted to fix: bad information falling into the president’s hands.
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow — whether on paper or in briefings — because the president would make better decisions if he received good information.”
Kelly’s diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.
President Trump’s relationship with television goes back decades — and now that he’s in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.
“If candidate Trump was upset about unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from positions to be persuaded,” former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg told Politico in February.
Politico’s Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that “the key to keeping Trump’s Twitter habit under control, according to six former campaign officials, is to make sure his personal media consumption includes a steady price of praise.”
Okay, okay.
But the idea that Trump’s Twitter habit was ever “under control” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don’t know about others — that Trump’s tweets would have contained even more fuel without their interventions.
We’ll probably never know anything about the tweets Trump didn’t send.
If his employees have already managed to keep him away from trouble a few times, then their efforts have been worth it.
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from sparking controversy.
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties are repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may be promoting their views of the world.
Politico - fully engaged in this story - reported in May on the preference of advisers to provide the president with dubious information for strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaging leaks, and that he’s determined to find out where they came from.
That’s exactly what happened at the end of February, when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of “being the source behind a bunch of leaks” in the White House.
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment or that he has offered no concrete evidence or that he has made false accusations in the past and recanted them.
Trump read the article and began questioning employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary General Rob Porter “have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives.”
How'd that work out?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later.
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisers are still striving for influence.
These immutable factors make Kelly’s mission very difficult.
Most wanted criminals get mail from Europol
Since the address is unknown, the help of the population is requested and hoped for.
Police across Europe are sending (virtual) postcards this summer to dangerous criminals on the run.
Since the addresses of the wanted serious criminals are not known by nature, information from the population is hoped for and requested.
Europol reported on Friday on the action following the "EU Most Wanted" advent calendar of the winter.
Experience has shown that many refugees are hiding at holiday destinations, it was said by Europol.
21 postcards were collected for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries.
Since 2016, the website www.eumowanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times.
36 of the online searches have so far been arrested, at least eleven of which were based on post-publication information on the website.
Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the ‘millionaires’ series’
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are back on the warpath with some determined travelers who have negotiated a community-drawn ditch to reclaim a field in front of their mansions.
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field off a wealthy street of Solihull called the “Millionaires Series.”
They have brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after being ejected only in May, but without being deterred by a ditch dug by the council to prevent their intrusions.
The tactful group found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unimpeded to find a way.
Angry residents have urged Solihull's council, which said it was "useless to deal with the problem".
An anonymous resident said: “They moved there on Monday night after being sent on by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at the passers-by.
The Council must be forced into action by shame, as it was useless in dealing with the problem.
The travelers were there in May, were moved on and are now back again.
More arrived last night, probably more today.”
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long lectures to protect their parks.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I'm not happy to continue paying my community tax if the council can't even stop it."
A resident who did not want to be named said, "It's ridiculous, we just saw the last round of these travelers just to be looted by another round.
The numbers have increased this time and you’ve even seen a horse in the parking lot.”
A spokeswoman for the Solihull Council said: "We are aware of an unauthorized camp in the countryside beyond Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihull Police to take the necessary legal steps to move forward as quickly as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps to create a picture of the situation where the court has to examine when we present our case."
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise
The former Hotel Birkenhof is the Waldhotel Luise.
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and is scheduled to reopen on March 1 next year.
This is good news for the city.
With the closure of the Birkenhof Hotel by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 nights per year were lost and revenues were also lost by the tourist tax.
In the autumn of 2014, in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees who came to the county, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collective accommodation, which caused controversial discussions.
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by drawing up a settlement plan to secure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not undisputed at the time in the municipal council.
But above all, the mayor of Freudenstadt, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested people at the house at that time.
He should be right.
The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer based in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a three-star-plus-category house under the name Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the Joy City object.
Two in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
Their names are Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
At the former Hotel Birkenhof, construction debris containers have been standing in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out.
The floors were torn out, ceilings partially demolished, old bathtubs removed from the rooms.
The entire hotel building is a single construction site.
There is still a lot to do until March.
"It's actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.
Everything should be "beautiful citizens" later, as Thomas Scherer puts it.
"We want to make a piece of jewelry out of it."
A swimming pool, a spa area and a meeting room are among the amenities.
You do not want to be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad, but already at an elevated downtown level, emphasizes Scherer.
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to stand out widely, Scherer further explains.
Individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel comfortable in the hotel.
He has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and director of tourism Michael Krause, according to Scherer.
The ideas of the city are the same as those of the hotel group.
“We are on the same line.”
Asked about the level of investment, Thomas Scherer does not want to define himself exactly.
Just under a million dollars, he said.
The outdoor facilities are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.
In an inner courtyard, a large terrace is created, which will be accessible from the restaurant, which is public.
Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market".
Russia Affair: U.S. Special Counsel Appoints Grand Jury
In the Russia affair over US President Donald Trump, special counsel Robert Mueller reportedly used a so-called Grand Jury.
The board has taken up work in recent weeks, the Wall Street Journal wrote citing people familiar with the matter.
The newspaper saw the move as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations.
CNN reported that there were already first subpoenas of the panel in connection with a meeting between Trump’s eldest son and a Russian lawyer.
U.S. intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of meddling in the 2016 presidential election campaign.
Mueller is investigating whether there were any agreements between Trump’s campaign team and Moscow.
The investigation is to focus on several men who acted as Republican advisers in the campaign.
According to reports, Mueller also more and more scrutinized Trump’s private and business environment.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that Special Counsel Trump had personally come to the center and investigated the allegation that the president may have obstructed justice in the course of the affair.
The main task of the Grand Jury is to examine the available evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to bring charges.
Grand juries are also called prosecution chambers.
Usually, they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.
The process always takes place behind closed doors.
The panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor’s office to invite people to the trial under oath.
According to CNN, subpoenas have already been issued that revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.
People who participated in the meeting had been asked to make a statement, the report said.
In addition, they should provide documents.
In addition to Trump Jr., Trump’s adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his then campaign manager Paul Manafort were also present.
Legal experts said Thursday night on U.S. television that the deployment shows that Mueller is not intimidating in his work and that he wants to act quickly if necessary.
But it doesn’t necessarily have to mean that the grand jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the prosecution.
Nevertheless, the establishment of the panel is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.
Amid the new revelations, the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents.
“Russia’s history is a total invention,” Trump said.
The topic gives Democrats a chance to “feel good because they have nothing else to talk about.”
His special counsel Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he knew nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury.
But it also usually works in secret, he stressed.
The White House advocated any measures that "fairly" accelerated the work of the Special Counsel.
Former FBI Director James Comey has said three times that he will not be prosecuted against the president.
There was no reason to believe that anything had changed, the statement said.
Mueller, however, had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey.
Because of this outcry, accusations against Trump had become loud that he wanted to obstruct justice.
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump had asked him to stop investigating then-national security adviser Michael Flynn.
The president is under a lot of pressure because of the investigation.
According to U.S. media reports, the White House collected material against the special counsel and his associates.
This sparked speculation about whether Trump would fire Mueller.
Unlike an independent congressional special counsel, such as in the Watergate affair involving then-retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position where he could theoretically be fired at the president’s urging by the Justice Department.
However, several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move.
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday introduced bills that said the special counsel could no longer be fired so easily.
Antarctica: Giant Iceberg Drives in Antarctica
In the West Antarctic, a giant iceberg of almost seven times the size of Berlin has freed itself from the shelve.
This was announced by the Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research in Bremerhaven on Wednesday.
The colossus, which weighs over a trillion tons and covers 5,800 square kilometers, is now drifting north and will probably take two to three years to melt.
With a length of 175 kilometers and a width of up to 50 kilometers, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have recorded in the past three decades.
There is no danger to people from him.
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the collapse of the iceberg is unclear, according to researchers.
Overall, however, there has been a series of unusual ice shelf collapses in the region for around 30 years, writes the US Snow and Ice Research Center (NSIDC) in a factual background.
According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.
The now broken colossus has been a part of the Larsen-C-shell feud so far.
Shellfish swim on the sea and are fed by large glaciers.
It thus grows further and further into the sea and breaks down regularly.
The Larsen C shellfish is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.
To the north of this shellfish, the balance of growth and break-up was disturbed a few years ago.
A complete shellfish has fallen there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
There is a lot of talk about the Larsen-C shellfish being in danger, because the front edge has never retreated as far as it is today.
In addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks off at a key point.
The melting of shellfish and icebergs does not increase sea level, as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it produces after melting itself.
However, the loss of the sea ice causes the glaciers to flow directly into the sea and drain much faster than before.
This could potentially raise sea levels, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).
According to AWI data, the Larsen C shellfish is the fourth largest shellfish in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometers.
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the open ocean about 200 meters.
There it breaks off regularly.
"Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice sheet is now coming into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of Swansea University in the UK.
"This is the longest withdrawal since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed.
Among scientists, it was disputed whether the Larsen C shellfish will now grow again or return in the long term and possibly collapse, said his colleague Adrian Luckman, adding, "Our models say it will be less stable."
But this development will take decades.
Even if these researchers do not trace the collapse of this giant iceberg back to climate change, many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have collapsed in recent decades.
This long tip of Antarctica extends towards South America.
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the Antarctic Peninsula’s ice surface has declined by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s.
The temperature rise contributed to the decline.
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by around three degrees in the past 50 years, making it one of the areas where temperatures are rising the fastest.
CDU wants house rate for staff
As it becomes more and more difficult to fill vacancies, the CDU is demanding to leave the employers’ association in order to become more attractive.
Just before the summer break, the Kreistag managed to win 41 new posts in the administration.
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann.
Now 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them.
The teaching positions at the circle are obviously very much in demand.
Around 620 applications had to be registered for the places to be awarded this year.
Nevertheless, the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.
Currently, there are still 50 unfilled posts at Mettmann.
Among other things, doctors and engineers are sought, as well as forces of general administration.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the Kreistag and counter the lack of skilled personnel in the administration.
According to the request of the parties, the administration is to "develop a concept for personnel acquisition and personnel development".
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of professionals, but also to counteract the shortfall of applicants in a future-oriented manner, it says.
The overall concept should be oriented inwards and outwards, show concrete measures for cross-country beginners and include a training offensive, CDU, FDP and UWG demand.
This sounds like a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were not known in the past.
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.
We are talking about a real "competition of public employers".
In addition, there are a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age.
It is high time to act so that no more jobs remain unfilled.
But Klaus-Dieter V<0xC3><0xB6>lker, leader of the CDU faction, goes beyond the joint motion with his party.
He had just made a big surprise in the Kreistag when he publicly questioned the coverage of personnel costs and stunned the other parties.
Peoples want all possibilities to be checked, which will allow them to leave the municipal employers’ association.
"If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term, the district administration should seek a house tariff with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities," V<0xC3><0xB6>lker said.
As a result, the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the public service tariff regulation actually provides.
The salaries are currently exactly prescribed, raises or more money are only available if you change to a higher level, which is oriented to professional years.
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.
Only a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.
Last but not least, due to the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and District Director Martin Richter have a problem: they have too little staff.
Italy tightens the tone for NGO migrant lifeboats
Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue if they do not comply with new rules for their operations.
“If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work,” Interior Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation Jugend Rettet because its crew had effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human life is and remains our top priority, so we are very sorry that we are currently unable to operate in the search and rescue zone," the organization said in a statement on social media.
“We can only assess all the allegations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat from 'Jugend Rettet', which Iuventa, since October.
It is believed that his crew is taking on inflatable migrants who are delivered to them directly by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can leave so that the ships can be used again.
At least one such meeting allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor’s file, the content of which was published by Italian media.
The crew is suspected of ignoring the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reasons.
Under the Code of Conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be seen as unnecessary but acceptable as they would not entail "substantial changes or impediments" to their rescue actions.
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Minniti said the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescues had dropped sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and co-operate with local mayors had borne fruit.
"In the last few days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries hoping to reach Europe.
Rises and Trials
Nine Weilermer bikers, the "Berliner Au<0xC3><0x9F>enposten" and two guest riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate to enjoy trials and sights for four days.
Three friendly guides were available for this.
The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim in hot summer temperatures along the vineyards.
It was followed by viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Palatinate forest and the adjacent plains.
In the meantime, there were always longer climbs, for which long trials were rewarded.
On the second day we went to Bad D<0xC3><0xBC>rkheim to the Saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt.
Once again, the vantage point was aligned with the vantage point, linked by "flowing" trials and moderate climbs.
In the last two days, many meters of altitude were mentioned again.
Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and taverns brought welcome breaks.
In Bad D<0xC3><0xBC>rkheim, the bikers breathe in the healing sole in the open-air inhaler.
Neustadt was also driven.
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters of altitude, the group had come to know the Palatinate forest from its best side - sporting and cultural.
Console instead of lawn - Bundesliga gears up for e-Sports
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of sweating through the wind and weather fighting over the stadium lawns?
The fact is: E-Sport has long since become a serious industry, a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gags included.
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesliga clubs, which are increasingly engaged in this area.
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015, followed by FC Schalke 04 and most recently VfB Stuttgart, which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and contracted two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen R<0xC3><0xB6>ttgermann.
He is sure that "several more clubs will rise on this train".
Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London will host the first "Interactive Club World Cup", in which the players of various clubs compete against each other.
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.
"Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds in particular, that the young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.
And: The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones.
With prominent e-sports players under contract, you could be present online much more often in these markets than just sending the Bundesliga team to Asia once a year.
What exactly is it about?
In e-Sports, computer games such as League Of Legends, Dota 2, Counterstrike or FIFA football simulation are played at the competition level.
For a long time, as in normal sports, leagues have been established in which the professionals compete against each other.
And at the 2022 Asian Games, E-Sport is already part of the official program.
But is it really a real sport?
For many, the idea certainly needs getting used to.
Ingo Frob<0xC3><0xB6>se has also dealt with the issue for a long time.
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sports - for example, increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
In addition, it requires cognitive skills, technical and tactical understanding, and rapid responsiveness.
Professional gamers should not only train at the console, but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.
"The fit player is a good player."
But Frob<0xC3><0xB6>se also sees problems: "Doping is becoming more and more a topic".
Controls were difficult to perform in online games, and the structures of classical sports were lacking in the scene.
Positively, the scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sports.
The players are traveling internationally, which is like a big global family, as there are no intercultural barriers.
A study by corporate consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association for Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in e-sports.
In 2016, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 million was implemented in Germany, mainly through advertising, sponsorship and major tournaments.
In three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million.
Against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football league, this is not enough.
However, e-sports are “no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey,” the Deloitte advisers write.
Internationally, many countries are already moving forward.
Major markets are Asia and the US, where former basketball players Shaquille O’Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in eSports betting provider Unikrn.
There is a lot going on in Europe too.
In a Norwegian school, e-sports has been introduced as a subject of instruction, says Frob<0xC3><0xB6>se.
In the Netherlands and France, according to Dutt, the Football First League clubs are now obliged to set up an eSports department.
"In the European comparison, Germany is lagging behind," explains VfB board member R<0xC3><0xB6>ttgermann.
To fall into nostalgia alone, and to explain the old days, is no longer enough.
It is about preserving the tradition of the association, but at the same time aligning the company on the modern market.
“We live in a digitalized world,” Dutt said.
“You can’t say that it’s only in football that everything stays the way it always has been.”
Poison egg ade - The egg alternatives for cooking and baking
Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal over poisoned eggs.
Aldi S<0xC3><0xBC>d and Aldi Nord reacted and took all the eggs from the sale all over Germany.
Only eggs that have been shown not to contain fipronil should be taken into the shelves.
Michelle Carter Condemns Texts That Urge Conrad Roy to Commit Suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through texts and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months behind bars and five years on probation.
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killing of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said at the hearing on Thursday: “My family is uncomfortable.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appeal.
She had been facing a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, folded hands and eyes down when she was convicted.
“Their actions have killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
“She ended her life to make her own better.
She took no responsibility,” she said.
"She showed no remorse".
But Carter’s lawyer said it was a “terrible circumstance that she completely regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find that her “age or maturity or even her mental illness had a significant impact on her actions.”
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that "there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try, despite all the pain we will carry with us forever, to be there for his sisters," it says.
Roy's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was "persuaded" by the realization that she would never attend her brother's wedding or be an aunt to his children.
“Not having that one person I’ve been with every day since I was born is a pain I’ll always keep with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
The case seems to set a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask someone else to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.
The case drew national attention after Carter's text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Hang on, jump off a building, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family.
In the moments before his suicide, she wrote, "You have to do it, Conrad" and "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Moniz said Carter sought attention through Roy's death and ordered her to benefit from the case through some press.
The case shared the legal opinion.
Among the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 before being acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, posted in the Los Angeles Times a comment: "Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail."
Joshua Kimmich: Learning from FC Bayern’s new Mini-Lahm
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to captain the Audi Cup is no coincidence.
FC Bayern is confident of a great season for the Confed Cup winner - extra motivation doesn't hurt.
Something was different about his place in the cabin, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even though the extra piece of clothing was very, very small.
But since there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer on the second day of the Audi Cup, of course, he took the tie that was allotted to him firmly on his arm.
"The coach didn't announce it," the Confed Cup winner said afterwards, after his first spell as Bayern captain.
Well, the inning could have been better than 0:2 against SSC Napoli.
But the sign from the coach could also mean Kimmich this way.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as the leader in the C-elf consisting of youth players, debutants and professionals who had just come from vacation, but he.
Sugar is best distributed to those whom you trust a lot, which you want to keep in the mood.
So who was chosen to take on the legacy of Lahm, can only use a small extra motivation well.
Kimmich confirmed: "That's what you want as a player: to take responsibility".
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old flashed across the field as a mini-lamb.
Right back, that's his position now, the white tie on his arm did the rest to her.
And in general, Kimmich worked in this starting formation as the one who can take the rudder in his best hand.
He gave instructions, tried to direct the unplayed squad.
He had the eye for the whole thing, while many others were busy with themselves.
Vidal to overplay his lack of fitness (hardly worked); Renato Sanches to get the hell out of the performance of the Asia trip (could only work conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas S<0xC3><0xBC>le to not stand out negatively in their first appearance in the Bayern jersey.
After all, it worked quite well.
S<0xC3><0xBC>le ran up next to Kimmich, Rudy before the defense, both acting sovereignly.
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult, in addition, S<0xC3><0xBC>le also tried to be successful in the build-up of the game a few times.
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result “was not as we had hoped.”
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut.
Game shifting, change of pace: "For this style I was also brought".
How unusual this Bayern world is still for the newcomers, you saw after the game.
Rudy, for example, did not give one or two interviews in the catacombs, but rather six or seven interviews.
Kimmich said goodbye after a few snappy statements in the back of his new team-mate.
There he heard an interesting sentence from S<0xC3><0xBC>le: "What is going on here, I have already noticed.
At Bayern, you just have to win every game.”
After all, he doesn’t have to teach that to the new.
Alaba motivates <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies
David Alaba believes in the success of our public relations ladies
Austria’s best-known footballer reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the <0xC3><0x96>FB ladies all the best.
The Bayern-Legion<0xC3><0xA4>r is almost a clubmate of <0xC3><0x96>FB-Captain Schnaderbeck and feuds with our ladies.
The tweet of the Austrian Footballer of the Year and Champions League winner should be a special motivational shot.
Our ladies might also need the famous Bavaria-Dusel.
Company satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate minister: Economy praises Wissings Tempo
It often seemed irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate.
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.
Chambers and companies from the region speak at the request of T V of a change in economic policy - while at the same time blaming the old minister.
Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier Companies (VTU), says: "Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked".
Natus sees the biggest turnaround in infrastructure policy: the gap between the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country’s priority list.
This year, the Ministry hopes for a planning approval process, until 2021 the construction law will be in place.
A role in the plans of the country is also played by the western bypass of Trier, which is in urgent need of the Federal Transport Route Plan.
The goal is to get the line into operation in December 2020, says ministry spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus sees this as a way to support regional but internationally competitive companies.
The Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier, as prompted by Wissing, is aiming for a Rhineland-Palatinate label for wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports, which has been stagnating for ten years.
In addition, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company, praises the IHK.
The Chamber of Crafts Trier sees the new Master Bonus as an additional incentive for young trainees, says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach.
There is a premium of 1000 euros for the master’s exam and 2500 euros if graduates become independent within ten years of master’s training.
However, the homework list for the country remains long.
The planned road construction is fast to create facts, at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, CEO of IHK Trier.
Of the 56 new engineers that Wissing wants to hire at the state-run mobility, only 29 have been employed so far.
The IHK is calling for more contracts to be awarded to external offices.
Christian Baldauf, CDU Group Vice-President, points to calculations by the Court of Auditors that the country will invest more than 20 million euros less in the receipt of state roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country, how it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.
It is also encouraging to see the expansion of broadband in the country so far.
In 2016, regional companies had rated the power supply in an IHK survey only with a rating of 3.4.
They complain about overcrowded internet connections and breakdowns.
Former Economy Minister Eveline Lemke, on the other hand, is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind.
The Greens left Lemke in April to become president of a private university in Karlsruhe, where, after four months of disagreements, she had already cleared the field.
Audi to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - automakers face a backlash
A day before Audi’s announcement, BMW said it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company was of the opinion that "there are smarter options than driving restrictions", referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies described the ventures as a recall.
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emission rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The costs for car manufacturers to install plants to neutralize the emissions emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing, which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of slandering the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen’s mistakes by using so-called switch-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with regulations when a car was tested, but go back under normal driving conditions.
In the United States, several Volkswagen employees have been indicted, others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi in Germany was arrested.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focusing on the United States was expanded.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could put a heavy burden on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen’s profit.
This message has the raft on Saturday on the Isar
The city wants to protect the Isar.
In order for the Isar visitors to participate, a raft will be passing through Munich on Saturday, which has a special message.
If you go to the Isar again on Saturday, you will see a large river between Flaucher and Reichenbachbr<0xC3><0xBC>cke.
And this is not a usual raft, with Isar tourists.
But the construction department wants to clarify.
On the raft you can see a large info transparent.
It shows a mountain of garbage.
The start of a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors.
With the motto "True love is ...", the understanding of the Isar as a protected wild river should sharpen.
Last summer the river crossed the Isar and this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious behavior.
Mordillo's Nose and the Laughter Against Suffering
Mordillo was at times one of the most published cartoon cartoonists, the tuber noses of his characters are his trademark.
Even at the age of 85, the Argentine is still drawing and working on a film.
His message: “Laugh, because there is too much suffering in the world.”
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4, 1932, the son of a Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.
In his early years as an artist, he excelled as a cartoonist for greeting cards, among other things, which frustrated him.
“The happiest day of my professional life was the day I lost my job,” he once said.
After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, he made his breakthrough in the late 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in "Star" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many fans.
Over and over again, the artist was inspired by cities.
Large, round Mordillo figures are immersed in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.
In the early morning, according to his own information, he still sits at the drawing table today, working almost ten hours a day.
About calendars, puzzles, books for big and small, T-shirts, plush animals and watches his droll figures continue to find a lot of distribution worldwide.
For six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters.
The main character in the film "Crazy Island" is a giraffe - Mordillo's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand-footed opponent.
For the first time, his characters speak in the 3D film, which is scheduled to be released in 2019.
“I don’t know exactly what they’re going to say, it’s weird for me,” Mordillo says.
The script is not written by him.
That’s why he rather relies on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is produced wordlessly.
Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to drought-like conditions and disease-carrying insects, causing severe headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: “The lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in autumn.
This has an impact on the lifespan of lavender.
There is also a small cicadas, a microbacterium that transmits dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are very many of them."
And there's a lot at stake.
Lavender oil is not only attractive for holidaymakers, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.
So we have fewer parts with essential oil.”
Solutions considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, but also spraying the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and developing varieties that are more resistant to drought.
This year, the town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rh<0xC3><0xB6>n celebrates its 1200th anniversary.
The highlight of the festival is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival.
Kr<0xC3><0xA4>mer, Z<0xC3><0xBC>nfte, Handel, Vaganten or a Landsknechtslager are supposed to be experienced in the city centre these days.
The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico
Riodoce staff usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime, corrupt officials, and incessant drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about safety.
They have been told that it is important to change their routines.
Two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: taking their children to the office, which was the target of a grenade attack in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies.
They ask reporters to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed, perceptions and gut feelings are enough.
There are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being on the payroll of the government or the cartel, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.
There is no respite from the violence, and as the bodies pile up across the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats, and so far this year there have been at least seven deaths in seven states.
Among the latter is its publisher and its inspiration of Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdez wrote in one of his many books on drug-related violence.
His absence is deeply felt, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his middle finger with the word "Justice" hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. Two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts showing his grinning cheeks.
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was established in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, it has initiated only two criminal proceedings.
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organized crime each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
At Riodoce, they still insist on dealing with the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and though the terrain is now even more treacherous.
Without information about the killers, without justice, the meeting has little use for discussing security, Ibarra says.
“It’s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop,” he says.
“As long as we don’t know why, we all distrust.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the state capital of Culiacan.
He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. He was forced out of his car and was shot 12 times, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated as "Twelve River".
The gunman drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two adult children.
Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.
But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.
Since Guzman’s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the country’s bloodiest battlefields as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum.
It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot in the street or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living.
Forget for a minute that there is a state of “quietness” if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Nevertheless, and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.
First, in February there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions at war with Guzman’s sons.
This publication may have upset the sons, suspected gang members bought up every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there.
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he teamed up with five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold $50 worth of shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without encountering the drug problem," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising grew.
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to deal with.
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria Moors Cabot Award" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led.
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid.
"I want to live on," he said at the time of the CPJ award.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa “is a way of life,” he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV.
“You have to take on the task that you have as a journalist – either that or you play the fool.
I don’t want to be asked, “What did you do in the face of so many deaths... why didn’t you tell me what was going on?”
The Riodoce team misses Valdez, the funny bird who could curse like a port worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
He relied on his routine.
He would always wear his hat.
He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, and always sit at the same table there.
Now they ask: Was his love of routine his undoing?
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and stay alive.
“You don’t like it when you’re dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways” to move drugs.
“These things were not allowed,” Bojorquez said.
The result is, even in the best of times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.
Trust your own instincts.
If it smells wrong, stay away from it.
The trouble is, Riodoce editor Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be fooled ... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa – just as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In the room where Riodoce employees met for security training, suddenly no phones were allowed. Days before, it was announced that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.
Outside, two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.
They were tasked by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.
Half jokingly, some of the reporters wondered if these officers were among the 50 percent of police officers the governor himself described as untrustworthy.
It’s been months since the reporters went into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.
For this week’s issue, Riodoce has looked at three main stories.
There was the murder of the brother of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exposé on government spending, which focused on the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the prosecutor’s office.
There was no official word on who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it became time to write what everyone in town knows: that the restaurant is a favorite spot of drug dealers and authorities.
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated almost all political levels for the entire century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been accused of high-profile corruption cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this venue, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military assault.
Just a few months earlier, readers had viewed Valdez’s column as the best informed source on the kidnapping.
"In the past, we would have known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slim body stature.
"Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."
Valdez’s office has been repurposed as a storage room for signs and stickers protesting the killings of journalists because employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.
Reporter Miriam Ramirez picked up a few signs and went to a demonstration the next morning because of another journalist to the prosecutor’s office.
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests, that it is his.
Across the country, journalists have become more vocal by writing down "SOS Press" on sidewalks and buildings in organized protests.
On this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington, D.C., trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case.
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was assassinated, Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and killing them for telling the truth.
She has since asked to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were “surrounded” by organized crime, involved government officials, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that reporters are being killed not only by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces, who were covered up with organized crime.
The media watchdog group “Articulo 19” has attributed more than half of the attacks to police journalists and officials over the past year.
“In Mexico, you die because they want you to keep your mouth shut,” Ramirez said.
Obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect.
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “Here I am because of my reports.”
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her separated head.
Some branches have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of correspondent Miroslava Breach in March.
Others continue, as did El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its director in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their home countries or even the country.
It is a painful decision.
It’s hard to find work in exile, and they’re still watching the streets and looking for dangers.
And sometimes they are hunted, as it seems to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after escaping from Veracruz.
For those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that the drug trade scares him.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a reporter,” he said.
At midnight last Friday, when the last edition had already ended, Riodoce’s editors sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones suddenly began to buzz.
A series of shootings with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.
The war escalated further, as promised by a series of cartel embassies in the region.
From the edge of the curb, they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone.
The title page had to be changed the next day.
Sirens howled nearby - another shooting in the area.
Bojorquez glanced at the police officers who were on duty to see if they were ready.
If they were afraid at all, they did not show it.
Under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, the employees of Riodoce followed in his footsteps.
"How can you even think of closing it," Bojorquez said, "if on the same day Javier was murdered, the intern asked me to send her to the street for reporting."
Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade their enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Now, researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible rhinoceros of a Canadian miner have been so well preserved that experts have described it as “Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.”
It was so well-preserved that they could even find that his scaly skin was of reddish brown — and they said she had had something of an "uneasy past".
The report in the journal Current Biology called him “the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.”
The fossil is a newly discovered species of nodosaurs that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly well-preserved condition has baffled researchers who describe it as “really remarkable.”
According to reports in National Geographic, the armored plant eater is the best-preserved fossil of its kind.
It was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
They spent the next six years uncovering the wild animal within the 2,500-pound (1,100 kg)-heavy clump of earth.
After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.
“If you blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe it was asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature can be seen.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs."
Researchers have found that this plant eater, although covered in armor and resembling a walking tank, was likely threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as countershade, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have allowed it to blend better into its environment and evade its enemies, experts say, suggesting it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature from the Nodosa family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours carefully uncovering it.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.
They discovered the countershading, a widespread method of defense in the animal kingdom, which means that the creature's tip was darker than its underside.
Although counter shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure from meat-eating dinosaurs, that evolution favored concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.
But most contemporary animals that employ countershading—think deer, zebras, or belted animals—are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey, signaling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival.
"Strong predatory behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous must have been," Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the dinosaur’s skin was reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for clues about its life, including its preserved gut content, to find out what it ate as its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, fell into a river and was driven out into the sea, where it sank on its back to the sea floor.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also remains preserved in three dimensions and retains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as it did in the early Cretaceous period.
You don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. If you only squint a little with your eyes, you might almost think he's asleep."
The Cretaceous was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, traversed the earth.
Although the king of them, Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11.5 m) long, six-ton monster.
The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank into the sea after death and was mummified in mud.
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best-preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip.
The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).
It contained two 20-inch-long tips protruding from his shoulders.
The researchers believe that the armored plant eater was swam through western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur’s underwater burial preserved its armor in exquisite detail.
The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the remains still cover bumpy armor plates along the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a lottery win.
The more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes.
Stoned remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armor plates that carry the animal's skull.
His right front foot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.
I can count the scales on his sole."
In the Storm: Mass Karambolage on A8: Many Injured
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8: Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage.
There are numerous injured, miles of traffic jams and gaffers.
On the Stuttgart-M<0xC3><0xBC>nchen motorway (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass car accident at a mass car company late on Thursday afternoon.
According to initial information from the police, around 5 p.m. between the junctions Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district of Aichach-Friedberg) during a thunderstorm, almost 30 vehicles, including probably trucks, were in contact with each other.
At first, there was no information on the exact number of injured.
These are mild to moderate injuries, a police spokesman said.
A large number of rescue vehicles were at the scene of the accident.
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.
In the direction of travel Munich formed a ten-kilometer-long backlog.
As an AZ reporter reports, there were also massive handicaps on the reverse lane - due to numerous gaffers.
The fire department noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers, who now have to reckon with sensitive penalties.
Shortly after 6:45 p.m., a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.
There was a collision between a car and a car.
A rescue helicopter was on its way to the crash site.
Deutsche Bahn: Group tests "comfort check-in"
It’s a moment that almost everyone has experienced before: nothing at all likes to sit on the train and sleep.
Or you are immersed in his work and just have a brilliant thought.
And then: Puff.
Comes the handler and wakes an unsympathetic or rips the passenger out of the workflow.
Ticket control.
But the times of interruptions are soon over.
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing driverless ticket control.
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you have taken your seat and thereby devalue the ticket.
A test operation is currently underway on two routes.
“When the offer comes, we expand it.
It is expected to be available on many other long-haul routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," a railway spokesman said.
"Comfort check-in" the train calls the ticket devaluing without a driver.
In order to use them, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you must have booked an online ticket - which most passengers do anyway.
You must also have purchased it via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway.
Finally, you need a seat reservation.
Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you get on the train, call up your ticket under "My tickets".
The test customers will then see a button for electronic devaluing.
The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the reserved seat Y.
If the train attendant arrives at seat Y during the ticket check, he knows that there is a passenger with an already devalued online ticket.
So you can keep sleeping, keep working, keep silent.
The "check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the train - which in turn should benefit the passengers.
"If you want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train attendants, simply check into the DB Navigator yourself.
This allows passengers to make their travel time on the train more personal,” says Michael Peterson, Marketing Board Member of DB Fernverkehr.
Second plus: “And our employees have more time than today to address individual customer needs.”
Those who often travel by train know that, in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket checks are among the biggest annoyances.
Because often you yourself, but in any case one of the fellow travelers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets.
Either the credit card or ID card is missing or otherwise a document that must be presented.
The result is endless discussions between the train attendant and the passenger, which leads to bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in the control of the own ticket and takes the time at the end of the day to take care of other concerns.
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.
And this also only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked.
How did an activist come to learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.
Just one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis native was sitting on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone.
She stumbled across a post from someone from high school.
"Police have just killed an 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," it said.
Confused that no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the handle @TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on her timeline.
The St. Louis area rapper was about to tweet the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., live.
He posted a picture of Brown’s lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.
“That’s wild,” Ferrell thought to himself.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She dropped off her phone to return to tweets about people on Canfield Drive later that evening.
There were photos of the police band and people screaming, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father carrying a sign that read, "Ferguson's police just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another police officer unloaded his rifle and shouted, "I'm going to... kill animals all of you."
"This is not common," Ferrell recalled her statement.
“That’s not the kind of murder we’ve gotten used to and we can typically call it.”
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and I cried."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father’s house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened over the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?", in cinemas from the 11th.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience, made up of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers.
When Ferrell and her daughter, who was wearing a flower dress and a matching crown, drove to Ferguson, the two discussed a conversation they had countless times before this morning "about the black experience and the black condition."
“You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in?” she recalled what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.
I couldn’t take them with me,” Ferrell said later.
“What happened today is a culmination of ... what happened in the past.
She must know it and see it and be brought up in it.
It must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also know the different layers of black experience and black constitution and what we need to do to become free to free ourselves.
Even though I’m lucky enough to give her an experience where she doesn’t personally experience blatant racism, she’s no different than the next black woman child.
I feel like I would be doing her a bad job of keeping her away."
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police department that became a campground when activists were waiting for the possible non-accusation of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local business owner who made lunch.
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters.
Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.
“My activism has completely changed since August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.
“I had no experience in organizing.
It's all come."
Weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film’s co-directors, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to "document" what happened.
A question came to Ferrell's mind: "Do you want to document or are you trying to find a story that you can take advantage of?"
This skepticism was fueled by countless cases of people, often white, in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience.
As Folayan recently explained in an interview, “We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson didn’t have their voices centered and we wanted to do it differently.”
Folayan had previously worked with then-co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around death row inmates.
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the "Whose Streets?" team in the years following Brown's shooting.
"This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. We speak," Davis said.
“That was the main thing for me how these people are portrayed, because that’s how I’m going to be portrayed.”
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement "is not a messiah leader, but a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film.
As a result, documents from "Whose Streets?" surprisingly show personal aspects of Ferrell's life as she falls in love and marries her wife.
“I felt like naked,” Ferrell said, laughing when she first saw the finished product.
"But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people."
In addition, Ferrell’s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who have shaped the film "BlacklivesMatter" on social media since the killing of black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 identify as gay.
“Black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole,” Ferrell said, “and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.
Black, gay women have to bear the brunt of it all."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really sustained by black women and many black women".
However, she insists that "this is not an affirmative type of action" in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity.
“She was the person who unleashed that energy,” she said.
“It’s not a coincidence that she was at the forefront because there’s so much at stake in a life at these intersections as a black, gay woman.
You can feel their energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, the Ferguson news cameras have long since disappeared, but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist.
Ferrell has been on probation for 21<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home: "a chaos".
Still, she clings to a song and feels committed to that memory since she took to the streets in Ferguson three years ago.
“It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It is our duty to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our chains.”
From "dream" to "big bang": TV readers discuss Bit-Gallery
The Bit-Gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time.
But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.
The subject hardly leaves you cold.
Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the topic is discussed.
While one says to the bit gallery: "That would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be really cool" (Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side: "Don't need a human being" (Siggi Betzen) or quite simply: "Great madness!" (Lars Scholz).
While supporters rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city, which also benefits the other businesses, opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed out.
In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers’ market hall is located, where 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the start of construction work, this will be over.
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - namely to the Beda square with the possibility of sitting outside.
Simone Zimmer: "We have been buying in the farmer's market hall almost weekly for many years.
Mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of rural women always very much like.
We also discovered the butchery for ourselves.
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery.
In other cities there is too.
Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "Whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of rent.
It probably won’t be too low for the new project.”
Eva Kilic: "Why shopping malls in Bitburg?
Whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find this superfluous.
There is enough of that in our city.
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.
But since there is not even a regular weekly market here, it is all the more important that we at least keep the market hall.
After all, the product offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is also inexpensive.
As you can see, shops in a mall are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable for a retailer.
Too bad, there are almost no more special shops and what is left of them will probably disappear."
Wolf Fandel: "A shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit together for me.
And the gallery doesn't fit Bitburg.
First of all: where should the farmers market hall go during the construction period?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run, if the Bit-Gallery actually comes at some point.
Or does the ghost Bit-Gallerie already manage to sell all the shops from Bitburg in advance?"
George Marquet: “It’s just not going to work.
And no one needs a shopping center that is empty.
In my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmers’ market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmers market hall, thanks to the insanely many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg, there is no place anymore.
If the farmers' market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."
A fitting resemblance: Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptibly the same - hanging on cables from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from cheek buds and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after making classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website public.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a trans woman and pioneering dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days left in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg, through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of what someone with this genomic data might look like, has made a sharp, though somewhat intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data – the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of this interpretation.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has spoken openly about identifying as a woman since her teens, was convicted in 2013 on 20 counts, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much so that there was only one photo—a grainy, black-and-white selfie in which Manning sits visibly uncomfortable in a driver’s seat and wears a platinum-blonde wig—with which she was associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.
In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to create a picture of what these people might look like.
That was the moment she received an email from a newspaper magazine.
“They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted some sort of portrait to accompany this article,” Dewey-Hagborg said at a press preview of the new exhibition.
And she couldn’t be visited at the time and she couldn’t be photographed, so they contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to do a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequaled letter friends who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even created a Shoili Kanungo-illustrated “Suppressed Images” comic that predicted a future in which President Chelsea’s judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition in person.
That Obama would actually demand Manning’s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas just days after the book was published was a welcome kind of happy reunion.
There is also something deep and strong about the opening of the exhibition now that Donald Trump is waging a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, second-rate ways to further ignite the rigid divisions he was supposed to fix.
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning, with her oversized signature below (the "i" in her family name is provided with a heart) called for an end to the "automatic fragmentation based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."
On the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence – a thousand-foot-tall of Cs and Gs and As – is written in pencil.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the artist’s highly developed scientific lexicon) how amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are.
“What people will hopefully take away from this is that our genome doesn’t care about who we are and how open genetic data is to an interpretation and how subjective they are,” said Dewey-Hagborg, whose 2007 video work, Spurious Memories, is also on display.
“DNA data can tell so many different stories, so that’s 30 of those stories.”
The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the comic novel mentioned above.
She shows Manning how she shows up with a hands-free phone in her hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King-Kong.
“If they put your speech in the cold, they won,” he said.
"So never keep your mouth shut".
"It came directly from a letter she wrote me," said the Philadelphia-based artist.
"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition – as predicted in the comic book – but if she should do it, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, by her own genomic simulacrums huddled together like hordes of protestors.
This was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, down to the size (5<0xE2><0x80><0xB2><0xE2><0x80><0xB2> 2, Manning’s stature), where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil.
“In the past, I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd,” Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also behind their liberation."
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted for murder
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects after a man was stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment with fatal injuries.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were issued arrest warrants for murder for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the Cook County District Court records show.
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stab wounds.
A joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Department says the body was discovered on July 27.
Officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries to his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the scene, and detectives are investigating the stings as murder, while police are actively searching for the two suspects, officials said.
Lathem has been an Associate Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, vice president of university relations, said in an email statement that Lathem was now on leave and had been excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus.
"This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the relevant authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with this investigation," Cubbage said.
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an emailed statement that "we are in contact with the police in the UK and ready to help the US investigative authorities in any way we can."
The statement added that Warren’s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up.
Chicago Police Chief Communications Officer Anthony Guglielmi said he was urging the suspects to turn themselves in to the authorities.
"The police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip saying something had happened in Apartment 1008.
The police described the scene as very cruel.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27.
Security cameras confirmed that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management team released a statement to residents: "Police are currently working on the victim's timeline and background and are investigating a variety of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
"We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future" - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) are implemented.
"At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the timetable, RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA timetable has been updated in this regard," Mutko said on Thursday.
The PM commented on the second part of WADA’s Roadmap to Compliance with the Code, which describes the criteria for RUSADA’s reinstatement and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern.
“Everything has been announced, everything is being implemented.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added.
However, one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA-approved investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren into alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport.
Regarding the matter, Mutko said: “We are conducting the investigation as our anti-doping system has admitted an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no state programs, and we won’t admit anything that doesn’t exist.”
Mutko’s words were in agreement with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian anti-doping commission.
Speaking to the Russian outlet RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally," Smirnov added.
In November 2015, RUSADA was banned from conducting doping controls in Russia in the wake of the WADA doping scandal.
However, she was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization’s headquarters in Moscow in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving “in the right direction” to be deployed again.
Aldi no longer sells eggs
This was shared by the corporate groups.
This is a purely precautionary measure, and it cannot be assumed that there will be any further adverse effects on health, the statement said.
From now on, only eggs are expected to be delivered to Aldi, which have been tested negative for fipronil-containing anti-litter.
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency among its customers.
The Start-Ups That Will Help Your Business Not Become the Next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure your employee’s happiness at your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys didn’t work.
Answers were often vague, unhelpful, or - even worse - fraudulent.
And even if you promised anonymity, some workers don’t trust the process.
“There just never was consistency and objectivity,” said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce hair care company Madison Reed.
She's been calling outsiders for help.
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it allows companies to conduct surveys, address special groups and demographics, provide employees with anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to directly engage with the C-suites and management.
“You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track your health, but where is the Fitbit for your business?” said Jim Barnett, co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said they gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel over the three years with Glint.
In addition to Snap surveys and surveys from specific teams, it offers a company heat map that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval scores – so you can see why.
Companies are coming to realize that you need to stay at the forefront of workplace culture so you don’t become the next Uber to be embroiled in scandals since a former employee posted a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who spoke were punished.
For start-ups like Glint, this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity.
The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion in 2020, according to financial technology website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, the start-up Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a rising interest and activity earlier this year amid the Uber case in disrepair.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has recently signed up as a client.
Like Glint, Convercent lets companies send customized “pulse” surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view the heat maps of your problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that lets employees report bad behavior.
And when the Chief Executive Officer is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.
“The court of public opinion has seized the regulators,” said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is found to be treating its employees poorly or behaving unethically, it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott, worker fluctuation, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, file a formal complaint, and hope that it was taken seriously.
It was often an intimidating and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday’s General Counsel, who said there was no good way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems previously hidden by executives in offices in cities or states—such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair practices—can be more quickly identified and addressed.
“I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment,” said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday’s Risk Management Group.
"And we're protecting our shareholders from employment litigation."
Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.
But it took until the “social media came to their right” that companies realized they couldn’t prevent their dirty laundry from going online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and charge companies with recurring fees for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups.
Convercent received $10 million in funding in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.
Glitzern secured $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire funding to $60 million.
These investments come as little surprise, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
There is a growing complex of research showing that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are just stakes.
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you are giving your time to a company with a positive mission.
“If people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices and that the work you do is worth it, then they feel more committed to making that company successful,” said Nina McQueen, vice president of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. Companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase engagement and employee engagement, it’s no wonder you’ll find support.
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action.
In fact, when a company asks employees for their feedback, they may have an expectation that change is on the way.
And if the change doesn’t come fast enough, or not at all, it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.
“If you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations,” said Russell Raath, president of consulting at business management firm Kotter International, which has seen companies relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t follow, employees will ask themselves, ‘Did you really hear me?
Do you take care of it?
And who don’t you care about, why should I?”
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint, Errett said.
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganise multiple teams within the company and add communication training to address the issues.
At Ruby Tuesday, the company is always getting new insights about employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this will lead to better employee engagement in an industry known for high revenue.
“If you’re not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you’re going to lose people,” Vitrano said.
"And if you lose people, you lose customers too.
And if you lose customers, then you will lose businesses.
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins
It’s approaching 11 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players are chatting on one side of the team’s new practice fields on campus.
Some have pulled out their jersey tops and show their backs full of sweat from the first day of training camp.
For a good part of the team, these idle minutes are a lunch break.
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before returning to Wasserman Football Center the next morning at 6:30 a.m.
“This is a real treadmill for the guys over the next three days,” Bruins coach Jim Mora said shortly before Monday became Tuesday.
The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden on players, and it has actually extended its days – at least until the final on Friday.
That’s why the first three UCLA trainings should start at 7:15 p.m. to meet players’ already packed schedules.
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and conducted practical exercises for the first time during Mora’s six seasons at Westwood during summer school.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practice sessions during August. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supports the NCAA rule change, even if it adds another point to the players’ busy routes.
“We put this enormous strain on them for three or four days, and it’s very challenging,” Mora said.
"And they just pushed it through, they keep sticking, they're great people.
I think as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time, it's going to be really great."
UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is over, which will not be an easy task given the clear lines of sight of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjacent Luskin Center, a hotel of the upscale class that has already been thrown with footballs that housed a safety net behind a goalpost.
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admitted there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
“That’s a real problem, and it’s not far off to think that people are renting a room there and then adjusting to recording an exercise there.
If you have the video tape of an exercise, it’s a pretty good deal.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces on parking lot 8.
We will do our best with what we have.
I'm not too worried about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reports to third-party fact-checkers and then display their results under the original post, the world’s largest online social network said on Thursday. It’s one of its efforts to fight so-called fake news.
The company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false reports and send them to fact-checkers who may be displaying results of the fact-checking from the original article.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news, many of which believe they also influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe, with French voters flooded with false stories ahead of the May presidential election, and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hate-filled posts like they did before the September elections there.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-check will be launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to knowing which stories are being challenged by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share,” Sara Su, product manager for Facebook News, said in a blog post.
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the “related article” and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce fake news.
Creating a Comic Novel: A Castle in the History of England
In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in Kent’s Bewl River Valley and has now become the inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaary Yorkshireman with a fondness for historical documents.
“I think it’s so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who’s been dead for 300 years,” he says indignantly.
"What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' spans the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era, documenting the families who lived in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It’s not the first book by Rhodes to be based on an archive: he wrote ‘Dead Men’s Teeth and Other Stories’ in 2014, a collection inspired by documents in the British Library – a project he found unexpectedly emotional.
“I only responded to the thumbprint on the page of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins,” he says.
"That's his thumbprint!
And letters always smelled of smoke, because then a fire was lit because of the light.
For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he himself were also in it.
I love the archives!”
For someone who is beaten with old papers so that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I overestimated my welcome a little"), this all seems too nice to be true.
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, going through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.
Then, at night, he drank "Whiskey and began to write".
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees were just starting to take care of the archive he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said 'Oh, throw it on the attic'."
Diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, maps depicting who owned what: "You might think that land conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch to have fought for the two families.
Guys, let it all go!"
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to delve into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Uprising of 1381.
"There is a record of a riot that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought a revolt was a good start.
Maybe the two of them are related?”
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit Father, whom the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or 'The Smuggler', which depicts 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell staging his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated).
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney: "The gentlemen seemed to be quite crooks, repeatedly making debts and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women—I imagine them to be a bunch of good-looking guys, with a talent for promoting heirlooms.”
After the end of his deployment in the castle, Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences
He has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El<0xC3><0xA4>m<0xC3><0xA4>nm<0xC3><0xA4>ki, the site of an early 20th century sanatorium that has since been reclaimed by nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
“I was sad to go again,” he says.
It was like, "Oh, now I have to deal with the damn life again."
Campaign launched: Over 300-year-old Marienkapelle in Rh<0xC3><0xB6>ndorf covered
With the unveiling of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rh<0xC3><0xB6>ndorf, the city of Bad Honnef on Friday started its campaign to introduce a new roof brand (Thursday’s roundabout).
Until Thursday, Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret.
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign.
"Too good for us.
Or?", asked the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh<0xC3><0xB6>ndorfer Kapelle.
"We don't really think that (of course!)," they wrote on their website yesterday.
“But we are using this measure to get your attention.
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem.
Basically, we firmly believe that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city."
The action is about more than just a logo and a slogan.
"It is necessary to formulate a stand-alone promise, one that gives the city a distinctive stand-alone feature".
After all, they are in competition with other municipalities.
The city of Bad Honnef can afford its new roof brand and the campaign for an average five-digit amount.
Military Reforms in Turkey - Erdogan's Fear of the Army
Every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) in Ankara advises on pensions and promotions in the officer corps.
Same this week.
At first glance, a normal process.
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt.
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building, as before, but in the Prime Minister’s office.
Under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, the five Deputy Prime Ministers, as well as the Ministers for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the deliberations.
As a result, the number of civilians in the YAS increased.
The government is pulling the strings in the military.
Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the commanders of the army, air force and navy have been deposed.
Since the failed coup, Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army – mostly due to alleged links to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah G<0xC3><0xBC>len, whom Erdogan sees as a wiretap of the coup attempt.
A total of 486 people believed to have been directly involved in the coup attempt have been held in Ankara since this week.
The day after the coup, Erdogan had described the coup attempt as a "gift of God" because it gave him the opportunity to "completely clean up" the armed forces.
But is Erdogan really in control of the army?
At the end of February, the newspaper "H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet" published an article entitled "Distress in the military headquarters".
There are concerns in the General Staff about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which manifested itself, among other things, in the lifting of the ban on headscarves for female soldiers, the newspaper wrote.
In any case, the large-scale cleaning of the army and the security forces continues.
In mid-July, Erdogan ordered another 7,395 civil servants to be fired by decree, including 2,303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
At the same time, it seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.
The generals were considered earlier than the actual lords of the country.
Three times they purged, citing their role as guardians of the secular state order.
After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least citing the reform provisions of the European Union.
Former officers say Erdogan is deliberately pushing for an Islamization of the armed forces.
In the magazine "Vocal Europe", an unnamed officer, who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad, warned that the Turkish army would be "full of extremists and Salafists" in a few years.
If that is the case, such a development could not leave NATO cold.
However, after the purges, there is doubt in the Alliance about the readiness of the Turkish army.
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are “weakened,” say NATO diplomats.
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
There will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump said, quoted by the media.
He plans to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, tightening rules for obtaining visas for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family-oriented visas.
The new rules are proposed by Republicans and supported by the president.
The bill will be discussed in both chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and will do so by changing the way the U.S. will issue green cards to citizens from other countries.”
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system.
“This new application process will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
Ministry wants to renovate route for Rennsteigshuttle
Over the past few months, the future of the racetrack shuttle had been discussed again and again - now it should be done very quickly.
Even before the end of the year, it is to be built on the marauding track on which the tourist railway runs.
In order to secure the future of the racetrack shuttle in the long term, construction work on the line is expected to begin this year, according to the Ministry of Transport.
"With the decision to further order and renovate the Ilmenau-Rennsteig route, the country is committing to this connection, which is especially important for tourism," State Secretary for Transport Klaus S<0xC3><0xBC>hl said in Erfurt on Friday.
He estimated the cost of repairing the track at about 2.5 million euros.
Of this amount, the country takes over 75 percent.
The contract, on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country in the future, is currently being finalized, S<0xC3><0xBC>hl said.
The Ministry and the S<0xC3><0xBC>dth<0xC3><0xBC>ringen Bahn as operators already agreed on the technical details.
"This is the timetable, the vehicles used and the quality standards negotiated," said S<0xC3><0xBC>hl.
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years.
This means that the Rennsteig-Shuttle will be ordered on a regular basis in December 2017.
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular rail connection between Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations.
In recent months, it had been tested during a pilot operation whether the route is used by enough people to order it again regularly in the future.
In addition, the track is in parts very difficult to build.
The rise of sex robots is real, and we should be worried
Just when you thought it couldn’t get any more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes out.
Yeah, actually.
Sex robots are a big deal right now.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking their rise seriously.
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.
“People are making fun of them, but companies are delivering a lot of it, and we’re going to see them a lot more often,” Mr. Sharkey said in the release of his new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm – with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence.
The user can also "customize" his robot according to his beliefs and choose everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails.
But it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots possess the “personalities” that would make a Stepford woman look progressive.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into robots with a silicone skin.
The RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing, such as shyness.
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah", which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventure" personality.
“Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible,” the True Companion website says.
So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her moods throughout the day - just like real people!
She can be tired, fixated on conversation, or she can be “in the mood”!
There are many disturbing aspects to this rise of sex robots — not least because they replace real human relationships — but the submissive female qualities, the allusions to rape, when one takes a step toward Frigid (here called: resisting) Farrah, worry one the most.
On its website, True Companion compared Roxxxy to a vibrator, but for men.
"If women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men have a roxxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy.
Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Of course, most men will not keep sex robots, and while the FRR notes their increasing popularity, they still remain on the edge of consumer culture for the time being.
But what permeates from the fringes can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time in which we live.
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so.
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots emerge at a time when women’s rights are under threat worldwide, when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of sexually assaulting women.
The most frightening aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' is not the graphic images, the devoured bodies and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision looks.
The Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it doesn’t feel like a big leap.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (albeit with pornstar proportions).
Their builders want them to feel human, to imitate the movement of a real body.
But, brought to the point when it comes to their "personalities", the robots do not represent real women.
You can’t separate yourself from your partner or just walk away.
They have no mediation or a background story, nothing that hints at independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission.
In other words, they are willing slaves.
Or to put it in the 2017 speech: Maids
Trump's big performance?
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense
It has become a bit of a Trump-era wisdom that the political divides that have polarized the U.S. election have also split families in small size.
Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the U.S. offering advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump’s voting relatives.
We all allegedly tighten ourselves to let our filter bubbles burst.
Less noted is Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been involved with the Republicans in our family, visited me in New York this week.
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican kinship she’s fought with for decades over politics, is suddenly and strangely on the same side.
Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it strikes me in a further context that this also brings with it significant risks.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the chilling effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are referring to the scary possibility that his kittens will not repel us one day.
However, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “normalizes” right-wing Republicans who suddenly appear to be the epitome of reasonableness when compared to his standards.
I find myself today plagued by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney’s hilarious version of the madman – the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew what his tax return looked like) – both of which in fact appear to be very mild offenses compared to Trump.
If Trump goes, the next Republican candidate only needs to be mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement.
When my cousin was in town, we took our kids to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the New York City park department's carousels, and the best three dollars you can spend in town if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all the clowns are grumpy and the animals twist to look scared over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the clipping music conveys this in a strange way.
So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings get old, the skylines become too familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I’m still not quite through the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is not really a Swiss cottage – the themed pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn’t count – but a major roundabout in north London.
However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-olds, an 11-year-old and two women in their 40s can go for it and all have a great time.
If I could have rated the carousel, I would have given it the full score, but luckily no one asked for it.
On the other hand, this week in a department store, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could swipe through my credit card.
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to match the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something over the counter.
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is needed.
The poor woman in the department store stood apologizingly grinning as I got tired of the experience of giving her my five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
Pistorius has left prison for a second time for a hospital visit.
Last year, he was taken to the hospital for treatment of cuts on his wrists, which he reportedly suffered from prison authorities following a case in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal by prosecutors against a first murder conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine’s Day 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabinet in his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal intruder who was hiding in the cabin.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to press charges this time against Pistorius Appell’s six-year prison sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, and the appeal could be heard this year.
Pistorius faces the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
When Farmer Arnold Finds a Strange Egg
As the last of the Blumberger schools, the quarter-classmen from F<0xC3><0xBC>tzen and Epfenhofen were released to the holidays and to the secondary schools.
Three of the graduating students will go to high school in the future, four to the real school.
Head teacher Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the B<0xC3><0xBC>rgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening.
As a symbol of the school’s dismissal, the 29 students of the four classes, led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken farm, but then is released into freedom.
In addition, the cheerful crowd performed a musical entitled "Der Eagle im H<0xC3><0xBC>hnerhof".
Farmer Arnold found a strange egg, and had it hatched by his chickens.
Instead of a chicken coop, a little eagle came out.
But the hope of turning him into a chicken was shattered, and the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain and disappeared.
After that, classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank’s introduction.
The hens danced with the young goggles that the cylinders wore to the bet.
The eagle stands for integration, said school head Angelika Sitte.
The young animal is different from the other young animals (chickens), but it belongs to them.
He will never be like a chicken.
Its purpose is to be free.
She wanted every fourth grader to feel accepted into her new school.
It was followed by a word of thanks to the colleagues, the former headmaster Michael M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, who repeatedly jumps into the classroom, and the parents' representatives.
The time for chicks is now over, explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher.
She is very reluctant to fire her students after two years of teaching, because it was a really great time.
Finally, she was able to rely on the fourth graders.
At the end, all the students sang a song of summer time and holiday time.
There was great joy in the children.
Eight first graders have already registered for the new school year.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
Two Bulgarians have been detained for illegal camping in Greece, the Foreign Ministry said, citing TV reports.
On the morning of 1 August, police arrested a group of illegal campers in Sithonia, including the two Bulgarians.
They were released on the same day, while an investigation is currently underway.
The Foreign Ministry reported to bTV that the Bulgarians were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and impose substantial fines on anyone found staying in a place not intended for that purpose.
Checks will continue throughout the season.
The ministry said the court could impose a fine.
Diesel Vehicle Software Update: What Affected People Need to Know Now
How exactly does the software update take place?
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action?
The most important questions and answers at a glance.
At the diesel summit, BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars.
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6.
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded.
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europa gives opinions:
Is the new action mandatory?
No, the software updates negotiated are voluntary.
“The mandatory updates previously only apply to vehicles that have foam software,” says Anja Smetanin.
Their retrofitting has been ordered by the Federal Motor Transport Office (KBA).
How and when will customers be informed about updates?
The manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the coming months, but have not yet announced an exact date.
Daimler has announced that it will write to all affected parties.
If an inspection is due anyway, this will be done within their framework.
How long will the overall restructuring take?
“It’s hard to say,” says Smetanin.
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as on the political pressure.
"Because we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the issue of the environment so far."
How long should the update take?
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It can be more time-consuming to get an appointment.
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Group do?
The ACE advises to wait.
Foreign producers are likely to follow suit, according to Smetanin.
Is there a threat of a massive decline in the price of Euro 4 cars?
The ACE is afraid of that.
But only in regions where driving bans threaten.
There has been no loss of value for older diesels in rural areas.
The ACE advises to wait with a sale.
LL Cool J Receives Kennedy Center Award
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington.
The first award ceremony under President Trump promises to become political.
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest.
LL Cool J (49) is the first rapper to receive one of the prestigious Kennedy Center awards.
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday, this year also singer Gloria Estefan (59), Lionel Richie (68), choreographer Carmen de Lavallade (86) and TV producer Norman Lear (95) are among the honored.
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December.
Traditionally, US President Donald Trump will host a reception and attend the ceremony together with his wife Melania.
The award-winner Lear, who became known for his progressive TV series, has already announced that he will not participate in the gala.
He told the New York Times: “This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights – even to deprive them of the means – and that is burdening me.”
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view.
Named after former President John F. Kennedy, the Kennedy Center is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital.
Former winners include Meryl Streep, Aretha Franklin, Robert De Niro, George Lucas, Tom Hanks and Sting.
We make the city worth living
Roland Wacker, Haslach’s city builder, will retire next year.
The job is already advertised - however, suitable applicants are rare.
For 31 years, Wacker has been a city builder.
And the work still makes him a lot of fun, as he conveys in the press conference.
He reports on varied, but also challenging tasks waiting for his successor.
At the same time, he is surprised that so far no application meets the requirements profile.
The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer as soon as possible.
Thus, taking into account the regular deadlines for termination, there should still be enough time for admission.
Since Haslach acts as a lower building law authority for the administrative community, the applicant must present corresponding diplomas.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they could no longer fill these out, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice.
But citizen proximity is important to the city and to itself, says Wacker, who reports on a good operating climate and good mood between government and citizens.
In more than 30 years in office, some significant projects have accumulated, to which Wacker looks back with pride.
"We make the city worth living," he said, confident of the building authority and its employees.
But also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking lot, for example, are under way.
The Kinzigbr<0xC3><0xBC>cke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renovated, and the stadium renovation is still an issue.
The latter alone will hit the book with around 1.5 million euros, "if we do it right", estimates Wacker.
"All in all, great tasks are waiting for my successor.
The work here is fun."
There is a lot of room for a master builder to design.
With Haslach’s own construction yard and gardening, you can react to many things quite flexibly.
"You can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors.
As the old town as an ensemble is under monument protection, it is important to have "an eye for what fits in" when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city builder emphasizes.
In any case, the city builder bears high responsibility.
He is the builder, "in the end everything runs here over my table".
In terms of supervision and coordination, he can count on long-term employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been with us for ten years, Manfred Sch<0xC3><0xB6>ner (Diefbau) has been with us for 15 years.
Also, that his successor will remain for a long time, Wacker wishes: "We are looking for someone who really identifies with the place and wants to stay".
Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further design of the city.
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker, according to the information of the city of Haslach, you should be able to present a completed degree as a graduate engineer or bachelor with a specialization in architecture and have good knowledge in the areas of building regulations and planning law.
The City Construction Office is responsible for civil engineering and civil engineering, construction management, land acquisition matters, management of urban properties, the City Works Court with a building yard and city gardening, as well as the Lower Building Rights Authority including monument protection.
Bicycle thrown on wires: South Railway route blocked
According to police, the previously unknown offenders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of Leobener Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e (B116) onto the lines.
These were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.
Investigators come from two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night hours.
Near the crime scene, witnesses had observed a pink scooter and a bicycle driver.
"This goes far beyond a slapstick trick," <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch told the APA.
The perpetrator or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered the train traffic.
In addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant, as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement, could also be sent to the perpetrators.
All in all, a "substantial" sum should be assumed, the spokesman said.
The damage was fixed again on Friday afternoon, the rail traffic on the southern railway line could be carried out without disabilities.
Nearly ten passenger trains had failed on Friday morning, two of which involved long-distance transport.
Freight trains did not run out, but they were late.
According to <0xC3><0x96>BB spokesman Christoph Posch, about 200 meters of overhead lines had to be replaced.
Insulators and masts were also damaged.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate could help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare to your digestive system.
But a new study claims the exact opposite: A diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition, which affects about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not enter the body.
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.
If the balance tends too far in the direction of inflammation, this can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.
In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in their guts.
And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have established a link between a bacterial species – Lactobacillus reuteri – which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells.”
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet would promote less inflammatory bowel disease if the same system worked in humans as well.
Postdoctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found that one group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same strain, which was housed separately, did not.
She suspected that the difference had to do with the gut microbiomes of the mice — the community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells but were missing in the mice without them.
Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so they lacked a gut microbiome and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells formed.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers allowed L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid—without the bacteria—to immature immune cells isolated by the mice.
The immune cells evolved into the tolerance-promoting cells.
When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's feed, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She said: “Development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the gut.
Potentially, high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has committed to a "genius" with Nemanja Matic
At Manchester United, Nemanja Matic has signed a "genius", believes Jose Mourinho, after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening.
Chelsea’s <0xC2><0xA3>40m signing began with a 2-1 win in Dublin, the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid starts on Tuesday, and impressed in the keeper’s role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira made their mark.
Matic, however, had been excluded from the Blues' pre-Asian tour and managed only 45 minutes, which Mourinho conceded he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," Mourinho said.
"We will help him to be ready sooner rather than later."
In addition to Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season.
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more re-commitments, but he insisted the club had already done a "fantastic job" of meeting three of its four priority re-commitments.
"To get three out of four, I thank the club for that," he added.
“I’ll be happier if they get four out of four for me, but they’ve put a lot of effort into it.”
Boeing "painted" Dreamliner in the sky
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner in the sky.
The pilots flew from Seattle in Washington, D.C., but the drawing began in Marquette, Michigan, and moved in the form of a dreamliner over the U.S., which is several thousand kilometers.
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute.
On the radar screens was to be the shape of a dreamliner.
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines.
Boeing has done this kind of advertising before.
So the number "787" and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky.
New low for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
How the wind is turning: When Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD leader, Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern before elections.
Just no disturbance from the party headquarters, just no headwind from the alliance - that was the main wish of the campaigners.
Since Martin Schulz led the party, this has changed fundamentally.
Since then, the employees of the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching with increasing horror the events in the SPD-ruled state capitals.
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwinds.
They were low blows.
One after the other.
After the surprise end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony, the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens.
"This shows once again: Red-Green simply cannot govern reliably," CDU General Secretary Peter Tauber told the editorial network Germany (RND).
The surprise resignation of a Green MP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil (SPD) into a serious crisis.
Five months before the general election, his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from the CDU and FDP.
The Green Federal Executive Michael Kellner has asked the apostate Lower Saxony Green MP Elke Twesten to return her mandate.
The transition to the CDU means a clear falsification of the will of the voters.
Every Twesten must immediately return their mandate," the German leader and campaign leader of the Greens told the editorial network Germany (RND).
"This must not be true at all," sighs an SPD campaigner, when the new job message reaches the party headquarters on Friday morning.
Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, is there after the transfer of the green MP Elke Twesten to the CDU without his own government majority.
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of major and minor crises in SPD country associations.
And no one knows what's coming next.
The misery began with the unexpectedly significant defeat in the Saarland election in March.
A blue eye, no more, the comrades calmed down at the time.
After the parliamentary elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia, everything will be different.
It was then too - and it all became much worse.
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the brink, the D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf-Pleite haute the party smoothly.
In the weeks that followed, the comrades labored again.
Then, when they had just gained new courage, came the G-20 summit in Hamburg.
And with him came the next blow.
Mayor Olaf Scholz, the last strong SPD leader, lost his nimbus that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his city was on fire.
And because in the crisis communication afterwards he did pretty much everything that can be done wrong.
Since then, Scholz has been fighting for his political survival.
And then there is Stephan Weil.
Due to the VW exhaust gas affair and his role on the Supervisory Board, the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been criticised for a long time.
Small survey values were added.
Nevertheless, or perhaps precisely because of this, because in the past few weeks, Weil has tried increasingly to put accents in the Bund.
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were also not hidden from comrades in the circle of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him to do so because they promised to stabilize the party.
Now the exact opposite could occur.
In doing so, Weil is basically not to blame for the party’s internal dispute between the Lower Saxon Greens.
Schulz is not.
In the meantime, the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed.
Their anger is directed at the Greens, and here above all at the apostate parliamentarian Twesten.
"It is intolerable and damaging to democracy how Mrs. Twesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else," says Matthias Miersch, head of the party links in the SPD Bundestag faction, the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to parliament because of her person as a direct candidate, but because of the state list of the Lower Saxon Greens, according to the Lower Saxon MP.
The logical consequence would be that she would give back her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, head of the SPD Bundestag faction, deplored an "undemocratic maneuver."
"The will to vote four years ago was clear: the people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister," says Oppermann, who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as the top candidate in the Bundestag election, to the RND.
"Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MP falsifies the election result," Oppermann said.
He asked me to explain the background.
I want to know if there has been more or there have been further commitments of the CDU Lower Saxony.
Funding for Local Core III
If you want to renovate your house that has come in years, you can soon get support from the country.
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Urban Development informed about this on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what has happened so far.
Since 1991 there have been redevelopment areas in Recfingen.
At that time, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding.
In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the previous renovations are a "successful project" - it is, after all, important to promote interior development, and not only to open new construction areas.
On 4 April, information was received from the Government Bureau of Karlsruhe that there would be a redevelopment area III.
The funding amounted to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euros came from the country, the rest from the municipality of Empfingen.
How does a redevelopment area come about?
Schindler went on to say, “We’re going to investigate where the ‘really old’ houses are.”
However, it also plays a role whether there is any interest in renovating in the planned area.
If necessary, the territorial boundaries could then be shifted again.
The STEG represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening.
Keller presented the contents of the Federal-L<0xC3><0xA4>nder-Programme "Social City", in the context of which the renovations would then be carried out.
At the heart of the programme are the revitalization of inner cities, the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure.
The measures would be object-related, i.e. per plot of land.
The rehabilitation area would then eventually be established as a statute.
The grant period for the grants runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
Until September this year, however, the inventory survey would only be carried out once, in the context of which the participants in the rehabilitation area would receive a questionnaire to fill out.
In November or December, the statutory decision should be made as far as possible, so that the renovations can begin in the coming year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.
It is a matter of assessing the urban problems and deciding when and to what extent they will be rehabilitated.
A renovation note will then be entered in the land register for the respective plot.
Pietzschmann himself will come to Recfingen again and take a picture of the situation, she promised.
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.
Therefore, there will be questionnaires that will be mailed to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out by the end of the summer holidays.
The yellow questionnaire is the "building and plot sheet", which deals with, among other things, the construction condition and the renovation intentions.
In the grey questionnaire, the "household and housing sheet", information on size, distribution and residents of a living space can be made.
The blue "operating arc" is only to be filled in if business premises are operated in the building.
However, it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding.
In addition, new construction measures are not eligible.
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding works according to the "wind dog principle" - who comes first, grinds first.
You can't "reserve" funding for later.
Finally, photos of the project "Ortskern II" were shown in order to make a renovation "tasty".
British inventor sets himself a microchip to get into house and car with a handshake
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so he can open his front door, enter his office, and even start his car with a handshake.
Steven Northam, 33, had implanted the tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger and is now offering the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq.
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implant procedure is performed to medical standards.
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northam’s company also wants to change the locks on homes and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a surcharge of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology, which starts when his hand is in the steering wheel.
The White House’s advertising costs cost taxpayers thousands of dollars.
The White House’s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights U.S. manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $24,000, according to military figures left to TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of the July 17 event at the White House with American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials toured products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was on display alongside a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck, and a Mississippi forklift.
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to records from the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," the commander of the HMX-1 wrote to his superior, the deputy naval commander for aviation, on the eve of the event.
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. on July 17 at about 7 a.m., and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. that evening.
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was to be delayed, a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours.
The original flight crew was on the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained on the ground with the aircraft during the time.
From the records provided to TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
Data records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.
“One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case,” the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're locked up," the deputy commander replied.
The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.
But also official events have political overtones.
At the event, the president gave a boost to the health reform reform underway in the Senate, and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations.
The use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But requiring their use only for a photo op is unusual.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane was providing taxi services in the background of its first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential plane by its predecessor.
“The White House is excited about the ‘Made in America’ show — showing products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials,” said White House Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 crews frequently conduct training flights in the area around Washington and in the South Lawn to depose the U.S. president in the White House with precise centimetres.
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 practice landings at the White House.
The flight for the "Made in America" event counted in the training needs of the flight crew for the month, an official said.
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours that day for “non-presidential support missions.”
The White House said taxpayers did not take charge of any of the other props presented at the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to US Department of Defense hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Records of the unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate.
“Determining the cost to taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading,” Walters said.
“These estimates include personnel, maintenance, and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds.”
According to a 2015 RAND study, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract conclusion.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to present things that are made in America this week,” Spicer said.
“And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they are contributing to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands, of people depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for.
It is, of course, appropriate to highlight this.”
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat in the driver’s seat of a fire truck.
At the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," said the president, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss facing a tricky task
Top runners of the Second Tennis Bundesliga joins the table tennis team Suchsdorfer SV.
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will start tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the table trident Suchsdorfer SV.
Despite five games still flawless record, the top rider of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has gained a sense of reality.
Team boss Marius Zay has respect for his opponent.
"This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation.
Especially in the back positions, I think the team is very good."
For class and stability at Suchsdorfer SV, imports from the high north are the main concern.
"The Danes and Finns can even refer to Davis Cup entries.
And they are also strong in doubles," says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara (Finland), Andre G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson (Sweden), S<0xC3><0xB6>ren and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus (all Denmark).
“As always, it will be hard for us.
You also need a good portion of happiness.”
The Neuss team for the trip to the high north is practical.
His debut for Blue and White could be Maxime Janvier.
If the Frenchman who is still active in the Challenger tournament in Biella does not make it to the Bundesliga, Zdenek Kolar (Czech Republic), who plays in the tournament in Liberec, will make his first appearance this season.
The hitherto undefeated Chilean Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the Belarusian Andrei Vasilevski still at the ATP tournament in Kitzb<0xC3><0xBC>hel at the ball.
He should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp, Niels Lootsma (both Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Alster, M<0xC3><0xA1>té Valkusz could once again join the team.
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary, who was still number one in the junior world rankings in January 2016, someone from the coaching staff around Marius Zay fills the squad.
How America can harm the OMV
Indeed, Donald Trump did not seem happy when he signed into law Wednesday evening to tighten sanctions against Russia.
“In his haste to pass the law,” he quipped, Congress had packed in some “unconstitutional provisions.”
The reaction from Moscow was also as sharp as expected, and even Brussels was foaming at the US advance.
After all, the draft envisages punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU.
Accordingly, investors of the domestic OMV, which together with other European companies co-finances the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea pipeline Nord Stream 2, are concerned.
The danger is huge.
Nevertheless, it is too early for an estimate of the consequences, according to the official statement of the oil group.
In fact, Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order.
There are 12 weapons to choose from.

Narco’s Season 3 Trailer: Without Pablo Escobar, the Cali Cartel will be centre stage in Netflix’s hit series
Despite the second season of Narcos, which reveals Pablo Escobar's killer, the series of Netflix is far from over.
Seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service, the first receiving their first trailer and showing the show's latest villains.
With the third season, the DEA has turned its attention to the richest drug trafficking organization in the world: the Cali cartel.
Led by four powerful godparents, they operate “like a Fortune 500 company” only with more government bribery and violent actions.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) is their head, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) commands the Mexican connection, and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) is located in New York.
In the newly released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a, the type who invites U.S. and Colombian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs.
Other new actors are Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narcos will begin on September 1.
Roll backwards: The city hires 46 kitchen assistants
The city reorganises the Kita lunch table itself.
With fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team.
The clock is turned back in the city’s children’s day care centres.
On September 1, the city of Krefeld will take over the food supply in the urban day care facilities (kitas) again on its own.
For Sonja Pommeranz, deputy head of the Youth Aid department, this is good news: "We were all very happy".
Cooked continues to be out of the house: a caterer takes on this task and delivers freshly cooked chilled food.
The city operates 46 day care centers in the Krefeld area, in 44 the children get a warm meal at lunchtime.
Last year, 2,800 children were seated at the tables, and the need is constantly growing.
"In the meantime, not only children who are being cared for for for 45 hours a week eat lunch in the kita," Pomeranz explains.
"The offer is also valid in the 35-hour care if children stay until 2 pm."
46 Part-time workers have kitchen service from September 1st: they heat the delivered food, supplement it with salad, raw food and fruit, portion the meal individually, give out the food, clean off, rinse and clean the kitchen.
"The employees are permanently assigned to a kita," says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-group as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the amount of hours.
"The kitchen assistants are now firmly part of the kita team," says Pommeranz satisfied.
"So they are much more involved and it is easier for the Kita leadership to implement pedagogical concepts".
This is also what healthy eating and cooking is all about.
"The children are supposed to help prepare the food".
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense.
Also for the children.
"They have a known power in the kita, a person familiar to them, and not constantly changing people."
Continuity is important for children.
The cleaning of the kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out in the future by special cleaning staff.
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has, in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance, also the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in terms of cost for the city, according to the press office.
And that's despite 46 part-time workers being rehired.
"But these hours are not very important for about 750 people in the education sector," says Sonja Pommeranz.
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women, says UN
Elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, play a role, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the United Nations mission, said hundreds of women will run in provincial council elections, with three women running for the role of vice president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters being women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process.
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections will take place on April 5.
The Taliban have issued threats against an election process that coincide with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role.
This year, for the first time, elections will be peacefully handed over from one democratically elected government to the next.
Haysom said a strong role for women will further enhance Afghanistan’s democratic success.
The Afghan Independent Election Commission reports that 1.2 million women out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters are registered.

Men try to rob 13-year-old girl
Two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to rob a 13-year-old girl on Thursday.
According to police, the 13-year-old, who was staying with friends on Kolpingstra<0xC3><0x9F>e, spoke at around 1455 hours because they wanted to make phone calls with the girl’s phone.
The 13-year-old refused the request and continued with her friends.
One of the perpetrators then tried to grab the girl’s phone and necklace, but failed.
The duo escaped unscathed.
The two men were later arrested by the police.
Investigations are ongoing.
GMB concerned about investment in McVitie plant in Glasgow
A trade union would like to assure managers of Biscuit manufacturer McVitie of the long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said the company had been silent about the future of investments at the Tollcross site.
More than 500 employees work in the factory, which, among other products, produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits.
McVies owner Pladis said he has invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in recent years.
He added that employees and union representatives would “be the first to know” if their activities changed.
In a letter to the company’s head of branch, GMB Scotland urged McVitie’s to “state concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines will not be advanced.”
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said, “The fact that we can’t gain clarity from the General Site Manager about Tollcross’s business needs and investment plans for the future deeply affects our members.
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce is heavily focused on the local community and the Glasgow area, an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage.
Therefore, from the perspective of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living costs and chronic production decline, the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie.”
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The head of Tollcross's branch received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday, and the company will respond directly to it as we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and union representatives.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, where some issues were openly discussed.
We discussed with the employees that, like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our business – and this applies to all our business areas and locations – in order to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our Tollcross site, particularly in production lines and operational improvements.
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility, and should our operations change at the site, employees and their union representatives will be the first to know about it."
Did PSG Barcelona warn Neymar three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won’t back down in their pursuit of Neymar after she made an offer of <0xC2><0xA3>189 million to trigger his release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record-breaking raid?
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window this summer as the Ligue 1 club is poised to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million last season.
After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers salaries of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona are angry at the way Neymar has forced his way out, although a source close to the Catalan board insists the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this prospect by the PSG president three years ago?
When Manchester City showed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a stern warning for any club that wanted one of PSG’s best players to sign.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand in opposition to them, we will contact their players,” Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players to sign with them, it will have consequences."
Barcelona appear to have crossed this line, with the Spanish club expressing interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to leave under any circumstances, and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Neymar.
Roller overturned and damaged
On the night of Friday to Saturday, an unknown perpetrator deliberately tore down a scooter parked in the K<0xC3><0xB6>nigsfelder Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in front of the property number 30 and thus caused property damage of over 200 euros on the vehicle’s fairway.
The Schramberg police, phone 07422/ 27 01-0, asks for information.
The police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stolzenau and Leese.
Because a car met him on his lane, the driver of a VW Touran had to evade and touched the control panel.
On Thursday evening, the 34-year-old from Rehburg-Loccum was on his way with his VW at about 19.55 on the B 215 from Stolzenau coming towards Leese.
In the area around the village of Stolzenau, a car met him on his lane, so he had to turn right.
The Touran driver touched the dashboard.
The car suffered damage to property.
The driver of the incoming car, a Mercedes Benz, had overtaken a truck and continued his journey without worrying about the traffic accident.
According to the accident victim, it may be good that the Mercedes driver had not noticed the accident at all.
The police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the vehicle to contact the police station in Stolzenau under phone number 05761 / 92060.
Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger"
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the cases of abuse relieves Pope-Brother Georg Ratzinger.
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to generate discussion.
Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are the Church", explained after publication to the German Press Agency that he expects the former Bishop of Regensburg and the current Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig M<0xC3><0xBC>ller as well as the Cathedral Chapel Master Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeritus Pope Benedict.
It would be of great value to the reputation of the Catholic Church if M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regrets about their own omissions or their erroneous assessment of the proceedings at the time.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservatore Romano" however criticized that in the reporting on violence in the cathedral squares is measured with "two-dimensional".
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, no one doubts that they are "disgraceful and shameful acts" that should be punished and prevented in the future, but the "degree of media manipulation" is striking, according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia, a historian and member of the Italian National Bioethics Committee.
“The habit of describing the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider this as normal,” writes Scaraffia.
Also Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with the Bavarian Radio: "You like to go to church and this is a found food".
She also pointed out that in her youth "beats were a very normal educational tool" to "get along with naughty children like I was one".
They found it unfair to apply today’s standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.
In connection with the reports of the abuse cases, Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.
Totally wrong, says author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the memoir "My Brother the Pope" with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages).
"I have to protect Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "because all this had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report.
What exactly is the 440-page report submitted by Ulrich Weber, the lawyer appointed by the Bishop of Regensburg with the clarification?
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the early 1990s "with high plausibility" victims of assaults, 67 Domspatzen.
Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994, says in the final report: "So, in summary, it can be stated that in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R.
Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more severe.
Yet, unlike many other defendants, many victims appreciate R.’s universal humanity and, therefore, in numerous cases, despite violence, even positive memories are associated with him.”
In the interview Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieves in his opinion.
Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the "Cases of violence against protected persons at the Regensburger Domspatzen" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger.
On the one hand, many students emphasize its "humanity".
On the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist, who often became tangible when a cathedral patz did not bring a top performance musically.
How do you, as his biographer, evaluate this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you make the effort and read the entire 440-page report from front to back, you have to wonder why the name Georg Ratzinger is in it at all.
He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.
The excesses of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside its sphere of influence.
One can at best accuse him of being too late to learn about it or of not taking first hints seriously enough.
The Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all respondents as - so literally - "redemption", "heaven" and "better world".
Thus, the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent testimony, describes him as "warmhearted", "popular", "insincere", "competent" and "understood", as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and "always by children".
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to outbreaks of anger.
That he not only banged chairs and threw the keychain on the floor, but also distributed earwigs and drew too cheeky guys on his hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologizes for it.
In order to save his honour, however, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the period in question, in the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as with teachers.
Do you also know such methods of punishment?
Of course, I think every one of us who was born before 1968.
I also experienced this in a secular school, a state high school.
Compared to what this report is actually about, namely the appalling sexual abuse and excesses of violence in preschool, these are, of course, trivial matters.
One wonders if it is not more about his fame and his role as the brother of Benedict XVI, that many media just fell on him.
The Bavarian Pope is still being worked on by many who have never understood him.
But the truth is: the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every way!
In the media, much has been reported in connection with the report on the topic of abuse at the Regensburg Cathedral Palaces.
Is Georg Ratzinger also charged with any involvement or cognizance with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?
Michael Hesemann: Definitely not.
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have trusted the cathedral chapel master.
Not even the parents were invited.
"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it," one affected person told the others, "it was all very embarrassing to me."
The real problem in educating about sexual abuse was, and still is, that most victims are silent out of shame.
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not to a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in some way professionally.
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger’s role in relation to abuse cases?
Michael Hesemann: A student who was interviewed put it this way: "Regarding sexual abuse ... I don't see ... a case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator.
I find it ... also really absurd to assume that he is the only one ... sons have opened up more intrusively or more clearly or even rather than to their parents, interns, trust teachers, etc.
“Talking to him about sex is unthinkable.”
Thus, the report comes to the very clear result: "The fact that the affected students and/or their environment entrusted themselves to him in advance could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation".
As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore exempt from any cognizance.
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented or brought to the notice.
Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these heinous crimes, as unfortunately happened in some cases.
In the media, much of the "excess of violence" was read at the Regensburg cathedral squares.
The former cathedral chapel master Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report "Wegschauen".
Does he have to live with this accusation?
Michael Hesemann: That’s the big problem, that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere, in the middle, Georg Ratzinger.
This, in turn, is an abuse of the report.
There is a clear separation: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and excesses of violence, as well as, let’s say, other accusations.
In addition, the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir director of the Domspatzen.
The whole terrible beating pedagogy, the cases in which boys were outright harassed and abused by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly, all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.
But Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got to see the boys when they were already in Domspatzengymnasium.
On that, as the vast majority of witnesses emphasize, the topic of "preschool" was taboo.
You were just happy to have escaped her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" conditions.
What was different about Domspatzengymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was discipline, but not sadistic violence.
This is also true of Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that "many victims appreciated the universal humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence, even positive memories are associated with him".
At the very least, it remains the accusation of having looked away.
However, despite all efforts, the report was only able to define two periods in which he was told about the conditions at the preschool.
The first time in 1970/71, when he was just starting to establish himself and from the proceedings at a school where he just did not act and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears to the conditions?
Michael Hesemann: No, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium, which the report even reproduces.
In it, he points out that "the punishment of beatings will continue to be practiced in preschool".
Even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action.
This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed, when beatings were long banned in Bavaria as well.
Before that, they happened in a legal grey area, as we all probably know.
It was also difficult for him to estimate where those affected might have been exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded.
I can’t say he always looked away.
That's just not true.
It was not until 1980 that the punishment of beatings in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.
Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today’s educational standards to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We historians are talking about the "fall trick of anachronism", that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards.
The princess is right.
But this does not apply, of course, to sexual abuse, which was abhorrent at all times, nor to what was violated in the preschool by contradictions and violence against innocent children’s souls, it goes far beyond what was customary at the time.
It’s all terrible and I’m glad it’s finally being worked on.
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His means of disciplining and punishing, i.e., pulling earplugs and pulling on the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical punishment was then prohibited, he also strictly adhered to it.
What picture of his time in Regensburg did Georg Ratzinger portray in the conversations with you for the book "My Brother the Pope"?
Did the subject of punishment also come up?
Michael Hesemann: Well, the book is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI., tells from his perspective that the cathedral palaces played only a minor role.
Nevertheless, I do not deny that he led a strict regiment there.
But this must also be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand for absolute discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world rank out of the nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition, who toured twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988).
With biscuits and sweets alone, you don’t make great singers out of rebellious boys and face every success, no matter what the field, but always discipline, passion and self-conquering.
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger talking about his book?
Michael Hesemann: Through the work on the book and beyond, I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced him as a wonderful, humorous, basic, deeply religious and good-hearted person, from whom one cannot imagine that he could hurt even a fly.
I regularly get to know how many former Domspatzen still do today, 23 years after his retirement, regularly keep in touch with him, visit him, read to him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.
Those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strict with them, are therefore clearly in the minority.
Most cathedrals are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music.
And that he was always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, of course, that may be - but he was also a lovely person of respect, whom they still look up to today and who almost adore them.
And please, once again quite clearly: all he is accused of are methods of education that were on the agenda at the time.
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago.
But it is highly unfair to make a man a media scapegoat just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother.
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious.
Because the report that has just been published relieves him.
Now it would be a good thing to leave a 93-year-old man who has earned a lot of money and who would not have known the Regensburg cathedral squares without it outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany.
