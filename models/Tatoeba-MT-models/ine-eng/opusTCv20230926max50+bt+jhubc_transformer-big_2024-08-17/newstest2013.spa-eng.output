A Republican Strategy to Obstacle Obama’s Re-Election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight electoral fraud.
The Brennan Center considers the latter a myth and claims that voter fraud is less frequent in the United States than the number of people who die from lightning strikes.
In fact, Republican lawyers have found no more than 300 cases of election fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In that sense, these measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Contrary to what happens in Canada, American states are responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
And in the same vein, a majority of American governments enacted, as of 2009, new laws that made the registration or voting process difficult.
This phenomenon has spread after the November 2010 elections, which saw the rise of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 that restricted the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity document with a photograph, in addition to a proof of U.S. citizenship.
On the other hand, these laws reduce early voting periods, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of scrutiny and withdraw their right to vote from citizens with criminal records.
Prior to the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present a photo ID.
The State of Indiana was the first to demand it.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana law in 2008.
That is why the Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
In recent years, these authorities have supported bills in 34 states to force voters to present a photo ID.
It is important to note that, contrary to what is happening in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the Social Security card.
In fact, 11 percent of U.S. citizens—that is, 21 million people of voting age—do not have any photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
On the other hand, five million new voters in 2012 lack an identity document with those characteristics.
But, often, obtaining the required identity document costs more than a hundred dollars.
As a result, the new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people with low incomes.
Indeed, 25 per cent of African-Americans, 15 per cent of people earning less than $35,000 a year, 18 per cent of citizens over 65, and 20 per cent of voters between 18 and 29 do not have a photo ID.
And there's more.
In many states students, the voters who vote the most for Democratic candidates, cannot use the photo ID issued by their institution.
On the other hand, those same states authorize members of fishing or hunting clubs who usually vote for Republican parties to use documents issued by those clubs.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures clearly seek to limit the Hispanic vote.
It appears that two out of three Hispanic voters support the Democratic Party.
On the other hand, Republican lawmakers in 2011 supported certain laws that abolished voter registration on the same day of scrutiny in eight states.
In addition, they limited the right of individuals and groups to create a help service for voters who would like to register.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to the registration of some 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have brought the registration rate of new electors down in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers passed laws in five other states favoring the reduction of the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 election in Florida, 33 percent of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter represented only 13 percent of the state’s voters.
In the case of Hispanics, exactly the same thing happened.
These represent no more than 11% of the electorate, which is equivalent to 24% of the citizens who vote in advance.
However, whites, who represent 76% of the electorate, represent only 46% of the citizens who vote in advance.
Of course, Democratic lawmakers and their supporters have fervently opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration.
In this regard, Democratic governors have blocked several bills.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
In part, the damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states passed the law requiring the filing of an identity document with a photograph.
However, it is undeniable that the new rules adopted will complicate the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been voted on, as it is clear that they are intended to influence the 2012 results in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Center report shows that states that have passed such laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to achieve the presidency.
It is too early to say with certainty whether these electoral system-wide legislative changes will have a significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential election.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will adversely affect the participation rate.
In this sense, the measures will partly undermine the American democratic system.
Prostate Cancer Screening: Getting Tested or Not Getting Tested?
Indeed, the PSA test sometimes presents erroneous results, with false negative results or even false positive results, after which it is decided to perform useless medical interventions.
It is more than enough reason to make men, already reluctant in themselves, doubt whether or not screening tests should be done.
To take the test or not?
We asked for advice from two experts.
Studies in the United States have detected a high rate of contagion among the sample groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make firm recommendations.
For its part, the European study showed a certain difference in mortality between patients who had been screened and those who did not.
The study, with a follow-up at 12 years, also showed that there is between 30 and 40% chance of metastasis if the detection test has not been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40 if your father has suffered from prostate cancer.
Men of African American origin have a higher risk index.
The key is to make a good decision once the cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolent.
It is really necessary to get the patient to understand the degree of risk of his cancer. He should be offered all possible options and not necessarily treat prostate cancers that do not attack long-term life, in which case it is better to opt for active surveillance of the disease.
Today many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated, since such cancer is not aggressive or carries a risk to their life.
Instead, we suggest active surveillance of the disease and, if it progresses, we offer treatment.
We increasingly determine precise criteria for deciding who should or should not be treated.
I recommend that the test be done in any case.
But it is important that you talk to your doctor to determine whether the test should be done or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Society of Urology, a tool that allows to evaluate the pros and cons of the PSA test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe for preventing cancer.
Despite the progress of research, adopting healthy lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risks of disease.
We estimated that if everyone ate well and moved enough, 30% of cancers could be prevented.
“If no one smoked, that rate would rise to at least 50%,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
In contrast, we estimate that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Many others remain totally inexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Tobacco is linked to 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for other types of cancer.
It greatly harms people’s health.
“Today, there are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
A hopeful fact: 10 years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
The Weight
Fat and obesity also favor the onset of the disease, according to the SCC.
They increase the risks of breast, colon and rectal cancer, esophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
“Research shows that regular lifelong physical activity protects against breast cancer,” they add.
The food
The body also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
In large quantities, they scale up the risks of suffering from colorectal cancer.
Meat products should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat for smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of cancerous substances.
“They can damage the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” they explain.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitamin complexes and cancer.
However, at the moment their investigations are inconclusive.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one of them showed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, in another one what was observed was, rather, an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly determined.
On the other hand, M. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about everyone’s concerns and family history with their doctor.
"Doing the screening test doesn't cause cancer."
The Higgs boson in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson generated a great shock last summer, and rightly so.
It is believed, in fact, that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing more and nothing less.
And what is more, it is the particle whose existence predicted the standard model: our best or "less bad" explanation of the nature and behavior of matter, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But it is not entirely clear to physicists that this is Higgs.
We know without a doubt that there is a new particle and that it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, new data unveiled this week at a major physics congress held in Kyoto seems to confirm that it is, although more data is still missing to be completely safe.
In any case, we assume that this is Higgs, as the chances of making a mistake seem small. We will see what it is about.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and inescapable law which implies that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to break that rule and don’t try too hard, because it will end up getting hurt.
Although particle physics is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: Pauli's exclusion principle, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state"; a "state" that consists, roughly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicists classify particles into two categories.
On the one hand we find the good citizens called fermions, who wisely obey Pauli’s principle.
And on the other side are the bosons, a dirty panda of anarchists who have no respect for anything, or at least not for this principle, which means they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the Berkeley Particle Adventure website that, by the way, is extraordinary, the bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we will not talk about here, and the "force particles", by which the great forces of nature propagate and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
These bosons, I should point out here, are not the exotic animals we could believe.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson: the photon or "particle of light" that acts as a "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
Indeed, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it “disorders” the electromagnetic field in that precise environment; a bit like when we throw a stone into a pond.
In this "disorder" an electromagnetic wave (of light, infrared, ultraviolet, etc.) is born, and this wave is nothing but a photon; that is, one of the "force-carrying" bosons.
More stable field
The same thing happens with the Higgs boson, with the difference that it is another field, the Higgs field, that needs to be "disordered" for this boson to appear.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field. To activate it you need to reach extremely high energies, a bit as if it were an ice pond in which only a thick rock could slide over the surface.
That’s why it takes an immense particle accelerator like CERN’s (the big hadron collider is a ring 27 km in circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others do not: a piece of paper, for example, will never stand by itself stuck to the door of a refrigerator.
And in the same way, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have a mass, while the rest (such as the photon, by the way), do not.
Now, what can all these investigations "contribute" to?, asks Mrs Plamondon.
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physicists to screen for differences between observations and predictions of MS.
On the other hand, many fervently wish to be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" that plugs certain holes in the model.
This, it must be said, still has enormous shortcomings, as it does not propose any explanation relating to gravity (ups!) or to dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the Universe (another ups!).
But we have not found such differences at CERN so far.
Repercussions
The repercussions of such research on our day-to-day lives are hard to predict, but we don’t think we’re wrong to say it won’t have any.
For you to see: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of lasers in laboratories did not suspect at all the revolution that their work would provoke.
They interfered with scientific applications, but nothing more.
In fact, as physicist Willard Boyle, who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962, said at first the laser was rather considered a "laboratory apparatus".
Imagine...
And in addition, applications can also come from all the instrumentation surrounding research.
For example, Willard Boyle himself developed a light sensor in 1969 in the course of his research on optics.
Although it was not his original intention at all, this sensor now serves as an "eye" for all digital devices in the world, which earned him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
That does not mean, of course, that the activities of the LHC necessarily want to transform our lives, but that we never know...
Palliative care. The best way to die... <0x7C> Le Devoir
In his Commission to Die in Dignity, Quebec recently debated the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate should resume soon while a bill is being prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to do.
Le Devoir tried to see it up close.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. lived alone in his Montérégie apartment.
The prostate cancer that was destroying him had given him a two-year respite.
"I had been given five years to live, but I've already been like this for seven years," he says, making a pass, lying in his bed in the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center of Beloeil, which he arrived the day before.
“But it’s always a shock, we can’t be prepared for this,” he continues.
The disease has wreaked havoc on him: a huge weakness that prevents him from going to the bathroom alone and even eating alone.
Sitting in front of an appetizing lunch, he accepts resignation to help him eat.
Brave, he even smiles, talks to strangers who pay attention to him, bring him medicine and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My biggest wish is that they cure my diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for that evil.
“In the course of our lives we learn that a man stands on his feet,” says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at the Victor-Gadbois center.
Returning to your childhood, for certain people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“That depends on the person’s ability to accept that regression,” he says.
Because, in the opinion of most people who work in palliative care, great moments take place at the very heart of that regression.
All patients entering the Victor-Gadbois palliative care center suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
In that state, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer offer “curative” care.
The 89-year-old Mrs. A.’s greatest fear is dying “consciously and drowned.”
But the disease has made him discover his children.
“I have good children,” he adds.
“I don’t have any more desires left in this life,” she says, before agreeing to be put on a mask to help her breathe.
And wait, in the next few days, one last visit from your son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois is offered, with a group of volunteers, body care and food aid.
They are palliative care given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help make your death more comfortable.
In Quebec we have a palliative care bed for every 11,700 inhabitants.
It is very little, as we know that we will all end up dying someday.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the center.
Whether at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying are offered mouthwashes with brandy or Pepsi, according to demand.
Diabetics are no longer controlled by their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr. X, who died in the course of the night.
This morning, his son finished the beer at the feet of the deceased.
“We help both patients and their loved ones,” says Nathalie Savard, director of care.
In the center Victor-Gadbois the days pass without ever being the same.
Next to a 94-year-old man who savors his last family gathering in the courtyard, well placed between his pillows while everyone drinks to his health, a 36-year-old dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two children, after trying everything to survive.
“For the past six months, there have always been three to five beds occupied by people under the age of 45 with cancer,” says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadboisarrivent center come from their home and 47% from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate suffering when a patient reaches the terminal phase of their life, whether at home, in the hospital or in a care center.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois Center and the Grand Montréal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize almost exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this great relative lack of health care in Quebec that causes many doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto signed by eminences of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, has been circulating to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system in Quebec is not competent enough to ensure that anyone is entitled to quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
“Recently,” she relates, “I’ve seen a patient spend 14 days in Emergencies suffering great pains without having done the necessary to relieve it.
I’m afraid patients want to die just because they don’t get the right care.”
And in parallel, many oncologists persist with their patients until the last day, despite the worst prognosis.
Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Richard’s hopes of survival were already low when she left a grueling chemotherapy treatment.
“When I told my oncologist that I wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that she was very sorry that I wanted to stop fighting,” she says.
"But she had told me there was nothing else to do!"
There is no almighty care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who request to die thank their caregivers for not having served them in their demands once their pain has been alleviated thanks to a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in terms of pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at home at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the end of life, doctors usually resort to palliative sedation, which serves to sleep the patient until the moment of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
We can't pretend that we don't understand that part of the suffering.
Increasingly, the unrelieved disease will have the possibility of having that palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved all say the same thing: “I want to die.”
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want euthanasia,” but “I want you to relieve me.”
This report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Widespread Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road network, entrepreneurs of the BTP, fundraisers of political parties and specialists of the Italian mafia tell, day by day, what they know of a formidable "system", of which are part of the construction industry, officials, politicians, trade unionists and mafias.
An "industry" that was too expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It’s curious how the system is pulverized once we’ve hunted down the mainstream media,” Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec lawmaker and former Montreal police chief, said in a statement.
He led the outbreak of the scandal in 2011, which was made possible by an in-depth investigation into misappropriations linked to road contracts in Quebec, which then-liberal Prime Minister Jean Charest had agreed to delay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, clandestine party funding and corruption among officials.
“Since the start of the investigation in 2010, only the Ministry of Transport would have saved a billion dollars in contracts,” containing some of its instincts to keep a proportionate share.
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors", he adds, while hoping to be able to "show the stratagems behind the individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit, created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, created in 2011, also applies with its team of government interventionists, researchers and analysts.
This unit works in addition to the “Marteau Squad” police, who, since 2009, have made Montreal’s “sewer cartel” moderate when it comes to inflating contracts.
In recent weeks, the unit has proceeded to the serial registration of allegations of fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a city on the outskirts.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his position as mayor of Laval, Quebec’s third-largest city.
It is suspected that repeated bribes have been pocketed in exchange for public contracts.
He has been formally charged with engineers from Montreal’s road network and Italian-born entrepreneurs such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambiato.
The latter has caused shock by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the "system" of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for three years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-linked middleman who transferred the money to Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Zambito distributed money to the right and to the left during the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals in power.
He also admitted to organizing an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal Deputy Prime Minister Nathalie Normandeau.
Inflation of the cost of sewerage contracts
In Montreal, the “system” of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public works engineer, explained this perfectly to the commission: in ten years he received gifts, travel invitations, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and bribes from construction companies for a total of 736,000 dollars, all in exchange for sewerage contracts whose costs he inflated.
Other road network officials have admitted that they received money for inflating the bills between 30% and 40% in terms of fake extras.
In addition, an organizer of the mayor’s party, Martin Dumont, accused Tremblay of deliberately turning a blind eye to a parallel budget and filled his chests with dirty money.
In the wake of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November and led to a huge crisis in Montreal.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected politicians in Montreal to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivi<0xC3><0xA8>re-des-Prairies district in the east of the island, she opposed since 2010 the sale of a municipal land acquired for 5 million dollars and resold for 1.6 million to developers in the midst of a real estate boom.
70% of election campaign money was dirty money
From the research that will finally be carried out, she says she pulls "from a thread to be able to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by ants, to stop gangrene and catch the culprits."
He added that the process is “painful, but positive.”
We are cleaning up the wounds but we would need a clean research unit in Montreal and be very vigilant so that dubious practices do not repeat themselves.
How to do the cleaning.
Regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, states that "officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars", but is concerned above all about the role of the "elected politicians in the wake of the stratagem".
Estimating at 70% the proportion of dirty money that was destined for the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he is ironic: “I have been told that this is nothing more than a pale reflection of reality.”
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to $100 per party, but that won’t change the donation, he said, “as long as election expenses aren’t strictly limited, there will be dirty money in politics.”
He calls for a complete overhaul of the system of awarding public contracts and financing parties: “we cannot fall lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow us to rebuild the house with a stronger foundation, with more controls and laws.”
If this story tarnishes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Duchesneau invites those who laugh to look in the mirror.
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season he has acquired a new entity with PSG.
How would you explain that advance?
It could be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Day by day I am at your side.
The technical staff has also contributed a lot to me.
And those elements push me every day to raise the level of my game.
In a game, that’s easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I don't get hung up.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine pre-formation centre to my passage through Saint-Etienne, I have always made great strides.
He will benefit from the competition recruited by Carlo Ancelotti.
This summer’s recruits are used to playing very high-level matches.
They know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to fight and give it everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my positioning.
It’s backed by adjuncts like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man who needed the equipment?
Of course not.
Ancelotti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no one like him in League 1 and he is among the best European coaches.
He has a great experience and has won numerous titles with the best clubs.
He has worked with great players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January I had a very comforting conversation with him.
I had just come out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he has in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about PSG in the first half of the season?
In League 1, Lyon has stripped us of our leadership position.
But we're still in the ambush.
One of our biggest goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the finals in style.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything can happen.
But we have a lot to say in front of many very good European teams.
We want, to start, to finish the first of our league against Porto to be able to receive the round of eight finals.
Can PSG become a great European club in the short term?
You already have the budget...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and be there in the long run.
Today, that is not the case.
At the economic level, PSG is committed to its means for this project to become a reality.
Not winning the Cup in League 1, as in the last season, would it be a big failure?
Of course, it would be a big disappointment.
This year we will invest all our efforts to bring us that title of champions.
Last season we didn’t get far.
In May we got a disappointment, as we had the optimal conditions to finish first.
We had a strong season.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, with 79 points we should have been champions...
But another team, Montpellier, had a much better season.
This year I think it will be good.
Even if big teams like Marseille, Lyon and Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the weapons to take it.
Do you think the media expects more from PSG?
It is normal for them to expect a lot from us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We have totally accepted it.
After we won 4-0 at home to Troyes, who still find things to reproach us is a bit frustrating.
We wonder what more people expect.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to launch a game project.
A team is built over time.
In the Champions League we have shown that we can respond and be present.
Look at Manchester City who, after two seasons, have not managed to qualify for the final eight, and they have also invested a lot!
In view of the sums invested, we would imagine you with 15 points advantage to the day.
That would be neglecting our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the previous season, have been "driven" by this new PSG.
That shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we can say with a smile that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended up taking the trophy.
PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s successes.
Let's say we have a "Golden Independence."
That means Ibrahimovic is very competent and scores a lot of goals.
He's here to prove he's the star of League One.
And he has proven in every team he has gone through that he is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects the men he has around him.
What he has done is truly exceptional.
That pushes others to increase their level of play.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all to progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French team?
It's been a disappointment.
I was very excited to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from accumulating play time.
I saw things there and came out reinforced.
Today I manage to play good matches in the selection.
That's what I've been waiting for since my baptism with the blues.
We learned the lesson of what happened in Ukraine and that is why today we have an exemplary behavior.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps’ first month at the helm of the “bleus”?
He's getting results.
They are well placed in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The coach is rigorous, close to the players and inspires to win.
As was the case with Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
Blanc achieved his goal of qualifying for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the team to Brazil.
Did the draw (1-1) on 16 October in Spain serve to lay the groundwork?
That game gave me confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before that shock in Spain, I had not experienced a similar game in my entire career.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
Quite the opposite to current money exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing charges between the parties.
In addition, as often happens in technologies, the political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency convertible to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure exchange protocol in the manner of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files equal to equal.
Nearly 200,000 transactions have been recorded thanks to 15,000 computers on the network.
And about a thousand websites accept bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching the top of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2 five months later, before returning today to around $10 (the quotes are censored on the bitcoincharts.com page).
It’s nothing impressive when compared to global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) took an interest in him in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It described bitcoin as “the most successful virtual currency,” “competing with the dollar or the euro,” and “similar to conventional currencies.”
Bitcoin differs from other systems with virtual currency types such as “credits”, used to advance in a video game and which can be earned by playing or purchased (and even sometimes redeemed).
The social network Facebook also developed this type of system.
But in every exchange a central authority controls and treats the changes.
With bitcoin, all network nodes are both bookholders, verifiers, currency issuers and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users is actually made between two electronic addresses in the form of email.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, thus guaranteeing anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically through a double-key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that bitcoin changes are contained in the public ledger, which is disseminated throughout the network.
The key milestone is to write that new transaction in that book.
This goes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to the computers and the winner, a kind of provisional central banker, will have the privilege of adding that complementary line.
This is a phase of file shredding, i.e. transformation of a large file into a shorter and unique numeric footprint.
Computers "pick up" the new transaction and add a number before "crushing" the set.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular footprint (plus zeros at the beginning).
Once that number is found, the other nodes easily verify that it is the good one.
The transaction is then indestructibly linked to the chain of sets of the other transactions; any modification would change the footprint.
If, to commit a fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as valid one of the two transactions; the other would remain orphaned, since both have different footprints.
The computer that solves the challenge takes 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, that reward is divided into two regularly, most likely before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to one hundred millionth, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also revealed in each increase in computing power.
The life of the network already has its ups and downs.
Websites that offer services for Bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposit have been stolen.
“The failure used does not affect the same protocol,” said Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real currency payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money laundering thanks to this anonymous service.
But cash has the same defect.
Weighty actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the ledger and showed that about 80% of bitcoins do not circulate.
In November, the "giant rebates" were launched.
“30,000 dollars were exchanged,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, which turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, author of a pedagogical book on that coin, believes quite a bit in the potential of this technology in addition to in the transaction network.
Its system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which come out cheaper.
The bearer also manages their identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system is easy to set up in stores, which do not have to install new terminals or software.
Just provide them with an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who claims to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of revision of hierarchical systems by more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to impose itself, but in 2013 there could be a change,” he predicts.
On the other hand, in its report the ECB intends to reassess the various risks, now considered high, in case this currency succeeds.
We're out of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the Americans must leave by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
We have punished above all the Afghan peasants, whom we have considered terrorists.
And to ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, plus the wounded and the mutilated.
The Taliban have foreign extremists and former refugee chiefs in Pakistan, but often also peasants who reject the presence of the foreign army, as in Soviet times.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and archaic, even if their causes are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks or Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes even aided by local insurgents, these will no longer be tolerated when Westerners become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the base of Nijrab, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to the French credits, was done by order.
The convoys of trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack, guarded by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban inflow into Kabul from the end of 2014.
Circumstances have changed since its irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul was then empty and the country engulfed in fire and blood because of fighting between different factions.
Their takeover of the country had been perceived as a kind of liberation, the return to security.
Afghans have paid the price for the obscurantism of their peasants overtaken by the al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is no better today.
The old Mujahideen, the current government and the current Taliban share the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making government land to resell as solar for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge US subcontracts.
They are discredited; most of them have not fought.
People, as I have heard in the countryside, aspire to a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as will those who have taken advantage of American generosity: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are tired of war and their ideologies.
They have lived the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated its advantages.
With about 65% of its population under the age of 25, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In cities, state schools are full of both girls and boys.
It will be necessary to give work to those young people who will not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opposition, is eager for mobile phones. TV and its Turkish leaflets presenting a modern world has great admirers all over the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities who want to lead the country be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already concerned with reconstituting the provincial militias, which will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, a country of mountains with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization in the image of Western nations; however, the United States has wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidential power, by abolishing the post of prime minister that existed since the 1964 Constitution.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, particularly in the run-up to the April 2014 elections.
However, their country has depended on foreign aid since the 1950s and even before that.
No industry has re-established its services, no reservoirs have been repaired, and no major irrigation systems have been repaired.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country ruined after 30 years of war, government control would have been necessary.
Rumors spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral wealth.
And that only increased the feeling that Westerners were there to take over them.
With no energy to extract iron or copper ores from the ground and no means of transport to export them through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost abandoned the Mes Aynak copper mines, leaving international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) to excavate the immense Buddhist site and remain there as the most important employers in the province.
Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are heavily dependent, will also need to re-establish normal relations.
The French troops left on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: schools for girls, schools for boys, a French department at the university, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, health and agricultural fields and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, in order to try to "win hearts and spirits" and to carry out the impossible task of making aid and offensive actions coincide, a service of "civil and military actions" of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), suppressed in 2012, brought and brought through a small French NGO numerous works of collective interest and actions.
Those works, delicious to get local labor, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, sun protection and increased crop areas.
What will we leave as a memory after two million euros of military spending?
A rather modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, very harsh in those valleys often located more than 2,000 meters high.
The Embassy received dozens of written demands with small agricultural proposals made by local communities in Kapisa province.
In order to free them from the insurgency carried out by the foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me they want, it would be necessary to maintain a small, well-controlled civilian aid that reaches them directly.
A Constitution with Forceps in Egypt
It is a new double or nothing from President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever in terms of the constitutional declaration, which provisionally grants it full powers, he decided to play it all over.
He took everyone by surprise on Wednesday when he announced that the Constituent Assembly would vote on his final text the next day.
Only a week ago, the Head of State had given the Assembly two more months to finish its work.
And almost two years ago Egypt used a provisional text, several times modified, which weakens institutional stability and leads to judicial entanglements.
This new initiative has only increased the fracture in the country.
For his opponents, the president perseveres in his “autocratic delirium” and continues “traitoring his word” and “squeezing the law.”
On the part of its supporters, it ensures that this is a measure to end the institutional and political crisis faster and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held in the next 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their project of explaining the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the president, it is also a way to regain popular and democratic legitimacy while the controversy wreaks havoc across the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote for him, as he said in an interview with the American weekly Time.
Considering that this appeal has been voted on very quickly, it contains an ultimatum for the Egyptian people: "either they vote my text or I keep the powers full", powers that will supposedly come to an end with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in that strange environment in which 85 members of this largely Islamist Constituent Assembly voted the text yesterday.
Most of the Liberals did not attend the call.
By mid-November, shortly before the constitutional declaration, they had closed the door because they felt they could not assert their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quorum, 11 people, substitute members, were added yesterday morning in haste.
Some of them are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
As you would expect, the articles voted on have been unanimous.
On the other hand, it is funny to the commentators that one of the few discrepancies of the day has been expressed practically at the time of prayer, so much so that several members of the committee came to think that the watch of the Constituent Assembly was wrong.
The text, which was still being voted on yesterday, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which is the subject of all considerations, remains finally identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, which stipulated that "the principles of Sharia constitute the principal source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is a fundamental demand, hoped that “principles” could be replaced by “rules,” which would have allowed for stricter enforcement.
For Islamists, that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of Egyptian society.
Liberals call it hypocrisy and consider it to be nothing more than an advertising stunt.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They refer, in particular, to article 220, which confers on Al-Azhar University an advisory role, in particular for anyone who has to confirm its conformity with the laws of Sharia.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, it is disturbing because "people called to speak are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
Here we glimpse the premises of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are further heightened by the fact that the next rector of the university would be much less moderate than the current one.
"For now, there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution we are within the framework of the marital status.
Most of the jurists who have been working on that text are not ulemas but university students, some of them trained in the French system,” explains Alexis Blouet, who is preparing a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges that there may be some ambiguity around article 220, as the terms used mimic religious vocabulary.
"We refer specifically to the term iqh [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could be raised in the future would be to what extent are the competent civil judges to rule above all this?"
Beyond its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticisms that refer to the extended powers it confers on the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood will claim to be few compared to those who were during the previous regime.
Another conflicting point: the powers conferred on the army.
According to the will of the military, the revision of the defense budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a national defense council.
The prosecution of civilians in military courts, as called for by human rights associations, will also not be prohibited.
They also expressed their concerns about the text, which they consider libertarian.
The crime of blasphemy remains and, from now on, insults are prohibited, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially that of the press.
In addition, no article emphasizes the protection of women, emphasizes Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive thing has been the prohibition of torture in accordance with article 36.
The word did not appear in the previous Constitution.
Although the Egyptian president was due to appear on television last night, demonstrations are expected for this noon.
Supporters of the head of state protested on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists are waiting for the holy land, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the majesty of biblical truths with modern comfort and pristine nature.
“AIF” identified the five most important reasons why one should visit Israel.
Reverence in the Holy Land
It is worth visiting the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is believed that anyone who enters this "baptismal pile" will receive divine grace.
And Galilee, the place of the miracles of Jesus: the conversion of water into wine at the wedding, walking on the waters, the calming of the storm and the crowded nets.
In this very place, Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
But the greatest number of holy places are found in Jerusalem.
Believers here walk the Viacrucis or the Way of the Cross of Jesus (in Latin "V<0xC3><0xAD>a Dolorosa").
It begins in the Fortress of Antonio, the Praetorium, where the trial took place, and continues through the streets of the Old City, goes to the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, the place of the crucifixion, to the Stone of the Anointing and to the burial place of Jesus.
In this same place there is also the symbolic Christian Omblig of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of humanity.
And the monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem, built in the place where, according to a Christian legend, there was a tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus.
In Jerusalem there is also the most sacred place for Jews, the Wall of Lamentations; the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
As is tradition, people of different religions leave here notes with their wishes, which will later become reality.
Take a vertical journey
The ruins of the Masada Fortress were what remained of a secret refuge against the enemies, which Herod the Great ordered to build in the year 25 BC for his family.
They are located on the mountain cliffs at a height of 450 m above sea level.
And get there by your own means, only those who are dedicated to climbing can.
Others can reach this historic summit on the funicular.
And in the north of the country at an altitude of 1600-2040 m is the famous ski resort Hermon, where in the winter months there is a large influx of tourists.
There, bus services are offered from the foot of the hill.
The total length of the ski slopes is 45 km.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on top of the mountain.
Visiting unique museums
There are about 300 museums in this country.
In a single trip you will not be able to visit all of them.
But it is worth visiting at least five of them, the most interesting.
Among them is the Israel Museum, located near the Knesset (Israeli Parliament).
In it are preserved the ancient Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in the caves of the Judean desert, and about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological pieces.
It is worth visiting the Museum of Art in Tel Aviv.
In his painting exhibition he has paintings by Impressionists and Expressionists such as Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall or Picasso.
In Acre you can visit the museum-bathroom Al Basha, which are some rooms of ancient Turkish baths with model figures of visitors and bathers of that time.
In Caesarea it is worth passing by the exclusive Ralli private museum, where you can admire the sculptures of Rodin and Dal<0xC3><0xAD>.
There are no tourist guides or souvenir shops there.
Admission is free, and donations are categorically not accepted.
The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages in history.
The most tragic section is the Children’s Memorial, built in memory of the 1.5 million children killed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
You go into it and you find yourself in complete darkness.
The stars are shining.
And they sound the names of the Jewish children and the names of the countries in which they lost their lives.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health
The three main tourist areas of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
In each of them there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanographic museums.
It is curious that in the Red Sea they bathe even in the winter months, as the water temperature does not drop from 21 degrees and the air warms up to 23 degrees.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and there they bathe all year round.
By the way, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is located at the lowest point on the planet: 417 m below sea level.
The blue waters there are a brine that easily hold even those who can’t swim.
The surrounding landscapes are truly beautiful.
People come here to go through salt water, brine and healing mud treatment courses and strengthen their health in cases of dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to put their broken nerves in order.
Touching the Mysteries of Antiquity
It preserves the ancient part of Tel Aviv, the citadel of Jaffa, on the Mediterranean coast.
Through it passed the famous sea route that united Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to legend, it was here that Noah built his ark and Perseus rescued the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this same place, he led a long and happy life.
Tourists love to stroll through the narrow streets that bear the names of the signs of the Zodiac.
They say that if you touch the walls in the street of your "same" symbol, the fortune will be favorable to you.
In Jaffa you can find couples of newlyweds who come from all over Israel, and even from other countries to take pictures.
And in Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can walk through the Roman theater, "taking" the fortress of the crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurators, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre is now used for night concerts and opera performances.
Tourists remember
If you travel to Israel, don’t worry if your English leaves much to be desired: in this country about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to be carried in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily exchanged for shekels (currently 1-3$,8 shekels).
Urban transport is mainly composed of buses, but in Jerusalem there is a fast tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country, which consists of six stations and connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
Actually, it's from an underground funicular.
Travel on any type of public transport costs 6 shekels and for this price you can travel by transshipment for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays.
From Friday night to Saturday sunset, markets and shops close and public transport stops its work.
But on Sunday morning a new work week begins.
In many cafes, restaurants and hotels only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, shellfish, unshelled fish and dishes in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of dishes based on beef and lamb, soups and desserts prepared with coconut milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, a wide variety of sauces, falafel, which are balls of ground chickpeas, fruits and vegetables.
There are no street dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
Instead, there are many well-fed cats that “walk to their liking” in an imposing way.
At night you can see them sleeping even on the roofs of parked cars.
The ruminants love crowded places and do not reject sweets.
Renting a car, depending on the brand, will cost from $37 (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80) per day.
In addition to the insurance, which comes out for $15 a day.
And renting a bike will pay you for 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Israel in numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of those who came to visit the country and rest were citizens of the USA, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and Ukraine.
The Promised Land, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists, an amount that exceeds by 51% the same index of 2010, before the cancellation of the visa regime on February 9, 2011.
"The big and powerful" will take you to Moscow: immigrants save for the language
As lawmakers and human rights defenders discuss the consequences of the mandatory review law, scammers who trade in “false” certificates have already appeared in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers arrive in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities of Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asian countries: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to help their families who have stayed home.
Since December 1, a law has come into force, according to which every labor immigrant must take an examination to check his knowledge of the Russian language.
For now, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the service provision sector, community service institutions, domestic services and retail trade.
However, over time, as promised by the Federal Immigration Service, exams will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, it will not be enough to pass the examination of the language, if not also that of Russian history and the fundamentals of the legislation.
Knowledge of the language must be confirmed even to receive and renew the work permit.
The exception is citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
Persons who managed to obtain their certificates of education and diplomas before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 shall not be subject to this law.
Usefulness, fatality and defence of rights
The network of examination centers will operate under the auspices of the Pushkin Russian Language Institute, the People’s Friendship University, Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian higher education institutions.
Immigrants will be able to take the test in all cities, right now in Russia more than 160 centers of this type are open.
The initiative on the introduction of the exam was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Immigration Service.
But rights advocates, long before the law came into force, often managed to ask the press this question: And what will this actually bring?
What changes will the mandatory knowledge of the language bring, both for Russians and for immigrants themselves?
First of all, the representatives of the Immigration Service answer, this will reduce the number of people suffering "labor slavery".
Many people today talk about defending the rights of labor migrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Federal Immigration Service of Russia in Tajikistan.
The defense of your rights must begin before you leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve the problem of immigrant workers in 90% of cases.
The problems are faced by immigrants without a profession, education, who do not know the language or pass medical control.
Without an understanding of the language, Sebelev says, the future immigrant will be condemned to find unscrupulous people who, under the pretext of helping, take a “paid trip” to a creepy, narrow cove, where he and dozens of others like him are consumed for months without food or documents, working 12 to 14 hours a day.
We have received countless complaints from our immigrants.
“In their homeland they are promised one thing, but when they arrive they are cheated, they are deprived of their passports, they are not paid the promised wages,” says Tolib Sharipov, head of the labour immigration department of the Tajikistan Immigration Service.
Don't be angry, Chief!
However, meanwhile, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who wish to work in Russia recognize that they not only do not know the language of the country they intend to go to, but also write with difficulty in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault but their own misfortune: there are few Turkmens, Uzbeks, Tajiks who can afford to receive normal primary education.
This is because their families don’t even have anything to feed the children, let alone dress them up, put on their shoes and buy them what they need for school.
Upon reaching adolescence, these guys venture to work at the first opportunity.
It is difficult, if you do not know the language, they recognize it.
"One feels humiliated and inferior."
However, as far as the language law is concerned, rights defenders point out an important point.
The exams will be conducted only for immigrants whose status is legal.
If they do not have that status, there will be no examination and, consequently, no official work.
Meanwhile, most immigrant workers continue to live in Russia illegally.
"Welcome or forbidden passage to strangers"
Many visitors claim that receiving official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause lies in the bureaucratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language itself.
In addition, legalization costs money: from twelve thousand to sixteen thousand rubles.
However, a false inscription can be made quickly and for only one thousand five hundred rubles.
The employees of the Russian police know that we usually carry false documents, we are not registered and cases of extortion appear.
"We are asked for a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes or tea," Tajikistan citizen Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
"Come on, don't be a prick, buy a painting"
On the first day of the entry into force of the Language Act, it became clear that not only immigrant registration documents can be false.
Several “false” certificates of language proficiency have already been seized by Federal Immigration Service officials.
The forged documents had been printed on standard color printers.
Of course, they came into the hands of the new owners not as a gift: each immigrant, wanting to facilitate the task of passing the tests, paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official examination procedure, which will cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the near future is to protect the system against corruption so that “diplomas” cannot be bought, government officials and rights defenders converge.
So far, authorities can promise immigrant workers that they would not have been able to successfully pass the exam the first time longer to study the basic course of the language.
In addition, non-Russian-speaking immigrants will be offered jobs that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against the illegal arms trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite small
The Ministry of the Interior proposes to apply the law more rigidly with respect to owners of civilian weapons.
This is the government’s reaction to the recent incidents: Squeezing shots during wedding celebrations in which there were no victims, and the massacre initiated by Moscow lawyer Dimitri Vinogradov, in which Squeezing seven people lost their lives.
Police want to ban the use and possession of traumatic weapons in public places and raise the minimum age for obtaining a license to carry weapons, from 18 to 21 years old.
This idea was supported by the head of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that reforms to the gun ownership law would be brought to the State Duma in the near future.
Not everyone is happy with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to counter this problem by applying the “hard-hand policy”.
An open letter has appeared on the network, whose authors, representatives of various social organizations of shooters, demand that such measures of "senseless rigor" be given up.
The percentage of acts of vandalism with the use of registered weapons is minimal, said the BBC news service of Russia, criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lesnikov.
According to statistics from the Ministry of the Interior, during six months of 2012, 142 crimes involving the use of firearms were committed in internal organs, compared with a total of 1168 crimes registered for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that stricter legislation in the civilian weapons sector will not be an inconvenience for the offender to turn to the black market.
Now, according to his words, in Moscow you can find any weapon at a low price.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stated that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons was under control.
Suppliers: from factories to official
The black market for weapons is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are years, says retired Colonel V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Baranets, who for ten years worked in the Ministry of Education and in the High Staff.
Screenshot of the website that accepts orders for weapons
The first, "army or military vestige", i.e., weapons that were stolen during military actions in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by the Russian officers and by the Caucasians themselves,” says Baranets.
The next type of "black weapon",the ones stolen by criminals and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that this includes stolen weapons from police warehouses and those stolen directly by law enforcement officials.
Illegal weapons go on sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals there were often explosions.
“There are proven versions that some fires were premeditatedly set to cover the shortfall,” one ex-military official said.
According to Baranets, weapons manufacturers also put their sand granite.
“They have now proliferated private arms factories that are not competitive in the international market and distribute weapons under cordon to the black market, including that of Moscow,” the expert says.
Another source of the black market is smuggling.
A lot of guns and machine guns come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
“There they have their own production, sometimes artisanal, and a mafia has formed that has organized the flow of weapons,” explains the former military.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts have calculated what is the approximate share of each of these sources of supply of illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this topic was prepared in 2011 by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Management Planning.
The specialists analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminological bibliography and public access data of portals whose theme revolves around weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to the researchers, come from the armed forces and security forces.
Half of the black market’s weapons have arrived there “because of officials whose work is related to weapons,” the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from places where there are armed conflicts, 14% of the cases are stolen during the production of weapons and 5% correspond to the "illegal archaeology".
The clerk at one of the gun shops, who asked not to be named, says the weapons found by illegal excavators have not been bought by anyone for a long time because they are too old.
More often, he says, suppliers go to military warehouses when they need a shipment.
Through some charm, the supplier buys a unit, for example a TT gun.
They remove it from the register and pass it over the fence.
“He brings the gun to the city and sells it for 900 euros per unit with two chargers,” he tells us.
“But, of course, the police are aware of all the issues, so periodically, when the crime detection plan needs to be met, they make test purchases to the illegal arms dealers,” he adds.
"Like in a luxury boutique"
The seller and the buyer are usually found through acquaintances.
"I visited websites and blogs until a guy who proposed to me to go to the Begovaya platform, where there would be a man who would take me to a "skinny" where we could negotiate.
From the price of the gun, I found out only there.”
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun I need a friend who has contacts," says the store clerk. "I have a friend like that, but I don't trust him very much."
In the markets there are sellers, but there you also have to get there, say "on behalf of Mr. Ivanovi<0xC4><0x87>, who asked to tell him that his daughter had fallen a tooth."
I can even get a couple of steel handcuffs through a trusted person.
He also supplies them only to me because he knows that I will not betray him.
Beginners look for weapons in different ways.
Former military Viktor Baranets was put to the test in the role of buyer of illegal weapons in the mid-1990s, when he was about to publish an article on this subject.
The schemes, in his words, have not changed.
They gave him a photo album where there was "nothing at all".
“I felt like I was in a luxury boutique,” recalls the soldier.
The buyer, according to Baranets, is not offered a cat for a hare: everything there is can be tested.
I, as a potential customer, don’t just buy; we go with the seller to the forest, where we put a target.
“They give me the opportunity to shoot and when I make sure the gun shoots well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes the procedure.
Shop for sofas
Web search engines lead to sites and groups of "Vkontakte", where it is offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
No documents or personal meetings are required for this.
“It’s enough to have a certain amount of money,” they write in the headline of the ad, “Buying a gun or a machine gun.”
There users place their orders and ask questions.
Are they selling to minors?
"Without permission, of course," asks the user "Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n" (preserved spelling).
"Buy gun TT. Moscow", laconically formulates his question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-handedly captures those who wish to buy firearms.
And people go, like hungry fish to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia
Military and ex-military commentator Viktor Baranets
I have heard of these systems: usually, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make orders.
The buyer makes the payment through an ATM.
"In response, they send you a photo and instructions to let you know where the gun is hidden," said Dmitri Kislov, press secretary of the NGO The Right to Arms.
Viktor Baranets claims that if you place an order online, you are left without a gun and put in jail.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fictitious websites and two-handedly captures those who wish to buy firearms.
“And people, like hungry fish, go to the bait, and then, to extract coal in Siberia,” he says.
Makarov for $100
In the purchase of illegal firearms, according to experts, one can spend from 100 to 900 dollars.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The Right to Arms", a Makarov gun can be purchased for 100-300 dollars.
It will have to wait a month and a half.
It is sent from the military warehouses by the middle-ranking chiefs.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry, compared to the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia decreased by 7%, which constitutes 22,900, and the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices identified decreased by 7.8%.
Employees of fast food restaurants and supermarkets in the U.S. are on strike.
Up to a quarter of U.S. teens find their first jobs as cashiers at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has begun in the United States against low wages paid in Walmart supermarkets and restaurants of popular fast food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucky Fried Chicken".
For now no one dares to say whether or not this wave will reach the nine points, or whether it is destined to lose strength and settle down in its early stages.
The protest actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left-wing NGOs.
In addition to the modest wage increases perceived by Walmart workers and those of the fast food system, the goal of protest organizers is the creation of workers’ unions in these companies.
For now, this sector of the economy has hardly been occupied by the trade union movement.
Forty-six cents a year?
The actions began last week, after Thanksgiving Day, the so-called "Black Friday". That day, in the United States began the orgy of sales that captured millions of inhabitants, and that was sometimes accompanied by clashes.
That day, some workers at Walmart, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their jobs and formed protest pickets alongside unions and left-wing activists at Walmart stores, whose products target modest and moderate-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The products in their stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than those in larger supermarkets.
That’s why many poorly paid Walmart workers buy only at work.
Availability and product assortment have made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to two critics, Walmart can afford to sell products at very low prices, in part because it pays its workers little.
The latter also complain about poor working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
That “Black Friday” rally participants demanded the increase in wages and complained that the cost of health insurance provided by the corporation went from $30 to $100 a month.
For a typical Walmart worker, who gets $9.5 an hour, this expense is excessive, they said.
Scientists at the University of California at Berkeley argue that if Walmart raises the average salary to $12 an hour, it will cost the corporation $3.2 trillion.
This is about 1.1% more than you spend on wages now.
If Walmart puts the pay rise on consumers’ shoulders, every visit to the store will cost them just 46 cents more.
In a year they will spend the ridiculous amount of $12.39 more than they spend now.
Walmart supporters say the protest took place in only nine states and did not cause any loss to the corporation.
Black Friday extended in its stores from 8 p.m. on Thursday to midnight the next day and, during that time, Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, its cash registers made nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company’s representative, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview with the left-wing Huffington Post website that they left their job “less than five” Walmart employees and that the protest had been nothing more than “another PR stunt,” organized by the workers’ union.
"Free box!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the targets were not precisely Walmart department stores (which in this progressive city do not appreciate them, and for now there are none), but "McDonald's" and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and then they don't even give you sick leave and they don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, New York City Council Member
Currently, according to federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants are increasing it over time, but only slightly, and on average, ordinary workers receive $8.90 an hour in New York.
No one earns less than them in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with that money, for me it is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of American teenagers would walk past McDonald’s and work there, behind the counters, part-time after school, even though they still lived with their parents.
Few saw this as the main source of income or planned to stay there for a long time.
Now, I constantly stumble upon some interviews with McDonald’s workers who complain that they have to live on this salary, and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, in a forum of the Wall Street Journal there is a comment whose author points out that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know what to give them to eat.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday at McDonald’s on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that fast food cashiers and cooks start paying at least $15 an hour, i.e., double their current minimum wage.
They also demanded that workers’ unions be set up in the fast food sector.
U.S. law prohibits the administration from impeding this right and punishing trade union activists with cunning and dismissals.
On the other hand, administration rarely makes life easier for them.
But for objective reasons, it is easy for unions to embrace the fast food sector.
One of the main ones is the excessive rotation of the staff.
Discordant
Loud protests took place that same day at other cheap Manhattan restaurants.
The culmination of the action took place midway through the rally at McDonald’s near Times Square, which involved several local Democratic politicians, in particular City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, “McDonald’s says he’s selling billions of servings, and then he doesn’t even give you a hospital job or pay you.”
The protesters received support from other prominent New York Democrats, such as city mayor candidate Bill de Blasio, who said “we must support fast food workers so they can get the fair wages and economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves.”
As the New York Times described it, this has been the largest such demonstration in American fast food history.
But only a few hundred people took part in it, not even all of them were employees of the fast food service, in which tens of thousands of people from New York worked.
It is not yet clear whether this will spark a massive movement.
“For now, fooling the brain isn’t that easy.”
The topic of augmented reality, so popular among fans of modern technologies, lately is perceived with normality mainly through the prism of special glasses.
Earlier this summer, at its annual conference, Google demonstrated a moving model and later, in November, it was learned that Microsoft had also filed an application to claim the corresponding patent.
However, from a conversation with the head of the interactive technology group 3D at the Microsoft laboratory in Cambridge, Izadi Sharamom, it became clear that for the scientists of the company, the glasses already belonged to a past stage.
They are attracted by the prospect of manipulating virtual objects in the air with their bare hands and creating open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the purpose of your research group?
- We are dedicated to human-computer interaction, but we also try to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now humanity in its great mass has been trapped in the stage of working with the pixels of the flat screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look 5-10 years ahead and guess the cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since everyone is interested in gesture control.
- What else does the future hold for us?
Even though Kinect has taken interaction to the physical level, much of it still happens on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The information input has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We’re trying to change this, we’re working on truly three-dimensional visualization systems, based on different technologies, including design ones.
The world of computing must be liberated from ours, from the physical, to make it more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space surrounding it.
Then we can complete the real world with virtual objects in a more comfortable way.
First of all, hell with those stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think they overestimate it?
- Of course you can not be considered a panacea, it remains pending to solve the issue of privacy, since you do not always want others to know about our actions and intentions.
In fact, all types of interaction with computers are good, but each in its own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought about gestures, but not about loose movements, but shorter ones.
In addition, the gestures were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet that recorded the movement of the bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory it can be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But in general, the future is for a combined type of control, for example gesture + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass you this can of soda?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- Normally I just talk.
- Oh, that's gonna be very hard to recognize.
- That is, you want to force users to adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at this time?
- Not necessarily, but it's a mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will have to work mainly on the design of new types of sensors that can accurately determine the reactions of the person.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, as they provide good depth resolution, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with Xbox Kinect sensors, what complaints do you have about modern cameras?
Are you lacking resolution, depth or something else?
- In principle, the current generation is what may be the beginning of our work with three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixels at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in the megapixels, but in the quality of the matrix and in the depth.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us; this gives more work to algorithm designers.
That is, we have to remember not only the resolution on the X and Y axes, but also on Z.
Also important is the speed, the number of frames per second.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really scarce, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our laboratory in Redmond, made an adjustable processing delay contact sensor from 1 to 100 ms and it is worth mentioning that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands the extent to which this affects human-machine interaction.
For me it would be very useful for my work an equivalent of such a device, but that does not require contact for the frames per second to be more.
- And you don't need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect now has three "cameras", one of which is in fact the infrared emitter and the second the receiver of the reflected signal.
But the third camera is actually a simple visible fingerboard sensor.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Potentially, more cameras could solve the problem...
Or on the contrary, increase it and increase the required amount of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible Kinect analog, play with the location curvature of the cameras and see how this would help determine the three-dimensional position.
As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Don’t you think that, from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most visible platforms?
- Of course, spending all the time holding up a smartphone in your hands is not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an augmented reality "transmutable" when, based on a cloud platform, you could switch from glasses to the smartphone,
Glasses are very personal devices, that is their strength (private things only you can see them), but also their weakness: an augmented reality based on glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only to Tony Stark of the movie "Iron Man", but also to any simple mortal.
There is a problem with this idea that critics often point out: there is no tactile answer!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers does your group prepare for this challenge?
In my lectures I often say that augmented reality is the seventh burst in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth well could be the addition of tactile sensations.
Meanwhile, one of the most interesting tricks is the use of the second hand as a support for the image.
Record the touch perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly geared toward bringing tangibility to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located gives a feeling similar to that one feels if someone was blowing it into the fingertips, but that feeling is still very weak.
There are also wristbands that influence the nerve endings of the fingers, this is also a promising direction.
- Have you tried to fool the brain?
Make him think he feels what he should feel the moment he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we haven't tried it yet.
Here is another challenge that we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person physically located in a very small space believe that he is going to an open space, almost endless. We are also working on the idea of treadmills (not like gyms), mobile platforms, as well as that of giant balloons.
For now, deceiving the brain is not so easy, you still have to work for many years.
That’s what makes working with virtual reality appealing to researchers, who find many things in a state of total conception.
Subjective personal taste instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Vanguardism of St. Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are in front, at the forefront of art and culture.
In this list of the best are brilliant figures of art and the St. Petersburg scene, whose achievements reach beyond the city: they often find recognition in Europe without Russia even knowing them.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city meets Kirill Miller, a bearded man dressed in red from top to bottom, who can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Summer Garden or at fashion meetings and inaugurations.
Kirill Miller’s paintings always attract crowds, wherever they are exhibited.
Kirill Miller is one of those purely socio-philosophical storytellers of St. Petersburg, the creators of new mythologies.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of St. Petersburg vanguardism of the late 80s - early 90s.
In addition, he is an urban man, whose appearance on the streets of the city awakens in the inhabitants smiles and raises everyone's mood.
Recently, he took in his hands an organillo and became the organiller of St. Petersburg, as he has matured to make such a difficult role, for his bohemian existence, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you going around the city dressed in red and not yellow or turquoise, for example?
- I chose the red color because I am a fashion designer and I dedicate myself to appearance and image.
In this world, red is a commitment between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little gray provokes aggression and agitation of not good properties.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to debate.
- When did you realize you had to be an artist?
- In an exhibition of the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realized that that was my path.
Then the wave of old unofficial artists was over, and the new ones, free like me, were still misunderstood.
I became friends with artists of the new wave, with the later ones who were exposed in Gaza and Nevsky, which led to "Pushkinskaya-10", and the new wave is already over.
I went to the theater for clothes, music of all genres, but not for lyrics.
And all of this came together in your art clinic... it was important for me to find myself in the cultural center of St. Petersburg, where the best creative minds had to come together.
In 1995, I occupied a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a music art club, a bohemian club, the home of the bohemian Saint Petersburg.
Many were born there: Noms, Tequila Jazz, I remember the way Schnur brought the project to "Van Gogh's Ear".
Schnur and his friends sang light songs under the phonogram, wore tight pants, among them was the current fashion composer Igor Vdovin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg was animator of many programs before the times of Hali-galivskih.
We gave Trachtenberg and it was the beginning of his great career; basic education and training received it from us.
Gallery "D 137", the "Club Griboyedov", are the remains of the Art Clinic.
There were our employees and regular customers.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture meant something.
In the year 2000, the survey was made in the press, the prize was "The people of our city".
In the nomination "Artist of the Year" I was chosen, so ended my culmination.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who likes the truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
In our times it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity go separate. One can be popular but very little cult.
- There's something recognisable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they clearly express the present and the occurrence.
I'm going to do a scheduled exhibition, "The Russian Museum in Clowns."
Clowns are a timeless category.
I used to be sociable, but now being so is painful and frightening.
But in the clowns everything gets clogged up and the tragedy is eliminated.
I love the grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a totalitarian and obligatory change of clothes.
Now one is followed by clothing, orientated to the outside, but not to the inside of the person.
And, perhaps that person should not even be given a hand, but spit in his face.
And the deception will be removed when you change clothes.
- We just saw you in the role of urban organizer. - A cultured city must have a hero like that.
Who better than me to be!
- Well, but, at best, commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be scrupulous, sweet, have touch.
We are witnessing the disintegration of cultures.
Before the people were grouped into herds, the bohemians wanted one thing, the simpletons another.
Now everyone has split into micro-communities, it’s hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill to please everyone.
Now you have to think about who you want to like.
Now, every cult hero has his 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov they arrive by the thousands!
- The abandoned ones are going to see it, that's where the sex-social sphere works.
And at a cultural event there are 300 people, 10,000 will never come. As a result, less management, less money, everything goes awry.
I have my fans, the most important thing is not to deceive them, not to lose what you have achieved.
When I was young I made such paintings that a collector had them hung on the wall next to Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, which people usually end up with.
Now they often confuse concepts.
They say spiritual culture, consumer culture.
There is no culture in consumption, that is another story.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who refused money just to paint paintings.
I am in favor of this culture.
- Kirill, what's missing in St. Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a concept: an official of culture.
But not all of them can be devoted to culture.
When kings were right everything was different, kings might not understand culture very well, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the right experts.
There are very good consultants in Moscow now.
We have people in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they are closed, because they need experts at a higher level who properly evaluate them and pave the way for them.
Subjective personal taste is now thriving.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they honestly say that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists who have to look for other museums.
- What is St. Petersburg to you?
- St. Petersburg is not a cultural capital. In Moscow there is much more culture, there is land.
But on our stones it is difficult for art to grow.
We need cultural ground and we now have more writers than readers, this is wrong.
In Europe there are a lot of people with curiosity who go to exhibitions and concerts.
In our case, this class is tiny.
We have to make art fashionable, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project will be implemented with a St. Petersburg grant.
Giving birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Global warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with humans on board set off in search of a replacement planet.
In order to preserve humanity, the main question is: How to continue the species in conditions of pregnancy or on the same spare planet?
I think there is little to choose from.
In fact, only two are real planets that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"These are Venus and Mars," says the chief researcher at the State Astronomical Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if conditions on Mars are better for life, on the surface of Venus the temperature is 500 degrees.
You can only live at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus... in space.
It began to address the problems of reproduction in space with the flora.
Half a century ago, experiments with plants were carried out.
Four generations of peas grown in orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then came the breeding of insects in orbit, small fruit flies, the drosophila.
In 1979 quail eggs were sent into space to check how the embryo develops under conditions of unpregnancy.
As a result, we get a normal chicken.
But then the problems begin.
“The problem is that this chick has to find support, it has to stay on its own feet and start moving,” explains Vladimir Sychev, the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Biomedical Problems (IPBM) of the Russian Academy of Sciences.
Unable to find support, the chicks randomly flipped.
And after 10 hours in newborns there was a total atrophy of instincts.
The chicks did not react to light or sound.
And the misfortune was that after four days they simply died.
“And twice we got the chicks born, but then we left him because it was impossible to work there with them,” says Vladimir Sychev about the failure of the experiment with the chicks in space.
The last time a biological “miniarch” flew into orbit was 16 years ago.
Experiments will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, in the biosatellite "Bion" will only travel species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats, which were sent into space already with fetuses.
In principle, nothing supernatural was found.
“This was precisely in the biosatellites, but this was a unique experiment, and studies like this must be carried out,” says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the space rats had offspring.
However, it has not yet been possible to address the problem of reproduction directly in space.
It's a difficult challenge.
Animals, by losing their usual habitat, simply cannot realize their sexual instinct.
Man, however, unlike small animals, in principle, can.
Homo sapiens has abstract reasoning and is able to create a proper emotional background.
Similar experiments are not conducted for ethical reasons.
But women have been traveling to space for 50 years.
Tereshkova took the biggest risk.
And the most precious thing that humanity has is the female organism.
Our gull is flying, and no one on Earth could say: if it is after a flight into space.
You may or may not have a baby after this flight.
“After all, no one has answered this question,” said aerospace veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after a year of flying into space, the first woman cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The girl's father, Andrian Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was twice in orbit and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk persists.
We are few, the astronauts are counted to whom after long flights everything has turned out well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if more can be said, it is dangerous even in orbital flights," summarizes the cosmonaut pilot, hero of the Soviet Union, hero of Russia, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must seek some new avenues in biotechnology, in radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is a mandatory stage in the preparation for the flight.
In conditions of zero buoyancy, cosmonauts practice their working skills in space.
Water simulates weightlessness.
If for an adult the water is a comfortable environment, although still hostile, for a newborn child it is its natal element.
The little amphibious men seem to confirm that life on earth arose from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is about 9 months inside his mother in the amniotic fluid, as it will be easier for him to get used to the water later.
In principle, this is logical, because from the moment of birth to the moment of the first bath pass only 2 weeks.
“This is too little to forget something,” says Marina Aksenova, a newborn swimming monitor.
In short, if weightlessness is a more natural state for a newborn, for women it is necessary gravity, the force of gravity.
In pregnancy, the abdominal and pelvic muscles decrepinate very quickly, the ability to expel the fetus is reduced.
Well, we omit that, relying on the action of stimulants for childbirth.
You can, of course, give birth in a special camera, it will push you.
"And then what?", Valeri Polyakov asks this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sensation of gravity, the body does not generate the skeleton or the muscular system.
A newborn in orbit is impossible to wear with a special suit for training, as adults.
He will simply be deprived of what is vital to him.
“And this experiment that we are going to do together, by allowing the birth of a child in a strange environment, will lead to us bringing to Earth a disabled person, a totally unsuitable person,” predicts the head of the bioethics committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
For now, the birth of children in space is a theoretical matter.
However, over time this will be a reality, when humans in their spacecraft head to a distant planet that will be home to their children born in space.
Head of NKU: The inspection of the system "<0xC5><0xA0>varc" has not happened with the guilty politician
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has good inspectors and quality legislation, although its implementation is slow.
This is stated by Miloslav Kala, vice-president of the Office of Supreme Control (NK<0xC3><0x9A>) in an interview for Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"The law will never be perfect," but its application must be correct. "This is, in my opinion, what we lack," thus describes the current situation.
Joint checks by Czech and German inspectors also reach similar conclusions.
As an example of an incorrect practice, he mentions Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as' attitude towards the system of being autonomous only on paper, which is known as the "<0xC5><0xA1>varc" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that the SDGs (Civil Democratic Party) would not bother employers with inspectors. So is it forbidden or allowed?
“The law must be regulated in some way and if it prohibits something, in that case, neither the president of the government can prevent the performance of the office that has the obligation to carry out such checks or to demand obligations,” states Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Commission in the Congress of Deputies, you spoke about the joint project between the Czech and German teams, in which the legislation on public procurement in both countries was compared.
What is it exactly?
This is a parallel control that we started to carry out about two years ago.
Put simply: European legislation regulates how public procurement should be organised, this is followed by the legislation in force in each country and then the practice itself.
We have put everything together and, although the control has not yet been finalized, we have obtained very interesting differences. Generally, our country's legislation is "stricter and more comprehensive", however, the concrete practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate increasingly strict rules, but that it is necessary to concentrate on the application of the law itself.
What can this project actually contribute? What do you think are the conclusions?
Precisely such a common control could help us to stop investing in the implementation of laws, the reduction and the improvement of limits, although this does not have such a positive impact.
The economy of saving means getting something suitable at a reasonable price (which does not always mean that the price is the lowest) to avoid thus enrichment and, in the long run, criminal actions.
But not by reducing the limit of the awards means that we are going to get it.
Perhaps because the system is saturated with so much paperwork that those who want to look for flaws in the system will be able to do so more easily than if the limits were kept as high as they are now.
You are talking about the problems of our country with the transfer of legislation regulating the practice of public procurement.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is it an office similar to our NK<0xC3><0x9A> or is it organized in a different way?
As for the offices, such as the NK<0xC3><0x9A>, there is the Bundesrechnungshof (Federal Court of Auditors), with an organization similar to ours, with a school as well, the only thing is that in your case it is structured in a somewhat different way, but in principle both offices evolve in parallel.
Competences are also somewhat analogous, however, while Germany has a federal organization, the courts of account are even at this level. In this respect it differs slightly from our system.
The Federal Court of Accounts (BRH) can only control federal money, what we here call state funds.
The public funds, which are administered by the regions and municipalities, there, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Accounts.
As for local legislation, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to make a comparison without specific data, but Germany is still a model in some respects, but it is not clear exactly what is best.
Could it be better, for example, in terms of the quality of inspectors?
Of course not, but, I repeat, I do not like to make such comparisons.
It is necessary to say that even those countries that we take as a model must face a large number of problems.
If it were not so, it would be of no benefit to them to collaborate with our office, don't you think?
With regard to the legislation of our country, what did the amendment of the law on public procurement mean to your Office?
Given that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been stated in the control proceedings.
Since we carry out ex post controls, we need to have a certain delay.
For now, we are looking at the process of preparing future controls: we have started a new tool for "non-economic risk detection", through which we have passed almost 14,000 public tenders, which have been analyzed. The changes will be perfectly reflected here, as the limits are changed, the conditions of some types of the selection process are corrected and the like.
Do you consider the passage of this law to be beneficial or rather a stumbling block to the bureaucratic system?
I think this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope it is.
The problem that may arise is that the regulation "hardens" and that it is impossible to comply with it.
Already with the previous regulations, the controlled persons were linked to the contractor (for example, in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional council), and every law not respected in the field of public procurement meant the violation of budgetary discipline.
Does it make sense then to tighten the law in this way?
I don't think so.
The system should exclude those who want to attack it or take advantage of it and not punish those who make a formal ruling, which has no bearing on decision-making.
Such a system will only create greater bureaucratic pressure.
And how do you get out of this?
We will see where this path leads us.
The Prime Minister has recently stated that the SDGs would not bother employers with controls of the so-called <0xC5><0xA0>varc system, referring to the fact of being autonomous only on paper. What does this mean?
Is the <0xC5><0xA0>varc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in some way and, if it prohibits something, then not even the Prime Minister of the Government can prevent the Office from acting which has the obligation to carry out such checks and to demand obligations.
You can say, "We changed the law and we allowed it," but you can't say we'll do it like nothing.
In the Public Procurement Act, the regulations are quite strict as to how to act formally, and that is how it should be to protect public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is tragic that the candidate with the best offer is excluded for not meeting the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be correct. That is, in my opinion, what we lack.
Roads have ice sheets, although they are mostly tradable.
In several places in the Czech Republic the roads feature ice and snow plates.
Although most roads are tradable, caution should be exercised in some.
Karlovy Vary Region
This morning the roads in the Karlovy Vary region were passable, but they had ice and snow plates.
The temperature drops and will fluctuate between five and ten degrees below zero. During the day the thermometers will rise slightly.
It has stopped snowing in the region and in the low areas the snow layer is thin.
On the other hand, on the ridges of the Metal Mountains the snow reaches almost 30 centimeters.
In some places visibility was still poor because of the fog, according to information from the region’s road traffic control center.
The R6 expressway and top-notch road in the region are now freely tradable.
However, extreme caution is recommended, especially on some bridges whose surface can be icy and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also tradable.
However, in some of them there are still stretches with remnants of ice and suffocated snow.
Attention needs to be increased on the road, especially in the higher areas.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové
In some roads in East Bohemia there is a danger of frost and in higher areas and in the mountains may have formed a layer of snow on the roads, reports on its pages the Directorate of roads and highways.
Road operators warn drivers of the danger of ice sheets forming, especially in higher areas of the Pardubice region.
Ice can occur in the vicinity of Lan<0xC5><0xA1>krouna, <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Orlic<0xC3><0xAD>, Poli<0xC4><0x8D>ky, Svitav or Vysokého M<0xC3><0xBD>ta, and especially on the second and third category roads.
The I/43 and I/34 roads in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There is snow especially on the roads of the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e mountains to Orlické hory.
There is a layer of snow on the highest areas of the roads in the municipalities of Rychnov nad Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>nou and Trutnov.
In the area of East Bohemia, the sky will be clear today between clear and partly cloudy, with no precipitation.
Temperatures will usually range between three below zero and a positive degree, a weak wind will blow.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are transitable this morning, but caution must be exercised and time will have to be adjusted.
In the early hours of the morning there will be frosts, temperatures will fluctuate between three and nine degrees below zero.
After the snowfall and the subsequent drop in temperatures, some roads could also be covered with ice.
In some places drivers will encounter fog, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is what emerges from the information of the road operations control center of the region.
The D5 motorway is almost unrestricted, although extreme caution is recommended, especially on the road between the 80 and 131 kilometres.
The surface of most top-notch roads is dry and ice-free.
In the area of the road Pilsen and Tachov border with Germany there may be sections with ice plates.
The second and third category tracks are wet, so in this case, we also warn of stretches with ice plates.
Drivers should be more cautious, especially on less traveled roads in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava area.
Olomouc Region
Drivers heading to the highest areas of the Olomouc region will encounter partially-wasted snow.
After the chemical treatment, there was still snow in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské and on the way towards Videlsk<0xC3><0xBD> k<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0xBE>.
Road operators removed the snow overnight; about three centimeters of snow accumulated on the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, according to track managers.
In the rest of the region, most roads are freely accessible.
"In the highest areas of the <0xC5><0xA0>umper road, there are remains of snow.
Drivers in the port of <0xC4><0x8C>ervenohorské will find half-waste snow in the direction of Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k," a road administration operator from <0xC5><0xA0>umper confirmed today to <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
On the ground and at night his colleagues also came to the Jesenick<0xC3><0xA1> and, after chemical treatment, the slopes of the highest areas are now clear and wet.
On the Olomouc road the roads are freely tradable, on the <0xC5><0xA0>ternbersk<0xC3><0xA1> road the drivers should drive cautiously in the forest sections, where the roads are still wet.
Region of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and region of Liberec
Road operators in northern Bohemia have reported complications on different sections early in the morning.
Apart from some places where it has snowed or iced, according to the police database the mountain road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice in the region of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem is closed.
Temperatures are kept below zero, even in the lower areas, so ice and snow obviously remain on the road, but in the lower areas, especially in the southeast of the Czech central massif, there are no problems and the roads are usually dry.
No service complications have been reported so far.
Road operators have warned of the presence of ice in the surroundings of <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>t<0xC3><0xAD>.
According to meteorologists, conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day rain and snow are expected to melt and at night the sky will be clear and there will be ice.
From the general roads, unfavorable conditions have been announced on the I/13 road, on the border between the region of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem and Liberec.
The road between Telnice and Kn<0xC3><0xAD>nice had to be cut down by the branches of the trees that had been arched over the road with the weight of the snow.
<0xC5><0xA0>imon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accumulate positive energy
It is said that in a little less than a month the end of the world will come, what do you think about it?
It’s just one of so many other alarming news that we like to cling to.
The Tap Tap music group likes to make jokes about this and we like to say that we are the only music group in the world that manages to gather enough positive energy to postpone the end of the world or to avoid it.
In addition, in December you organize a really original project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you explain this to our readers?
This is a state benefit act that we have been planning for two years.
We decided to take advantage of the marketing potential that has the end of the Mayan calendar set for December 21st at 11:10 in the morning.
The previous day, on December 20 at 9 pm, we will organize 3 simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end about the same time the Mayan calendar ends on Kiribati Island in the Pacific Ocean, 12 hours ahead of our time zone.
Who came up with this idea?
Initially it was my idea, then we were forging the project together with our designer Honza Augusta.
In addition to wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we will leave the world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar we have also created a unique collection of items: boots, t-shirts, bags and original keychains against the end of the world that can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz, another way to support us.
The group The Tap Tap, along with other performers, also sang the so-called anthem against the end of the world, which bears the title "End of the world, cancelled".
It is currently very popular on YouTube, can you hear it at the benefit concerts?
Of course it is, and it will be just the last, well, as long as everything goes well and the world does not end...
It will be performed by all the performers at the same time in all three concerts.
The anthems will be linked to each other simultaneously thanks to the special live broadcast on Czech Television.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Han<0xC3><0xA1>k has written the lyrics of this song and plays the role of Jesus in the video clip, where he also sings Xindl X...
How did this collaboration come about?
We work together even with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, apart from organizing many charity events and concerts...
We make every effort to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them are interested and enjoy working with us.
What will the money raised in concerts against the end of the world be used for?
The equipment for the school without barriers Studeo, which we carried out in its sixth consecutive year with the Tap civil association in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav.
Students of the Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav school regularly receive visits from teachers with fun and interesting activities.
Students do not have sufficient financial means to pay teachers and we make an effort to make this possible.
As part of the completion of the works at Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav, there will be an independent building to which we will move with this project.
In each concert there are several groups and performers.
What are the selection criteria?
We are trying to develop a program that is appealing to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague they will perform Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, The Tap Tap, Mari<0xC3><0xA1>n Bango and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
For more detailed information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Have you planned any other similar “spectacular action” in the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at the Pra<0xC5><0xBE>ské jaro festival, so here we will surely prepare an attractive program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to play at the Bohemian National Hall in New York and myself, personally, taking advantage that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not precisely minimalist, so far you have acted for example in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How is the logistics and organization of these trips?
It’s not as difficult as it may seem at first glance.
There are five members in the electric wheelchair, the chairs must travel in the luggage compartment and we also carry a lot of weight, the boxes with the instruments...
However, so far we have managed well. <0xC4><0x8C>SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, which does not cease to surprise me.
Even in Moscow, from where we recently returned, everything went smoothly.
Thanks to the trips abroad, you can compare the different attitudes of society towards the disabled and other aspects.
What have you found so far?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have seen that, in the east, there is a long way to go.
Unlike Prague, Moscow is full of barriers, where it is still uncommon for a person to travel alone through the center of the city in an electric wheelchair.
Something as common as giving preference to someone in an elevator wheelchair, for example, is not there.
Fortunately, a civil partnership has been established to address the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what aspects should we take the example of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects in which we go behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation always depends on the people to whom it directly affects.
In London and Madrid it is very normal for people with a serious disability to travel on their own in public and be able to go to the service, to the museum, wherever they want to go.
But it is not very common for a large number of people with disabilities to actively participate in social life, in this respect, with The Tap Tap we go a little ahead!
A respectful or barrier-free society is one thing, but when the time comes for eminent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers to emerge, it will begin to change everything.
So far, they are isolated cases of people who have a great willpower.
The group The Tap Tap is currently very popular, but if we look a few years back, what led you to form the group in 1998?
I entered as an educator at Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav, where there were many young people around me who wanted to dedicate themselves to something.
And since I am a musician, I play, among others, the saxophone, I founded an amateur group with a co-worker.
And over time, as our moderator L<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8F>a Angelovi<0xC4><0x8D> says, we got a little out of hand (laughs).
However, the popularity did not come until these last few years, or am I wrong?
It’s true that connecting with famous singers and also actively working to promote the group helped us a lot.
We come to the conclusion that the work that is not seen is as if it does not exist.
Thanks to the help of the European Union, we can also afford quality teaching, equipment, etc.
Were you planning to get that far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning I saw the potential that there was, that you can do something else.
The world of entertainment is full of things that look like each other.
It is logical, in its own way, that everything new is welcomed with caution and it takes a long time to accept itself.
There are few extraordinary things, but I dare say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who sees us for the first time is clearly compassion, it is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not abandoned beings who suffer and of whom we should have compassion.
There are people who are able to live a full life and develop, provided, of course, that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well for people with disabilities, then it’s not just a breakthrough for them, but for society as a whole.
Did the fact that you are a demanding boss, as many people describe you, help?
If we want to do quality work, we have to be rigorous in many respects and require some discipline.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people arrive with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and when they find out that they have to go two days to rehearse, go to the preparatory test and spend a lot of time traveling and in concerts, the initial euphoria quickly abandons them.
But that’s how it works everywhere, in every group that wants to work and get something done.
The Tap Tap group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were there at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: the Angelovitch boat.
We're an open group, people come in and out, you can't help it.
Those who have will and desire will always find the doors open.
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, on Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 hours
It will take place at the Incheba Arena in Prague, in Fléda in Brno and in Plynojem in Ostrava and 12 groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic will participate
The three cities will connect at the end of the evening through videoconference to sing together the song of the group The Tap Tap "End of the world, canceled"
The purpose of the concert is to gather the necessary resources to finance multifunctional equipment of the STUDEO barrier-free educational center in Jedli<0xC4><0x8D>k<0xC5><0xAF>v <0xC3><0xBA>stav in Prague, which costs 25 million Czech crowns.
Admission to the concert costs 400 CZK and children up to 12 years old have free entrance in the early sale option on Bohemiaticket
Poland and the Cosmos.
At the meeting of ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency held last week, Poland was accepted as the twelfth member of ESA. It is the second ESA member country of the former Eastern European bloc, after the Czech Republic, which became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began an intensive collaboration with ESA in 1994 and during the following years participated in the agency’s project commission.
However, Poland’s journey to the cosmos began much earlier.
Polish enthusiasts were already engaged in space flights before World War II, although their work was not always understood.
I remember, for example, A. <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld's lecture at the Astronomical Observatory in Warsaw in which, on December 6, 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneering study "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the assistants indifferent and, years later, <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld recalled that Dr. Jan Gadomski had been the only one who had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 <0xC5><0xA0>ternfeld was awarded the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his "Introduction to Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966), mentioned above, later became a great driver of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomsky became a promoter of cosmonautism, he was known throughout the world and his contribution to science was rewarded when he named one of the craters on the moon's hidden face.
Already in 1925 a dresin was built in Poland that was to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, it is not known who was the author of the proposal and the details of the project are also not known.
It is not clear whether the rocket was going to be used for the start of the dragline or for its braking.
The information about this dresin is limited to the collection in the press of the time.
In 1933, the Polish artillery began to engage in missiles.
The research was funded by Kom<0xC3><0xB3>rka Techniki Uzbrajenia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfkem and Prof. Gustave Mokrzyckiegim.
From the preserved material, it becomes evident that the research reached the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of German troops, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937 the prototype of a photoelectric hunting missile designed by the engineer Rohozinski appeared in the specialized press and the following year the study "Rakieta - torpedo powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocki was published.
Both projects were intended for military use of missile engines.
Shortly before the war, the Provisional Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy) was in charge of all projects of missile techniques for military use and coordinated all work.
The committee was founded in 1937, but after two years of activity, it was interrupted by the start of the war.
Other studies on cosmonautics appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Society of Astronautics (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, the society is referred to for the first time with four very extensive articles dedicated to astronautics.
One of them, by Professor M. Subotowicze, proposed the creation of a society dedicated to cosmonautics.
By that time artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was obvious that cosmic research was a discipline with prospects for the future.
Since the beginning of 1956 the Polish Society of Astronautics (PTA) aspired to be part of the International Astronautical Federation (founded in 1951) and in the autumn of the same year the PTA became a full member.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902–1959), became the vice president of the International Astronautical Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Beginning in 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the RM rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first Polish rocket in which scientific research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957 and was first launched on October 10, 1958.
The rocket had an apogee of 1,800 meters, about 80 cm in length and did not reach 5 kg in weight.
Later, the RM-1A version was completed and in the summer of 1959 air tests of the two-stage RM-2 rockets were started in the B<0xC5><0x82><0xC4><0x99>d<0xC3><0xB3>w desert.
The rocket measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of rocket in development was to be the subject of real scientific study. The RM-34 rocket was to have a peak of 14.5 km and its mission would be to control the high wind.
In 1962, however, work was suspended.
The successor to the first RM rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed, which differed from each other by the space available for scientific apparatus.
In the Meteor-1A rocket the available space for the volume was 0.4 liters, in the Meteor-1B 0.34 liters and in the Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum apogee in all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Air Institute, whose first aerial tests were started in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 rocket had an initial weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg up to 60 km in height.
Later, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also necessary to mention the entry of Poland into the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the formation of the COSPAR national committee two years later.
As part of the Interkosmos program, Poland joined the research of space on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimir Remek.
The suspension of the Social Work Act is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court suspended the Social Work Act.
The resolution sparked a heated discussion in society.
It will certainly be interesting to examine the existing problem from a broader point of view.
Liberal economic systems in the EU, as in the globalised world, are based on the principle of greater economic and less regulatory competition.
Consequently, this means that different economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict with each other.
The cause lies in the principle of free trade and the free and unlimited movement of private capital, along with rampant financial speculation.
The effect of large differences in labour costs (of wages) produces economic tensions.
Under this concept it is necessary to understand the situation in which the manufacturer, with the import of cheap goods, tries to shorten distances and to do so "causes a bazadda" of the competitor's price in order to make the most of the market and thus increase its profit margin.
Large-scale means, for most entrepreneurs, moving production abroad, buying there cheaper or disappearing. The result is high unemployment in those countries where the price of labor, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because private capital has no social responsibility and, as a result, is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expenditure of the state necessarily increases.
This whole situation fosters the total disinterest of entrepreneurs in paying taxes and compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused in their pursuit of profits.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to present specific statistical data.
The unscrupulous practices of private capital create situations, in certain economies, in which the governments of these countries are forced to compete with the aim of artificially reducing the social level of the population itself and thus attracting foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments make private capital available to their own population without taking into account social decline.
This is especially evident in the changes in current laws.
The aim is to force the population to accept the dictation of private capital, especially with regard to wages.
This takes place, on the one hand, through the system of economic obligation in the case of long-term unemployment; on the other hand, through the restricted right of employees with regard to labour rights.
The result is growing poverty along with increasing disparities between the poor and the rich.
For a number of years, there have been food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot keep up with their own work.
The number of people receiving this type of aid is already one million.
In the context of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, a fairly frequent case occurs: people employed at such a low wage that the state must pay the rest to reach the minimum necessary to survive.
A scandal of this kind related to the situation of auxiliary employees of the German federal parliament was made public.
The austerity measures of virtually all the southern states of the EU lead, without a doubt, to the same situation. People, pressured by an abysmal decline in their social level, are forced to emigrate as in the 19th century or to live with a lousy wage at the limit of society, in the hope that one day it will reach the private capital-investor country.
Is it necessary to ask where it comes from?
In the case of other EU countries, then poverty passes from one country to another or never arrives, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turks, Moroccans, Egyptians or Africans continue to work for a tiny part of a European salary.
This also affects the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim even satiety that the state should not contribute capital to the economy, that directing the economy leads to its failure.
Private capital defends with fingernails and teeth the thesis that the state should not intervene in the economy by meddling in control.
Next, it is necessary to ask whether private capital does not influence its egoism in the political march and, therefore, throughout the state.
In this case, the answer is clearly affirmative.
The proof is the existence of lobbies, in practice very powerful and ubiquitous, in every state.
The result is a desperate situation that manifests itself in the area of corruption, in mutual favour, in legislation that is virtually reprehensible everywhere but is not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: state ministries, in the absence of financial means, are tasked with drafting bills for private legal firms, which are often linked to industry.
These types of bills are later passed in the Bundestag, the German parliament.
In this way, all power does not emanate from the people, as it is announced in the constitutions of Western democracies, but from the strong financial groups that represent their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation quickly find themselves in a situation such as that described by Appianus in his The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Times of Caesar and Pompeii: "The state had been disintegrating for a long time and the administrations were occupied by force."
In exchange for bribes, favors obtained illegitimately and help to finance stones or swords.
The bribery and corruption were spread without any impediment and the people went to the polls with the vote was always democratized "... there were no people with character who aspired to a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consuls "... "It began to be so serious that the self-sovereignment was necessary "
The conclusion, as in ancient times, is that today’s society is based on unconsidered preferences of individual benefit without regard to common interests.
Private capital is not able, in its essence, to understand and claim the benefits of society as a whole.
The result is the same as then, an unprecedented decline of the elite, without any effort being made to reform it in depth.
The causes of the rise of fascist and communist regimes must therefore be sought in the rampant liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
With regard to the current situation, it is possible to consider the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of a liberal democracy, as a definite pause, waiting for the next coup.
The really devastating fact is that the current elite completely ignores the losses of hundreds of thousands in lives, the social and humanitarian catastrophes of which we have witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity as we know them in ancient and recent history.
The suspension of the public procurement law is not the solution; at least not in the long term.
Under pressure from economic competition, both internationally and within the EU, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue looking for other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is, therefore, systemic.
The solution is through concrete socio-political reforms, which strengthen both the participation of state capital and the influence of citizens in government and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: the laboratory of chaos.
"That nothing comes from violence and nothing ever could", Sting in his song Fragile and whose refrain reads "Let's do not forget how fragile we are" (let's not forget how fragile we are).
"If my children did not want wars, there would be none" Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, on his deathbed in 1849.
After the latest waves of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, various reactions have emerged, as always.
One, on the Israeli side, argues in favor of the right of self-defence and encases Palestinians in the role of terrorists; the other supports Palestinians and alleges racism on the part of the State of Israel, genocide against Palestinian Arabs, and a flagging of Israel as a terrorist state.
I do not want to focus on who is to blame for the periodic killings and who is the victim. After all, today’s citizens of Israel, including the autonomous territories, were born within the current political situation and did not experience the beginnings of violence.
My intention is to offer readers a behind-the-scenes look, a look to discover who is taking advantage of the tensions that have been dragging on for 95 years (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) on a small Middle Eastern land surface.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others on conclusions I have reached on the basis of my own understanding of the matter, about who or what group of people is the main driver of the events of modern history.
In the history of mankind, the history of power struggles is at the forefront.
In every age we can find a Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
But what is no longer so obvious is whether it was always these characters who guided their steps autonomously or if behind their throne there was someone who guided their actions towards a certain goal.
We must accept that we are living in an era that concentrates the wealth of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that this implies has not been achieved in a single generation.
Among these astronomically rich families stands out one that could be considered the most prominent (if there is still someone behind it, I don’t know, but I don’t rule it out): the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Of course.
In the 1990s they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to stop associating their name with very serious criminal acts. Power and wealth, or both, covered their backs, which for them always meant a strengthening.
They have major stakes in almost every central bank in the world and in those countries in which they are not represented, have declared or are preparing a war: before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5, after overthrowing Gaddafi there were only four, but meanwhile Russia has subordinated the central bank to the Russian government.
Anyone who has tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Rothschild Central Bank of America, began printing money during the Civil War, and was assassinated in 1865 in the theater.
JFK began printing money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after wanting to sue the Fed for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their quest for world power led them during the years 1859 - 1871 to draw up a plan with three world wars, designed by the mason Albert Pike, decorated with the degree 33.
The first war was intended to eliminate the great monarchical states throughout Europe; the second wanted to eliminate the colonial supremacy, especially the British solution, and the third was intended to reduce the population of the earth between half a million and a billion people (such a number of slaves for their welfare and luxury would suffice and would not consume so many resources), in addition to the creation of a universal and universal religion.
The method by which the group of wealthiest families operates, along with the Rothschilds, follows the dynamics of crisis triggering and the subsequent offering of a solution (order ab cao – order from chaos).
These solutions are, however, wrong, and always lead to a worsening of the situation. Otherwise, it is enough to remember that the Fed was created so that a crisis like that of 1907 would not be repeated.
So, after the success of the assassination of the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, Franz Ferdinand, in Sarajevo and after the First World War ensued, they destroyed Tsarist Russia with the beginning of the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended suddenly and unjustifiably from a military and economic point of view, the capitulation of Germany (the wars to end Tsarist Russia were already unnecessary) and the subsequent dismemberment of the great power of Central Europe, the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
In order to prepare the ground for the Second World War, they allowed the bankers and politicians to create, in a covert way, a strong conflict situation in the wake of the enormous war reparations imposed on Germany, thereby creating the optimal conditions for the radicalization of the impoverished masses.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds promoted the founding of the Zionist movement, a branch that aspired to the formation of a Jewish state, preferably in the region of ancient Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour declaration laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine and began the first conflicts with the Arab population of the place.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out: it is difficult to know whether Hitler threw too much of the rope to which the international bankers had tied him in the beginning or whether everything he did was part of a plan. However, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the optimal conditions for the acceptance of the Jewish state in world society.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, similarly to the way war reparations imposed on Germany paved the way for World War II, with the proclamation of the state of Israel the focus was set for a third war.
If international bankers could get it started, the Jewish nation, as in World War II, would become a frontline victim, now along with the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a welding machine and chaos, not only within the framework of its country, but also on an international scale. Let us take as an example how Israel’s supporters and detractors are sharply divided.
Who is to blame and who is the victim in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict? Where does injustice engender injustice in a spiral of endless violence, if at the beginning of everything was the greed of some individuals and their desire for world power?
At this point it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, because, as is the case in our country, international bankers only present their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of a fascist politician, loyal to the global bankers, who does everything possible to declare war on Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we consider that Iran controls the narrow 20% of the world.
In what light are now shown the words spoken by David Rockefeller in 1994: "All we need is a general crisis and people will agree to a new world order."
The new world order in your imagination is a world of lords and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves a handful of people who are part of the well-off financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new individual is implanted with a chip at birth that controls their entire being.
And it compels all, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to have a mark on the right hand or forehead, not to be able to buy or sell, unless they bear the name of this monster or the figures of his name.
It is necessary to understand it: whoever has two front fingers, add up the numbers of this monster.
The number marks the person and this number is six hundred and sixty-six.”
Argo Movie: If It Gets Raw, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of Islamist student protesters occupied the U.S. embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
Their release was to be in exchange for the dethroned Shah Mohamed Réza P<0xC3><0xA1>hlevi, who after the revolution fled to the US, a country that had sponsored his regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation offered no positive prospect: throwing the Shah over the edge could not be allowed, since if it did, it would jeopardize the confidence of its allies in other countries.
But the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution had led to the constitution of the theocratic regime, was not within their reach.
It was a blow to the prestige of the United States, which subsequently intensified further with the failed attempt to free the hostages by force.
The imprisoned diplomats were released 444 days after the Algerian government’s negotiating intervention.
In the U.S., his fate caused a wave of solidarity and animosity against Iran.
The failure in Iran contributed decisively to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film "Argo" by director and actor Ben Affleck the subject of an episode of this story, which garnered a small success for America.
Shortly before occupying the embassy, six employees escaped from the building.
After a complicated journey, they ended up at the Canadian Embassy’s residence.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to get them out of Iran, for which it helped a covert story an extravagant point: they came out with Canadian passports, as members of the film team examining the location in the country for the filming of a science fiction super-production.
Combination of genders
The plan drawn up by “exfiltration” expert Toni Mendez required Hollywood’s collaboration.
To make the lie seem true, it was written about the film project in specialized magazines, press conferences were organized, the fictional production society even had a real office.
Details about the operation were kept secret for a long time, the film has been made from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck’s film is a unique combination of several genres.
On the one hand, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a so-called "caper movie", the story of an episode that turned out well, a deception (an example may be the Ocean's Eleven series).
The film combines the moods. On the one hand, we find well-documented sequences of Tehran. In the credits sequence, emblematic photographs of the time of events are shown, which were similarly portrayed in the film; there are not many differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical Hollywood scenes are somewhat lighter, marked by irony and a slight exaggeration.
And in addition, scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions: costumed men analyzing the situation at the negotiating table, in the corridors of the office, by phone...
Ben Affleck has managed to restart his career in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been mocked, has become a respectable director and his manner of acting has ceased to be the target of ironic comments.
Argo is his third feature film, after "Adi<0xC3><0xB3>s petit, Adi<0xC3><0xB3>s" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Thieves" (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck's first film in which the action takes place in the city of Boston, where he was raised.
Also, the sensitivity to capture the atmosphere of the place was a feature that placed the directors of old films above Hollywood standards.
And Affleck demonstrates this in Argo, where Tehran is “wheeling” in Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, in the reconstruction of the true events. The introductory sequence of the embassy take is impressive for its synoptic ability that, at the same time, conveys the emotion of the confusion and the lack of foresight that arises when, somewhere, the story takes a step forward.
Affleck and his collaborators achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (the impostor team in Tehran’s bazaar).
Too much action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that an explained story does not offer much in the cinematic sense of the most intriguing scenes.
Sometimes it adds something to the reality: here everything does not come out so elegantly (the scene where the crisis lurks at Tehran airport, the diversion of a call to America and the rampant search behind its runway become madness).
Argo’s weakness is the lack of control that arises from the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very funny role as Hollywood collaborators, although their characters deserved more space and are not, much less, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, Affleck's film loses a bit of dramatic plot, but it is a film that can be followed with moderate interest, valuing its realization and the retro style of a thriller that evokes the 70s.
But if it collapses, that will be difficult.
As an evocation of a real story and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of omnipresence and omniscience of secret services can be, it is enough.
Rules for balloon, banana and circus inflation
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which each year presents a survey on the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the contest on "the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the EU workshop".
"It occurred to us after the last event, the EU plans to approve a 40 percent quota of women in management positions in large European companies," said Pravo Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the nominated absurdities is, for example, the recent decision by the European Court of Justice to unify insurance policies between men and women.
So far, women have been taking advantage of better life insurance prices because they objectively pose a lower risk.
“Other incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year.”
The election will take place at the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the EU's controversial regulations is, for example, the mandatory addition of biocomponents to fuel that, as a result, harms the environment; another ban is the use of mercury thermometers for life only because they contain a small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive obscures the size of the cages of chickens, which has contributed to the considerable increase in the price of chickens.
There has been criticism of the factual prohibition of the use of the term "grease butter" or the removal of the classic light bulb from shops.
A quality banana should have a length of 14 centimeters.
The EU apparatus makes such decisions often under the pressure of one or another commercial or industrial lobby, whose petitions in Brussels are normally defended by some state or group of states (the Czech Republic, even with the threat of veto, claims the demands of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher-quality bananas should be at least 14 centimetres long in the EU and could not exhibit "abnormal curvatures".
The European Commission defended itself by saying that with this it only seeks to harmonise the national non-homogenized standards to date, which only complicate their commercialization.
Rules that refer to fruit and vegetables in the EU, despite opposition from some states, have been softened on the basis that the existing directive entails a waste of food.
The candidate to win the survey could be last year’s EU prescription according to which in inflatable balloons that are marketed it is mandatory to warn that children under the age of 8 are not allowed to inflate them without the supervision of an adult.
The U.S. referred here to an American study according to which, when talking about toys, balloons are the main cause of infant death by suffocation.
A similar restriction applies to the use of swabs by children up to 14 years of age.
Curious occurrences are born even in our country
Equally absurd is the regulation on European officials: anyone who has any official function in the EU cannot use the name of Macedonia. In order not to hurt the sensitivity of Greece, we must talk about FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovn<0xC3><0xAD>poplatky.com, in collaboration with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire, nominated in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of food supplies in the territory of a member state.
The EU determined the maximum volumes of food supplies that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry into the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the volume established for preserved mushrooms, which posed a threat of substantial fines.
The organizers of the survey were also interested in the occurrence of paying those countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy for the application of subsidies.
This kind of ideas did not arise in Brussels but in Prague.
“We are at a disadvantage because we don’t have the sea.
We are asking the European Union for compensation," said then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued with the fact that in our country a lot of grain was produced and, as a result of the so-called intervention purchases, the state had full warehouses and had to export.
According to Palas, since the Czech Republic is far from seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
In the end, the European Commission was willing to help the Czech Republic and organized a public tender for the purchase of grain from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The grant to receive a grant was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry for Local Development headed by Minister Pavel N<0xC4><0x9B>mec (US-DEU). Specifically, it is intended for the drafting of grant applications from Brussels.
EU: Rare prescriptions are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often subject to criticism, the EU's regulatory efforts and, moreover, more effective functioning and development throughout the Union deserve our recognition, according to several experts.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the collection of EU grants for projects that have nothing to do with deepening European integration, but which Member States have achieved in the budget negotiations.
The Czechs are also affected by the sensitive fibre, as are other countries in the Union, the fight for the right to the designation of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always emerged victorious from these struggles.
The Czechs, after six years of disputes with Germans and Austrians, successfully defended the designation of origin of the Olomouc requisition, but had to change its name to the national rum, whose tradition in our country dates back to the 19th century, and went on to be called "tuzem<0xC3><0xA1>k".
Only products made from sugar cane distillate can be called rum, but not those made from sugar beet.
In the official list of protected designations of origin of the EU, along with feta and gorgonzola cheeses known throughout the world, the Mazapan of the German city of L<0xC3><0xBC>beck or the ham of Parma, there are already, for example, the cookies of Karlovy Vary, the tent of Poho<0xC5><0x99>elice and T<0xC5><0x99>ebo<0xC5><0x88> and even the variety of hops.
As protected marshes of the EU, you can be proud of the Pardubice gingerbread and the Horice v Podkrkono<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD> barquillos.
People want me to save the republic, but I'm an amateur, Okamura says
Senator, how did you come up with the idea of running for president?
It's not about being a senator or president.
If in our country everything was fine, then I would not submit my candidacy.
But I can no longer bear to see how it is stolen in the last twenty years in our country, how thieves go unpunished, taxes are increased and the retirement age is increased.
He had no ambition to be a politician.
When I see something I don’t like, I try to come up with a solution to change it.
And since I’m already forty years old and my candidacy is independent, the only chance I have to change things is to run as a senator or president.
The Senate has already arrived, but soon after it has set on its way to the presidency.
Aren't you turning your back on those people who voted for him?
I always said that my candidacy for president depended on the results of the Senate elections.
I later specified that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not the function; the function is the tool with which I can make my own ideas come true.
That is why I need the greatest possible influence and the strongest possible mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in front of the television, but that we trample anyone who wants to initiate a change.
To this is added the media, which disparage you and confuse freedom of expression with freedom to lie.
I am said to have bribed journalists, which I have been an adviser to Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek.
Let's talk about your ideas.
It is presented to the presidential struggle with financial theses and criminal responsibilities of politicians and the declaration of ownership above twenty million.
For this you must change the law.
As president he does not have this competence and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have been part of a pressure group for the office of guidance to be recognized as autonomous work, and we have succeeded.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes up with a good proposal, whether from the right or the left, it is rejected on purpose and this affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have greater potential to gain the support of all parliamentary groups.
Without party cadres or dogmas, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is best for our country and apply it.
Is he a right-winger or a left-winger?
From the Czech point of view, I have the impression that people consider me more left-wing.
It doesn't matter to me, whether it's a little left or a little right.
What matters to me is that we move forward.
I don’t care if someone is on the right or the left, I want to unite people.
I always openly support any good solution, regardless of whether the proposal comes from the KS<0xC4><0x8C>M or the SDGs and, similarly, I will be against bad ideas.
It's a joke when you're told you're a populist.
But isn't he proving it with what he says?
When you create a business plan for the company, you also have certain goals and ideals.
And you're trying to get close to them.
There will be those who call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about already work in the world or well-known experts talk about them.
But without the support of parliament, there are only slogans.
And with that, he cannot survive in long-term politics.
Or do you think that if you address people and talk to them, you will get, for example, criminal and financial liability?
I have no choice.
Convince politicians, journalists and civil society and try to put them on my side to get it.
If elected president, there would be no problem in organizing a live television broadcast in which he would ask the leaders of parliamentary parties to legitimize criminal and financial responsibility for politicians, officials, judges and state prosecutors.
And eventually, they would have to communicate why they don’t want it.
If there is a strong character who points out disputes, you can put pressure on the political scene.
Let us take as a case the direct election of the president, which has been an achievement of public pressure.
At the same time I affirm that I am only an amateur, I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I try to find allies.
I have just started in politics and am trying to get as much support as possible for my program.
I try to push things forward myself, but in case it doesn’t work out, in six years I’ll leave it and go back to the private sector.
It sounds a bit like Okamura was going to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that with a person I do nothing, so I have visited a number of well-known personalities, in case they might be encouraged to submit their candidacy to the Senate.
I went to see Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, I have at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencov<0xC3><0xA1>, who brought to light the frauds with light heating oils.
I introduced myself on the basis that people are really dissatisfied, now I’m on the scale.
Sixty percent of the population did not go to the polls and, those who did, voted for representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the Senate, so it will be difficult to make changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of mayors or governors.
Are you considering forming your own party?
I haven’t considered it yet because I don’t have time for it, to check the impeccable past of each of the potential party members, nor do I have any money.
I have no money for the presidential campaign, in my transparent account there are only 20,000 crowns.
Don't you have any money?
He's talking about property statements, how's yours?
I estimate my private property at about $60 million.
In Prague I have a lot valued at 25 million, an apartment valued at ten million, another apartment valued at eight million, a collection of works of art worth ten million, an Aston Martin of about 3.5 million and a <0xC5><0xA0>koda Superb valued at one million, and in the account I have a couple of million.
By the way, I have an Aston Martin because it was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who drove this car, was gallant with women and, at the same time, fought against evils and injustices.
Is he driving an Aston Martin, his property is valued at $60 million and he has no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money on your side.
It's not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to be in debt?
I've already put $2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don’t have any sponsors shows that there isn’t too much interest in my program.
And I have no obligation to pay the campaign with money out of my pocket.
The expenses of the campaign essentially cover what I will receive as a senator’s salary.
But I couldn't live on it, for example, I couldn't afford my son's English school, which costs 30,000 kroner a month.
If I only wanted to make money, then I wouldn’t run as a candidate.
So you will continue with your business activity to be able to live?
Didn't you say before that you were going to quit this activity?
This has nothing to do with a higher salary.
As I promised, I have partly abandoned my activities.
For example, the representative of my travel agency will become my replacement in the spring.
The people would like it to be the Samaritan who would save the republic.
But I also need to live with something.
How much do you earn per month as an entrepreneur?
Between 200,000 and 400,000, which I'm still winning.
If I were president, then I'd quit business.

The MVRDV architecture studio shows that true adventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spijkenisse library and the newly completed "book mountain" - 2 photos
“I think the building is fun, it looks futuristic, and there’s finally something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passerby passing through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company located near the library, points out: “Furthermore, the building is beautiful.”
But I wonder why we need a library today.
We all have internet, tablets and e-books.
No one likes to go into those old-fashioned libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a bedroom town located at the gates of Rotterdam that hardly deserves a fleeting visit, boasts the dubious honor of having stood up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 has the lowest literacy rate in the Netherlands.
To counteract this shameful situation, a few years ago it was decided to contribute in some way to the general culture and copy the seven fictitious bridges that appear depicted on the euro banknotes in the form of decorated miniatures of reinforced concrete.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so it was that the politicians decided that there was only one way to improve the statistics: they had to build a library!
Winy Maas, from the Dutch architecture studio MVRDV, a master in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for fun and cynical buildings, took the subject with his usual serenity and appeared at the contest presentation in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury looked perplexed around him and shrugged, Maas proceeded to stack the books by size forming a pyramid and concluded his brief speech with the following words: "Dear fellow citizens:
Here you have it, my proposal for the Spijkenisse book mountain, the so-called <0x60>Boekenberg'."
Nine years later, the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million mountain rises in its intended place.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with an underground car park, a supermarket, a post office and a couple of residential and townhouse buildings.
In early November the mountain of books was awarded with the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also nominated for the "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small town with no history, which until now had nothing to offer but a postmodern pedestrian zone and an incredibly ugly town hall after whose white facade one would rather sense a central dairy, now has a work of contemporary architecture.
But most of all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Road to the Book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a cheese.
It is true that there is an elevator that transports us right to the center of this mountain massif, but the real lovers of space and reading do not use it, but prefer to merge with its topography every step of its climb to the top.
The fully glazed interior is bright and easy to embrace with the view, the annealed brick floor and elegant headlight unequivocally support the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
When you look up you can see the benches of the park, the dogs and the boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally bookshelves are arranged along the facade and in the center there is a huge dark room that is usually somewhat uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to step up the classic spatial configuration and take the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the mountain is very well taken advantage of: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the environmental education center and the maintenance room.
Special mention should be made of black shelves that assume the functions of wall cladding, parapet and railing at the same time.
The sight, the touch and the smell are strange.
Even the most day-to-day architects and civil engineers shake their heads when they hear about this unknown material.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” says Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And so it is like one day, in a Frisian farm, we come across the right by-product from agriculture.
For many years, in greenhouses and in the fields of the Netherlands, a plastic fabric of a few millimeters thick has been used as the basis for holding the roots of crops.
It is a cheap and efficient material.
This fine tissue lasts two seasons and is then discarded.
For the library this tissue was pressed, for the first time in such quantities, to obtain plates four centimeters thick.
With heat and pressure, the so-called agricultural plastic (KLP) changes color and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistant material that smells like a new car mix and sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the top of the mountain.
At the end of this continuous route of almost 500 meters around the mountain awaits us the reward: from the cafeteria you not only have a fantastic view of the city, but in it you can also enjoy tasty Dutch croquettes and their ficus planted in huge pots.
These create a pleasant atmosphere while maintaining the right atmospheric humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
“Although it’s hard to believe given its large glazed surfaces, this building is an exemplary project in terms of ecology,” says Trouborst.
The necessary heating and cooling is obtained from geothermal energy.
Despite the fact that the mountain of books is located under a huge pyramid of glass, even on the sunniest days the sun only shines for a few hours inside.
The huge wooden circles located transversely to the glass fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade serve to shade and absorb most of the sun’s rays.
This creates a comfortable indoor climate.
The rest is about automatic shutters.
Stefan Spermon, the skeptical IT worker, has already dared to set foot in the new library.
And Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Also, Chinese traditional medicine professor Cynthia Bogarde has visited the library. She qualifies the "Boekenberg" as the "late soul" of Spijkenisse.
The reason is that, on the occasion of the inauguration that took place a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to donate a book from their private collection.
In this way, it is intended to fill, for the moment, the optical gaps of a library that does not yet have its complete archive; currently it has 70,000 copies.
The concept has gone deep.
The shelves are full.
“There is nothing worse than a half-empty library,” says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our initiative now all the inhabitants have a certain connection with this building.
Everyone knows that your book is part of the library.
Even if it's just there to decorate.
In this way, the MVRDV study has achieved quite a success in that reigning discipline which in the specialized slang is known as "creating an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse has written a piece of the history of literature.
Regardless of how young and uneducated you may be.
Finally, a starting point for shaping your identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a more protagonist role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-Europe relations, this puts Berlin in a rather grim diplomatic position.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany hinted that it would vote against the proposal to grant the Palestinian territories the status of observer state of the United Nations.
However, Berlin finally abstained.
Why is that?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, because of the special relationship that unites the country with Israel, Germany must be careful.
But at the same time, I do not think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also refrained from establishing a no-fly zone.
This has finally been declared by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to take a clear stance when important international issues are at stake?
Yeah, that's right.
This is because he is currently reorienting his foreign policy, moving away from a policy led, so to speak, by the United States and focusing on a German foreign policy.
And what makes things even more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are at a crossroads.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but are not used to doing so.
I think they are still trying to figure out what their role will be, but they have already started the path towards a “normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy similar to countries like France or Great Britain.
What exactly does a "normal" foreign policy mean from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it comes to national interests, is willing to defend positions different from those of the United States or its European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy finds a strong motivation in economic policy, that is, in exports and in its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some extent different from those of other major powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the stance taken on the conflict in the Middle East and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf.
For this reason it must be careful not to alienate itself from Arab public opinion or from Arab elites.
This is important, of course.
But I wouldn’t give it that much importance since it’s not a totally one-sided relationship.
However, they do play a fundamental role in German considerations.
Has Germany undermined its relationship with the US by abstaining from voting on important decisions such as the Palestine vote?
I believe that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German position enjoys a huge degree of understanding.
For this reason, I do not believe that there has been such a drastic rupture as in the case of Libya.
Perhaps with this, Germany has managed to earn some respect.
After all, all this has only demonstrated that it is a country that they take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, there are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
Instead, the U.S. has clearly shown itself in favor of a veto.
Is there a difference of opinion between the U.S. and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of U.S. domestic policy.
I think the Obama administration is secretly showing a great deal of understanding toward the European position.
But because of the political situation here, it is clear that the government cannot publicly defend that position.
I believe that the true disparity of opinion does not really have the magnitude attributed to it.
If we look at the relationship between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not at all enthusiastic about the policy he is developing.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of its main partners in the EU, on the other?
I think that’s exactly what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course it would be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but that is not the case.
Therefore, they do not have the possibility of being part of a higher entity, but they must push things from their own position.
That is exactly what they are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will take a leading role in forcing Europe to adopt a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, either simply because of the relationship it maintains with Israel.
This has always been a tricky subject.
But I think the Germans are clear that they must play the role of an independent figure.
Does Germany see itself as an important international actor? Does Germany really want to take on a leading role?
Or do you still find it difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is always somewhat uncomfortable and, for obvious reasons, the country continues to struggle to play a more important role.
If we look at the euro crisis, for example, we see that every time Germany positions itself as a major player, certain anti-German sentiments are unleashed.
This is not easy for the Germans.
This is an old problem and no one wants to be surrounded by enemy countries.
Seen in this way, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It should show a receptive attitude towards the different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
The U.S. influence in European politics is diminishing more and more, but the EU is not covering that gap at the moment, so who is left?
The Germans will have no choice but to take on a more prominent role.
Even if they don’t like it, if they find it unpleasant or if it makes them an even more unpopular town, c’est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: when Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese brands
Armani is a globally known brand and Polo Ralph Lauren as well.
What is Armani Polo?
Behind this name is a name officially registered in China but that has nothing to do with the original companies.
However, it enjoys protection as long as the real eponyms do not file a lawsuit.
And even then it is not clear that they will be justified.
“Foreigners are finding it increasingly difficult to protect their trademarks in China,” said Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer for Taylor Wessing, a law firm specializing in protection rights violations in the Far East.
Every week a new case comes to my table.
Imitators simply add a couple of letters to be able to register their marks.
In this way, Gucci becomes Lu-Gucci and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also legally copied in the same way, as has happened to the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a filing cabinet in which he holds seats of the Beijing Trademark Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company applied to register the brand name Zegna DF Puma, an artificial name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
That the Chinese are world champions in copying and violating intellectual property rights is well known.
In the big cities there are large warehouses of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are of a different nature: on behalf of his clients, he fights against the fact that the Trademark Office officially grants Chinese companies the right to take advantage of a name that is already registered elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Ming Pai" or accompanying brand.
The word has its origin in the Chinese term "Bang Dakuan",
It refers to women who have “fished” a rich man.
Chinese authorities don’t feel guilty.
“It’s detrimental to the business, we have to fight it,” Pattloch demands.
“The brand makes water, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage to the image is enormous.”
The financial losses and procedural costs of the affected sectors are in the millions, especially in the case of emblematic luxury products.
According to data from market analysis firm CLSA, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing.
However, achieving the cancellation of registrations of dubious legality in the registration of trademarks is complicated and also involves a lot of money.
The process can take up to nine years and the outcome is uncertain.
Pattloch talks about cases in which the court dismissed a lawsuit because it had been so long that the name subject of the lawsuit had already become a “market reality.”
“If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay money to the plagiarist because the process has damaged his brand in China,” Pattloch says.
Sometimes this is the law of the jungle.
Some of the best-known cases have to do with graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler-Benz lost a lawsuit against construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that has recently been absorbed by the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
That is why today the Chinese can continue to use an emblem very similar to the Mercedes star.
Volvo’s buyer, Geely, initially used a white and blue logo that largely reminded BMW; the matter was settled in court and Geely had to modify it.
The clothing manufacturer Lacoste lost in China against imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore whose logo represented a crocodile looking in the opposite direction to the original.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing acknowledges that in 2010 they had difficulties due to the shortage of equipment and staffing.
Last year, however, “the work emergency situation returned to normal.”
In this way, the number of unprocessed claims has been reduced by 22%.
Almost 57,000 of these cases were resolved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81,500 claims are still pending resolution.
Fighting this costs a lot of money
As is usual in China, the figures are surprising.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
This would be a new record and means that China is leading the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth consecutive year, according to the brand office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logos, which amounts to 5.5 million in total.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan would have been pocketed for rights.
In other words, this means that on average each registration costs 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
Fighting this costs a lot of money, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg demonstrates.
For more than seven years, the group has been fighting in court against a Chinese imitator.
While the Germans have managed to stop the illegal manufacture of imitation car parts,
the imitator has managed to secure Chinese rights over the Freudenberg brand.
“We ourselves have caused this situation because in Germany surnames are not protected,” says Hanno Wentzler, President and CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office also dismissed the Munich appeal.
In the following two instances Freudenberg has been right, but the opposite party is still fighting today.
You have to be very careful
The case has now reached the doors of the High Court of Justice, where a decision is still pending.
Wentzler is confident that he can resolve the issue favorably and praises the professionalism of the courts.
However, he also states that “the procedure is extremely expensive, both in terms of money and time.”
It is difficult to estimate the internal costs; the business file has had to review files up to a hundred years old to be able to provide evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg offered the opposite party a “six-figure sum in euros” with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but it was unsuccessful.
“This shows how much we care,” Wentzler says.
The dangers lurking in the Far East threaten even to affect Europe,
in particular if the imitators are guaranteed rights there on unprotected trade marks.
Thus, a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather products.
Long ago the group abandoned this commercial sphere, however managed to prevent registration.
“You have to be very careful,” Wentzler says.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch recommend that German companies be extremely prudent when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark law, but what needs to be done is to "register also in China everything that may be susceptible to protection", as Wentzler points out.
Otherwise, the topic may be much more expensive than a simple registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the last assault of his particular battle, then he would have to pay the opposing party license rights by his own name, as Wentzler explains.
That or in the segment in question would drive us out of the market.
World AIDS Day: Dancing, Singing, Helping
Imbongi choir rehearsed in Heidelberg and AIDS orphans cheered in Swaziland
The story of a bond capable of exceeding much more than 8,733 kilometers away.
First you start with the dance: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, heel shoes and moccasins look for the compass on the parquet floor, and find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then do the voices of the singers (contralto, bass, tenor and soprano) slowly begin to rise, swirling, numbing and following each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old director, threatens to break out of his box almost as he tries to put his energetic and gentle gestures in order.
It is Monday afternoon and in the music room of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
Fifty singers, aged between 23 and 69, have also arrived, from the human geneticist to the householder.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each choir voice has a different text and also in a barely known foreign language: Zulu, a language spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in some areas of Swaziland.
Help for self-help
According to an estimate by UNAIDS, the United Nations AIDS programme, there are approximately 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40% of the population is already HIV-positive.
The Voices for Africa association has found sponsors in Germany for the 180 AIDS orphans in the town of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend high school.
For 15 or 20 euros per month you can sponsor a child.
This contribution will cover the school's tuition, uniform and guarantee you a hot meal a day at the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means "storyteller" or "panegirist" in Zulu.
In this room no one knows how to speak fluently this Bantu language, but they do know how to sing.
For ten years this choir has been rehearsing songs in this soft foreign language that sometimes manages to transport them to their place of origin: South Africa.
8,733 kilometers in a straight line from Heidelberg, in the northeast of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is a village called Esitjeni that depends on the voices of this German choir.
Forty percent are infected.
About 2,000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 no longer have parents because they have succumbed to AIDS.
Esitjeni is a small example of what affects Swaziland: the highest rate of AIDS infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
The population does not see circumcision with good eyes, a practice that has been shown to halve the risk of contagion.
More than 40% of Swaziland’s inhabitants are carriers of the immunodeficiency virus, and dying with just over thirty years has become commonplace.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered this hidden population, but what they saw above all were many children on the streets who lacked not only the protection of their parents, but of the main thing: food, clothing and training.
Without a school degree, the possibilities in a poor country are more than scarce.
In the beginning it was only the particular commitment of a few that made it possible for a child to go to school and enjoy a hot meal a day, all for a few euros.
However, a year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa" which has since professionally dealt with AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts about Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main diseases of sexual transmission?
Bacterial STDs include syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea.
The most common STIs of viral origin are AIDS, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The scabies and scabies are among the STDs transmitted by parasites.
What are the main groups of affected?
Syphilis and gonorrhea are more common in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five cases of syphilis in Germany originate from sexual contact between men.
In the case of heterosexual adults, the most common sexually transmitted diseases are chlamydia, trichomonas, human papilloma virus, candidiasis (fungal) and gonorrhea.
HIV infection among heterosexual adults in the country is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of new HIV infections are registered in this group.
Among young people, chlamydia infections are much more common than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people between the ages of 15 and 25.
In our country, the human papilloma virus is also added to the most common diseases among youth.
How has the number of infections evolved?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are subject to mandatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been on a downward trend since 2007.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This is one-tenth less than in the previous year.
What symptoms indicate that it is a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort when urinating, flow, abdominal pain, as well as blisters or warts.
They often do not cause pain or other symptoms and are therefore not detected.
How can one be protected?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100 percent protection.
Some pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through dirt and physical contact infections.
For this reason, experts recommend that you undergo regular medical examinations, especially if you change your sexual partner frequently.
If diagnosed early, most STDs can be cured and any late consequences can be avoided.
Through collaborations, donations and, last but not least, the fees that the choir charges for its performances throughout Germany, they get to collect quite a lot of money.
“In total, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” says Annette Lennartz, president of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-assured woman with leadership skills manages the money sent from Germany.
He takes care that the orphans find a good accommodation, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The "gogos", as the older women in Zulu are called, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans in charge, offer them a roof where to live and take care that children come to school every day punctually and dressed in their uniforms.
Those who have no one are under the protection of Khanyisile, a single woman who, like the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day, receives a salary from the association.
In addition, "Voices of Africa" has set up a sewing school, has built two chicken coops and, in collaboration with the American health organization PSI, has managed that many of the inhabitants of the village have undergone an HIV test.
This is not an obvious thing, since, despite how patent this disease is throughout the country, it is not usually openly talked about.
A King with 14 Wives
“AIDS is an absolute taboo,” says Annette Lennartz, “because it has to do with sexuality.”
Something strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his opulent lifestyle and fraught with excesses.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
This officially unaccepted way of life is largely responsible for the spread so fast that the HIV virus has experienced in recent decades.
But it is also due to the countless timers who travel the country from side to side and who take it wherever they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, “free condoms can be obtained anywhere, but these are barely used.
It’s another culture, here they only accept skin-to-skin contact.”
To foster cultural exchange, the Imbongi choir travels every two to three years through South Africa singing songs that speak of melancholy, fighting spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, songs that many in the southernmost end of the African continent still remember from the apartheid era.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a language of blacks; so much recognition not only brings with it an excellent atmosphere and a lot of joy, but has also managed to tear off a couple of tears from some other angry border soldier.
The trip always takes them to Esitjeni, where the singers visit the sponsored children.
Although this small population barely appears on the maps, in the valley of the Ezulweni River it is well known.
“Close to Esitjeni, there the light shines,” the locals say.
And after traveling the 8,733 kilometres straight back to Heidelberg to the rehearsal rooms on Bergheimer Street full of singers marking the passage, one realizes that it is also possible to see its light shining from there.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
The ice sheet is probably up to 20 meters thick.
NASA, the US space agency, has provided evidence of the existence of ice on Mercury.
Despite being the planet closest to the sun, there is also ice water there, as evidenced by three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe would have found evidence that an ice layer has formed in the area of the planet that is permanently in the shadow.
It seems that this one is at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters thick.
The water presumably comes from comets or, most likely, from asteroids that in their day collided with Mercury.
No one relates the discovery of ice to the possibility of life on the planet, according to the chief researcher of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help shed light on how water and other components of life have arrived in other areas of the solar system.
Completely unnoticed by the inhabitants of planet Earth, probes, telescopes and small robots like the Phoenix are dedicated to exploring the depths of the universe.
From time to time they send images to the Earth: small windows to the immensity of space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets that make up our solar system, in addition to the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which revolves around the sun just behind Neptune, according to the new definition of the term published by the International Astronomical Union in 2006 Ceres is no “planet”.
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as blue dots, although the most difficult to recognize is the pink color of the "newborn" stars.
This star-forming region, termed unromantic by W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Casiopea, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This image of an extinct star was taken by NASA’s Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is composed of the material that the star spits out in its extinction process.
In the massive Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light-years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope took this picture of the galactic star-forming zone.
The Pleiades, a group of stars also known by the nickname "The Seven Sisters", are an object visible to the naked eye in the night sky.
However, with the telescope you can better appreciate the colors.
The Helix Nebula appears as a huge red eye appears in this infrared image.
It is located 700 light years from the constellation of Aquarius.
Its similarity to a terrestrial continent has earned it the nickname of North America.
The combination of a normal photograph and an infrared image gives rise to a spectacular color.
This budding star was captured in all its glory for the first time by the Spitzer infrared detectors.
Saturn and its rings: how they originated remains one of the great unknowns of astronomy.

Depending on the hues, some images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula located several thousand light-years away in the constellation Sagittarius.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin term "trifidus" (divided into three), as dark lines of dust divide the hot heart of this star-forming zone into three lobes.
In the constellation of Ophiuchus, astronomers were able to photograph the clues to a cosmic carambola: 400 million light-years from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies swing toward each other to end up crashing irremediably.
This star formation was captured by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations can refer to it with the surname of Molinillo Austral.
The Hubble Space Telescope photograph shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation Cepheus.
The nebula located 1,400 light-years away is composed of dust particles whose size is between ten and one hundred times smaller than that of the dust particles that can be found in a house.
This image was created from optical images and X-rays taken by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes located 430 million light-years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, served as a model moment for NASA’s Hubble Space Telescope.
Scientists call the largest spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula lies the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
This star-forming zone constantly produces new stars.
In this star cloud, associated with the Rosetta Nebula, new stars are also continuously emerging; 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this galaxy so bright with a small black hole there is still no dust, only gas.
The researchers assume that it formed shortly after the big bang, when in the universe you could find mostly hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It appears that the telescope was invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galileo Galilei used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images they offer us are getting deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, specifically from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest in the world.
His mirror, in the picture, had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, USA, the Large Binocular Telescope is erected.
This allows you to observe the cosmos through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located on the island of La Palma is huge - only the mirror has a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Despite this, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of this more economical construction is that the telescope has a fixed lifting angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas also has a fixed elevation angle.
Its peculiarity is its enormous ability to collect light.
Despite having a comparatively smaller mirror diameter, this capacity is comparable to that of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo radio telescope (Puerto Rico), researchers can explore the universe for signs of extraterrestrial life.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI) can help anyone who owns a computer, providing processing capacity.

Here stands the Very Large Telescope, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can also illuminate the mid-infrared spectrum.
ESO will also host the so-called E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope).
Its primary mirror will span 42 meters and will be composed of a total of 1,000 reflective elements.
Until 2018 we are not expected to be able to take pictures.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes located on Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
These have two mirrors, each with a diameter of 10 meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which along with them explores the sky with the help of the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea is planned to build a new telescope of enormous proportions and with a mirror diameter of thirty meters.
This is an image of what it would be like.
However, the most important information in the cosmos comes from the hand of the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been sending images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets, mainly those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been located since the start of its mission.
The image shows the latest preparations for the launch of the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not launch into space aboard an Ariane 5 rocket until 2018.
The primary mirror of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the functions of this telescope will be to search for the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big bang.
The researchers start from the basis that there is also ice at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no conclusive evidence, as the Messenger probe revolves around the planet in an orbit much closer to the north pole.
For decades, radar measurements have pointed to the existence of ice on Mercury.
Thanks to the Messenger (2004) spacecraft, the first to orbit Mercury, scientists are now sure that this is the case.

The tour of the mountainous region of Talysh could be described as wild and romantic.
The minibus advances with great din through the winding road that passes alongside wooded hills, high-flowing rivers and the simple homes of local farmers.
Everything is green and juicy, one might even think that it is found in the Black Forest.
However, we are in the southernmost part of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
Here live the "talyshi", a town of which not much is known, except that they perfectly dominate Persian and Azerbaijani and are very long-lived.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small town boasts perhaps too massive an architecture designed in the Soviet era and that doesn’t seem to fit quite into such a picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists hardly get to this place, as the road from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too heavy.
To travel the 323 kilometers that separate the two urban centers, it takes eight hours because the road is one-way.
The amazing wealth that the country enjoys thanks to the oil of the Caspian Sea has not yet reached this hidden region.
However, Pilate Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May for the celebration of the Eurovision Song Contest and next year we will celebrate the Festival of the World's Oldest People," Fatulayeva said.
This is the director of the Museum of Longevity, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
Here is documented the life of eight dozen talyshis of the place who have exceeded 100 years of age. Fatulayeva points out a black and white image.
This is my grandfather, who lived 120 years.
One of his sons died at the age of 136.
However, the indisputable star of the museum is sheep shepherd <0xC5><0x9E>irali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov, who seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth certificate that certifies it.
And if we take into account that the oldest documented man lived 122 years, it seems that the age of M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov is quite suspicious.
“He was born in the region in 1805 and died in 1973,” Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, apparently still having time to conceive another daughter at the age of 136.
Has <0xC5><0x9E>irali M<0xC3><0xBC>sl<0xC3><0xBC>mov been wrong in his age for a couple of decades?
However, Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the advanced age of this Central Asian inhabitant.
"In some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan there are also people of very advanced age," says Scholz, "even in Sardinia there are many older men."
Due to the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific evidence about the age, especially when there is no civil registration.
Every day glasses full of melted butter
It is a fact that, surprisingly often, the inhabitants of the region around Lerik usually reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over 100 years of age.
Why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani tourist guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains that these are the special genes of talyshis.
The director of the museum, Mrs. Fatulayeva, believes instead that the cause lies in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it does not seem logical that precisely the high-calorie diet of talyshi, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom, in addition, drink a glass of melted butter daily, is so healthy.
In Cengemiran, a small settlement not far from the town of Lerik lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years of age he is relatively young for what is styled by these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
Sitting on the floor, he tirelessly moves a huge pot of butter.
Eight people live under a roof, including one of Mirzayeva’s sons and a daughter, both of whom became grandparents long ago.
They also play on one side to the other two small children.
In the kitchen they prepare tea for guests, a tea that they serve in typical glasses with a rounded shape.
Mirzayeva's teeth are white and perfectly aligned and under the handkerchief hides two long dark blonde hair braids that her son proudly discovers.
I have always washed my hair with milk, so it has never fallen off and has retained its color.
“I’ve never used a shampoo either,” Mirzayeva says.
Pension is enough to live on
He has always eaten only what he produced on his own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and peas.
I’ve never been to a supermarket in my entire life.
Then she tells us about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was the post-World War II era.
However, everything returned to its course when the "beloved father", Heydar Aliyew, took control of the situation.
This kind of propaganda sounds rare in the mouth of an older woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the cult that is professed to the father figure of the nation, who runs his country as a dictator, knows no limits.
He remained in power until 2003, when he gave the witness to his son Ilham.
At least the elderly in Azerbaijan do not know what poverty is.
Mirzayeva charges 230 manat (about the same amount in euros) as a monthly pension, an amount with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps Mirzayeva’s son is right: “In our culture the elders are very respected.”
They live in a large family, are loved, receive all the necessary care and are happy.
As if this wasn't reason enough to stay alive for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression "Human Rights"
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Demonstrations that rival each other in Cairo highlight the tremendous division the country is plunged into.
The future constitution, with Sharia as its basis, is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president did not shy away from patheticism.
“We have to overcome the transition.
And that that happens is my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said on public television.
His speech was addressed to all the people, especially the Christian Copts, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims and the secularists.
All of them, plunged so far into a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the banks of the Nile by the grace of the powerful Muslim community.
As Mohammed Morsi explains, almost apologizing, he has had to temporarily annul the powers of the Constitutional Court and expand his powers "in order to save the revolution".
However, neither the Egyptians nor the entire world know very well what this 61-year-old engineer with a doctorate degree from the University of Southern California really wants to save.
Do you want to deprive the judiciary of its power?
In fact, the 234 articles, the passage of which has been forced by a constituent assembly composed of 100 predominantly Islamist members at a 15-hour nightly meeting, are truly worrisome.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does that mean for “principles”?
This was and still is open to interpretation and it seems that the Islamists will take advantage of this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal maneuver that it has paired, to impose a stricter interpretation of sharia.
This is at least what a new article suggests: in all matters relating to sharia it is mandatory to consult Al-Ashar University, the country’s most important Islamic institution with great power throughout Sunni Islam.
It doesn’t have to be that way, but this can mean that the clergy would control the legislation, which – in fact – would result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft constitution is open to interpretation.
What is also problematic is that it intends to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak’s dictatorship these courts served to exert a harsh crackdown on the opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the draft states, the state must protect “the true essence of the Egyptian family” and “promote its morals and values.”
It is such an imprecise formulation in legal terms that with the help of this article state institutions could even control the contents of cinematography and literature.
To be clear, this is nothing but censorship.
Of course, no article explicitly establishes equality between men and women.
Instead, another forbids offending or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his legacies.
However, it is not clear what an offense is and how it should be sanctioned.
Equally doubtful is the formulation that prohibits "offense to people"
Is a caricature of the president or a joke about a lawyer enough?
Question of interpretation, like many other things in the draft that has been presented to Morsi for his signature and that, according to his words, "very soon" will be presented to the Egyptians to be submitted to a referendum.
"The Revolution is Back"
For weeks the opposition has been closing ranks against the superiority of Islamists.
Ten thousand people gathered in unusual harmony on Friday afternoon in Tahrir Square in Cairo and vowed to make the Act fail before it could come into force.
“The revolution is back and we will end up winning,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who ranks third in the presidential election lists.
The Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El-Baradei, said the draft constitution should be “in the dustbin of history.”
Through Twitter he accused Morsi’s followers of wanting to lead a “coup d’etat against democracy.”
"When he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said opposition leader Jasser Said.
“We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expiated,” opposition politician Chaled Ali was quoted as saying in the Egyptian media.
And several judges announced that they did not wish to oversee the referendum, so it would not be considered valid.
"The Qur'an is our Constitution"
For its part, the well-organized Muslim community called for a counter-demonstration, perhaps not in Tahrir Square, but after a prayer on the other side of the Nile, before the University of Cairo.
Many women covered with a veil and supporters of the Salafists took part in it, shouting: "The people demand the application of the divine law."
They demanded that Morsi "clean up the country," while proclaiming that "the Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for the sovereignty of the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have caused a situation similar to that of a civil war.
It is clear that Mursi’s supporters did not want to risk such a thing happening.
The Muslim brothers claimed that both those who oppose the draft constitution and its supporters would have expressed their views loud and clear.
Now would have been the time to let the people decide in the polls what direction the country should follow.
In this sense, it seems that the draft of the Islamists has secured the majority.
"The expression 'Human Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is furious with this forced constitutional process that should have actually lasted until February and included all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended the Muslim brothers when they were detained in prison or had to face trial during Mubarak’s dictatorship.
Not because he shared his ideology, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this reason he was beaten, condemned and imprisoned.
"And now the expression 'Human Rights' does not even appear in the new constitution," he laments in a conversation with the newspaper "Welt am Sonntag".
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers of the state led to his resignation.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the rules of the democratic game and will lead Egypt to a new dictatorship.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, what the president has done is abolish it,” Saeda laments.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels abandoned, also by the international community, which observes the ideological struggle that is taking place on the banks of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
This could turn against you.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: “You’re conceiving a monster you can’t control.”
The Norwegian rakfisk: the most smelly fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards, not only of Europe but of the world.
Is it possible that the country’s success has something to do with its greed for an extremely foul-smelling fish?
Take a series of overly-cured cheeses.
Put them in the middle of a mountain of dirty and wet football clothes.
Leave it there for a week.
You will then be able to smell the paralyzing aroma of rakfisk, one of Norway’s delights.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that smell, always present, floats in the air.
The rakfisk is a salted trout that is fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how bad-smelling you prefer it.
As it gets dark and it gets colder, the Norwegians flock to a festival held here in Fagernes, dedicated to this most, so to speak, captivating dish.
“You eat raw and then you drink a glass of aquavit from a drink,” says Havard Halvarsen, a city firefighter who is also known as the “General of Rakfisk,” who is in charge of organizing the festival.
Everywhere we see people eating this fish that is stored in small cubes and drinking from a drink important amounts of the drink.
“Some people like aquavit more than rakfisk,” Havard says.
The drink can kill the smell.
I'll try some pieces.
If you can avoid passing it near the nose, it’s not bad; it’s not much different from a portion of sushi that’s traveled a few miles by bus.
The rakfisk is a product that comes from a very different time, in which poverty hit Norway and in which, before refrigeration existed, the fish was stored during the autumn immersed in water and salt in hermetic barrels.
Later, in the middle of winter, when it is already well fermented, it is taken out and, obviously with the senses inactive due to alcohol, it is eaten.
Just a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and mostly emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is growing rapidly; more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a complete system of social services.
A stream of people from Sweden, the old rival and even not so much richer than Norway, comes to this country to work.
The rakfisk is considered something important, an essential, though rather smelly, part of Norway’s past.
It is among the most expensive dishes you can buy.
But, in fact, everything is expensive. A beer can or a sandwich cost you 10<0xE2><0x82><0xAC> ($14) each.
Norway doesn’t usually appear on the international news agenda and most Norwegians like it that way.
Here people are still reluctant to pronounce the name of Anders Breivik, the far-right racist who shot and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, they refer to the shooting as “the July 22 event.”
It is very difficult for the Norwegians to believe that in their peaceful country one of their own was capable of committing such cruelty and murder.
After much of Norway’s current wealth lies the growth, since the early 1970s, of one of the world’s largest oil and gas industries.
“But oil isn’t the only reason we’re doing so well,” says Anna, our waitress, as she walks past rakfisk trays and that, with her long blond hair and striking blue eyes, represents the image of Norwegian well-being.
"We are, as you say, wise people."
His English, like most people in this country, is impeccable.
"We don't like bragging, we don't like showing off."
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution; everything except a small percentage of the money from this industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
While everyone was wasting money they didn’t have during the years leading up to the global financial crisis, Norway kept the wallet tightly closed.
“As long as we can ski in winter and hike in summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
"And eat rakfisk," he adds with a shrug.
I'm in the snow doing tail to eat something; I've had enough rakfisk.
Now a moose burger is definitely something different and quite succulent to taste.
But at night, that stinking fish comes back.
The hotel where I stay is one of the many places where a rakfisk dinner is held in which diners vote the best fish, or perhaps the one that most tests the nostrils.
A TV has connected live with a presenter who wears a birdie and is surrounded by rakfisk dishes.
It looks like the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What are your scores for the best fish up there in the mountains, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here's our score, Havard."
There are laughter and applause.
A man falls from the chair, perhaps defeated by the aquavit.
Or maybe they're the vapors of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto faces a tough start
As Mexico’s incoming President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto prepares to take office, BBC correspondent Will Grant looks at the challenges the new president will face and the different expectations of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is especially bad right now.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, is already congested by itself, a steel fence has been installed since Monday that cuts off several of the main roads leading to the city and is causing enormous chaos on the roads.
The aim, however, was not to prevent workers from reaching their workplace, but to prevent protesters from reaching parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, will receive the presidential band and take over the nation’s management.
He faces a complicated task.
Mexico has been getting good economic results during the outgoing government of Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, but the country is immersed in a war against drug trafficking that has already claimed some 60,000 lives in six years.
“My government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence,” Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
“I’m going to propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve that goal.”
Before colluding with the U.S. president, Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a’s previous political experience was as governor of his home state of Mexico.
A very populous and rapidly growing state, surrounding the capital; opinions about the new leader are divided in this territory in which he used to move.
A sincere man
In the bucolic city of Valle del Bravo, for example, you are fondly remembered.
Its residents attribute to it the merit of the growth of tourism on the site and the construction of infrastructure.
To get to the city you can drive along one of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto’s new roads, which is a huge improvement compared to the cracked and bumpy roads that were rehabilitated.
You can also see plaques bearing his name at the entrance of a modern sports hall and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We are confident that he will be able to make real and lasting change," says his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, MP of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto's party, the PRI.
“Particularly, in terms of security and the economy, we look forward to the interesting and real change our country so badly needs.”
After an unbroken 81-year period in power, the PRI was ousted by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace in Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
It also rejects the opposition's lack of substance rating of the new president.
“He is a very sincere man, very committed and with an excellent vision of the country.
He is a fantastic statesman and, above all, a person who knows how to listen.”
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression many people have about their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
Hidden under elevated highway sections is, in many ways, a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
Earlier this year, the military was asked to intervene to help in the fight against drug gangs operating in neighborhoods and violence against women is especially serious.
In a desert plot, located next to a garbage dump, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left abandoned in just the last two years.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was the governor, a much higher rate than Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, unfortunately famous for its violence and a place that is synonymous with the murder of innocent women.
Critics of Mr. Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto say, at best, that he did not know how to address the problem of femicide while in office.
The most critical accuse his administration of making the eyes fat.
In a concrete house, typical of the deteriorated neighborhood, Irinea Buend<0xC3><0xAD>a has to make efforts to contain the tears while showing me photographs of her deceased daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
However, her family believes that her partner murdered her.
“When I got to his house, it looked like his body had been cleaned,” recalls Mrs. Buend<0xC3><0xAD>a.
"There were signs that she had been beaten and rigor mortis had already appeared."
While her mother tells the story, a photograph of Mariana looks from the walls, next to a cross in which a single word is read: Justice.
However, that’s exactly what the family says it has been denied.
“The state authorities have treated me as if I were an old gossip, a troublemaker, a complainer.
What they want is for you to simply accept what they say and shut up.”
“But that can’t be the case when there have been so many irregularities and so much negligence,” he says.
The presidential band that President Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto will receive on Saturday will be accompanied by a huge responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to give them priority during his term.
“I hope he’s the same kind of president he was when he was governor,” says PRI deputy Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
However, that is exactly what the families of the victims of Neza City most fear.
Bradley Manning did not report abuse, prosecutors say
Prosecutors try to deal with Bradley Manning’s allegations of abuse during his time in prison
The trial focuses on the Manning period at Quantico Military Prison in Virginia
The defense wants the case dismissed on the grounds that Manning’s imprisonment was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to prove Friday that Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest leak of confidential information in U.S. history, missed multiple opportunities to report the mistreatment he now claims he suffered while under military detention.
During the interrogation that the prosecution conducted Manning at a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Attorney General Ashden Fein claimed that records of the weekly visits of unit officers that Manning received during nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, show no complaints about the treatment he received.
The interrogation, which took place during a hearing held following the defense’s request for the case to be dismissed because his imprisonment had been harsh and had already meant enough punishment, came a day after Manning testified that he had thought of committing suicide while in detention.
The army intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was the source of the information.
At Friday’s hearing, Fein reviewed with Manning the forms officers filled out after visits to Manning during his arrest at Quantico Military Prison, where he was held in maximum-security detention from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers would have asked questions to Manning and noted his answers.
When Fein asked about the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that he had rated the treatment given to him by the locksmiths as "excellent" and the treatment received on the premises in general as "very professional".
The forms do not show any allegations of ill-treatment, even though officers asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers who visited him had told him about those issues and indicated that they would be dealt with, but that they did not record those issues in the registry.
"They were writing 'no incident' (after talking about the problems) but this doesn't necessarily mean I wouldn't have mentioned any problems," Manning said.
The judge, Army Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he had not reported the treatment he received during the January 2011 meeting with a board tasked with examining the suicide intentions he had expressed on a form months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to obtain the reduction of the “injury prevention” regime under which he was under.
The military said they had put him under that restrictive regime, which is one degree below the surveillance for possible suicide, to ensure his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the senior state to know that I was okay and (wanted) to stop being under injury prevention... so that I could enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better quality of life,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to a military prison at a naval base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and that on one occasion he lost consciousness due to the heat.
He said that the fact that he was not allowed to know what was happening to him or what was happening in the outside world was very distressing.
“My world was reduced only to Camp Arafjon, to that cage,” Manning said Thursday.
“I thought I was going to die in that cage.”
Manning claimed that, once transferred to Quantico, he spent most of his days in a small cell, at least 21 hours and often 23 hours without company.
Manning said he was only allowed to have a mattress, a blanket, some flip-flops, some clothes and his glasses.
He explained that he was trying to move all the time, as it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
Manning claimed that he always had a light coming from outside pointing to his eyes while he was sleeping.
He said that if the guards could not see his face when he turned at night, they would wake him to turn again.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint in January 2011 about Manning’s treatment.
Manning was transferred to Fort Leavenworth Military Prison in Kansas in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation he had made in Thursday’s statement that, after being forced to sleep naked one night in his Quantico cell, he was forced during a morning recount to stand naked in front of the jailers and other inmates.
Manning had testified that he had never been given the opportunity to cover himself with the blanket during the count.
During the judge’s interrogation on Friday, Manning said he deduced from the order given to him by the bailiff that he should drop the blanket he could have covered himself with, but acknowledged that no one had ordered him to drop it.
Manning testified Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the night before because of an attempt to prove to an officer that he did not pose a danger to himself.
Manning claimed that he had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his underwear or his flip-flops to self-harm but had not.
Manning testified that that night they had removed his underwear, flip-flops and glasses from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences he went through during his time in prison and drastically reduce his sentence should he be convicted on the war council, which is scheduled to begin early next year.
The defense said it plans to have Manning plead guilty to minor offenses and defend other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is expected to resume this weekend and prosecutors are expected to argue that conditions of detention were warranted.
The Pentagon has maintained that Manning was held in accordance with the rules of application to any detainee who is in maximum custody at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include cooperating with the enemy, illegally causing the publication of information on the Internet, leaking national defense information, and theft of property or public records.
If convicted of all charges, he could face life in prison.
My Mexican-American Identity Crisis
He claims that many were forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to criticize those who left; says they remember Mexicans from those difficult times
Navarrette comments that Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
On a recent trip to Mexico City, he had barely gone down the esplanade and arrived at the immigration processing area and was already totally confused.
Some posters pointed the way to two lines: one for "Mexicans" and one for "Foreigners".
I stayed there for a few seconds not sure where I was going.
Growing up in Central California, my whole life I've been called "Mexican."
It’s ethnic tachygraphy, just as my friends in Boston refer to themselves as “Irish” or my friends in New York call themselves “Italians.”
Later, I decided on "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandfather’s homeland, tachygraphy or scripts were not necessary.
He was simply American.
I speak Spanish. Good enough to handle myself during an interview in this language.
But I don’t have the vocabulary level of a native and I can’t get rid of my American accent.
So I took my U.S. passport and put myself in the queue of foreigners.
I thought about that time this week when Mexico’s president-elect, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda of the day, as always when the leaders of these two countries meet, was: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, one of the reasons why at the moment it is so likely that a Mexican will stay in Mexico and venture into the United States.
He wants to partner with the United States and Canada and create a European Union-style trade bloc in North America.
In addition, Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto promised to continue fighting drug cartels in Mexico, although he gave no details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never remember that in 1848 the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to cede half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans, who think in centuries, not minutes, the elements that remind them are everywhere.
So, the moment a U.S. official says anything that carries the slightest criticism of Mexico, you start to hear complaints, both in the press and among the Mexican elite, about how Americans are usurping the sovereignty of their neighbors.
And the children of Moctezuma are at war.
And yet, for Mexico, the relationship that really poses a challenge is that they have with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Are we talking about anger?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for whom the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason there are so many people of Mexican descent living in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, at some point in our family tree, there was one person, maybe the father or mother or any of the grandparents, who was locked in the door of opportunities in Mexico and had to march north.
And most of the time that person fit a certain profile: dark skin, a low level of studies, coming from a poor people, etc.
We are their descendants and we are loyal to them.
Not in Mexico.
And, even though we may be living the American dream now, having gone to good schools and had good jobs, we can never lose sight of what we are living is that, the American dream, and not the Mexican one.
Sometimes our identity may not be clear, but our loyalty is.
It's for the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many of the Mexicans belonging to the elite of the ruling class do not like us.
The feeling is mutual.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look us over their shoulder as if we were in a lower category that is not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough and our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
In his view, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn’t failed in Mexico, they wouldn’t have gone.
And now we would not find ourselves trapped behind this silk curtain, living well in the United States but still as lonely souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and came legally to the United States when I was a child, reminds me that there is this friction between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because the former know more solidly who they are and the latter this annoys them.
Although she is a citizen of the United States, she is considered part of both countries.
Meanwhile, many Mexican-Americans I know feel like they’re not part of either.
We love listening to the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you are not rooted in any of them.
In Mexico they see us as Americans.
In the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
Now, to complicate things even further, as I learned during my trip, some Mexican leaders and some intellectuals want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want Mexican-Americans to work as improvised “ambassadors” of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would tell our fellow Americans how fantastic it is to visit that country and we would pressure political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yeah, sure.
That's not gonna happen.
There's too much rancor.
And with wage inequality, rampant corruption and drug violence, many of us aren’t so sure it’s a fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're going to be left alone with this idea, friends.
It's fair.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, then they have to accept the fact that some Mexican-Americans are still resentful of how their relatives were treated a lot less time ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may well be an unlikely basis for peace
Will there ever be a lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed that seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
Amid the useless and habitual discussions about who started first, piles of buildings have been reduced to rubble; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed and, for the first time, rockets from Gaza have fallen near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But even though Israelis and Palestinians seem to be anchored in their ancient conflict, everything around them in the Middle East is changing.
The Arab spring has left everything to pieces whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have been trapped in the regional turmoil.
Perhaps this will make your struggle even more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons to think that their deadly stalemate could unravel.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism currently seems very difficult to justify.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21, this week’s clashes have reinforced the hawks on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has ruled Gaza since 2007, will claim to have forced the Israelis to withdraw, even though Gaza has received a good beating.
And despite killing some of its leaders and putting pressure on Gaza’s 1.7 million people in one of the most miserable and populated corners of the planet, Israel has not been able to end Hamas.
In fact, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, the other part of Palestine currently ruled by its ruthless rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
In addition, Hamas leaders could come to the conclusion that time plays in their favor.
Since Islamists have been gaining influence throughout the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that had previously been the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has embraced the Hamas cause, as has Qatar, one of the Gulf’s richest and most dynamic states.
Exhilarating Hamas members say the Islamist crescent is encircling Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hezbollah militia party dominates, through Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist tendency could overthrow Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies are threatening the king.
Especially on the southern flank of Israel, the growth of the Muslim Brotherhood led by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, by far the most populous and fundamental of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, did not have much time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim Brotherhood are Hamas’s cousins and its leaders depend more on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may emerge as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
In the meantime, Israel’s hard wing will draw the opposite conclusion.
As far as the military issue is concerned, they have put Hamas in its place.
Israel’s Iron Dome anti-missile system has proven its effectiveness and many of Hamas’ missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will sleep quieter... for a while.
As for diplomacy, the United States is stronger than ever; many European countries also blamed Hamas for initiating the latest wave of violence.
Above all, Israel has prospered, especially under Benjamin Netanyahu, a prime minister who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets fired from Gaza have killed some 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicide bombers, in part thanks to the barrier that corrodes the West Bank, the main piece of a territory aspiring to become a state of Palestine, and protects Jewish settlements that continue to increase despite the illegality of international legislation.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Likud party has joined an even tougher-line group led by Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to the January 22 election, is in a good position.
Why pamper those twisted Palestinians by giving them a state of their own?
If they really ruled the West Bank, wouldn’t they fire rockets like their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to have them behind that wall and give them a good blow if they raise their head.
The hard wing may be imposed, although the Arab spring could alter its calculations.
Although Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere do not have much appreciation for Israel, their priority will be to address internal difficulties.
Israel’s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
Starting a war with the area’s superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments improve their economies.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to bring about a ceasefire is a good hope and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis, too, should think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving Palestinians of their right to self-determination means creating a dustbin that will one day explode in the territories occupied by Israel, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The repression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state and the demographics are worsening as the Arab population increases.
The bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an ever-increasing diplomatic toll.
Both sides need a push from people outside the conflict.
The solution remains that preached by sensible people on both sides, the majority of the outside world and this newspaper: two states and the cession of territory by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small in the short term, is that the ceasefire will give a little more impetus to the outsiders who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must start curbing the entry of weapons into Gaza, along with Turkey and Qatar, is in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, with exchanges of land and a shared Jerusalem.
Non-Arabs should also pressure Hamas and Fatah to unite.
That would contribute more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual state category at the UN.
Mr. Obama also has an important role in getting Israel to the negotiating table.
During his first term, he failed to present his own plan for peace.
Again in the White House, he seems equally reticent to devote his attention to her.
This attitude is a deplorable vision of the future.
A stable Middle East is of vital interest to the United States.
This implies a peace agreement between Israel and Palestine.
The General Tobacco Packaging Act comes into force in Australia
Warnings about the risks of smoking and parts of the body with diseases shine on boxes of a green off, which are the same for all brands of tobacco
Australian tobacco and generic packaging law, a pioneer in the world, comes into force and replacing the logos and colors of the brands with a wrapper of an olive green shutdown, horrific images of body parts with diseases and representations of sick children and babies for being children of smoking parents.
With the exception of the various images and health warnings, the only difference between the boxes, mandatory since Saturday, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small font type.
It is the strictest regime in the world applied to tobacco packaging.
The federal government of Australia says the goal is to deter young people from smoking by eliminating the traits that make this habit glamorous.
It relies on studies that show that if a person has not started smoking before the age of 26, there is a 99% chance that they will never do so.
“It can be seen that children, even from a very early age, understand the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through its brand,” said Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that showed, for example, how girls related the logo of a crown to the idea of being a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest rates of smokers in the world and these changes will not affect the profits of multinationals too much, other countries are considering similar measures.
The tobacco industry has exerted enormous pressure against the law.
Tobacco companies said the law would encourage the black tobacco market, in which cigarettes would be cheaper and more accessible.
“The legislation will have serious unintended consequences,” said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco in Australia.
It will increase the amount of tobacco that counterfeiters from China and Indonesia will bring to sell on the streets of Australia.
Others say their business has benefited from the passage of the law.
Sandra Ha, of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, said the demand for silicone pipettes and covers to cover the unpleasant images of the boxes had skyrocketed almost from scratch two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost a rejection of the law in the Supreme Court.
Ms. Ha stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale establishments and that she was expecting more stocks.
"For us it's a good deal."
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks among the demographic sector to which the plan is aimed.
After a series of Australian laws banning television advertising and sports sponsorship and forcing most sellers not to put cigarettes in sight, tobacco marketing has gone online.
Australia has banned internet advertising to local businesses and websites, but cannot restrict it to foreign pages.
“If you market tobacco and you only have this small window to promote your products, the online space is the most compelling place to be,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in reviews of brands from “walking citizens” published on social networking websites such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
One wonders if it’s just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has taken the trouble to make a video or if some marketing company is behind it all.
The British American Tobacco of Australia indicated that the industry focuses more on what the new regulations imply than on marketing.
The industry has even come to pay for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to refuse the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that trade is being restricted unfairly, even though none of these countries has a significant volume of trade with Australia.
The WTO is likely to issue a resolution in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries that are considering similar tobacco packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada became the first country to introduce the requirement to include images in the boxes.
They are currently mandatory in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India, tougher laws are being considered.
In Australia, many smokers are challenging.
“The pictures don’t affect me.
I just don’t pay attention to them.”
“Take the cigarette and save the package,” says Victor El Hage as he buys a package with the image of a tumor in his mouth.
“Honestly, there’s only one reason I would quit smoking: for my daughter.”
James Yu, manager of the King of the Pack pond in central Sydney, points out that uniform boxes make it more difficult for him to place them on the shelves.
“It usually took an hour to unwrap a delivery; now it takes four,” Yu says.
“The government should have totally banned tobacco and then, it’s, okay, it’s over and we shut down the store,” he says as he raises his hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it’s not so bad to get a little bored
During the Thanksgiving holidays this year, I unexpectedly had to spend five hours at an airport because the plane we were flying on suffered a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
So I had a lot of time to think about boredom.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport waiting for a flight to arrive is pretty boring, even if you have the means to be entertained, like books, magazines or iPhones, without forgetting duty-free shops.
But more and more academics and child development experts are praising the benefits of boredom.
According to them, it’s okay that both we and our children get bored from time to time.
Boring forces the brain to look for interesting options and may encourage creativity.
Since most of us are currently connected to this or that screen, we don’t experience the benefits of boredom.
So, should we accept boredom in a good way?
Yes, sir.
And no.
But, we will talk about it later.
First, like many people, I assumed that now that we have more time for leisure, boredom would be a relatively recent phenomenon.
But, as Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" published in 2011 by Yale University Press, says, it is not.
“In fact, the history of boredom is very long,” he says.
In the walls of Pompeii there are graffiti in Latin on boredom dating back to the 1st century AD.
We also need to think about how we define boredom.
“The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in very different ways,” says John D. Eastwood, a psychology professor at the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining the published research and putting the idea before a discussion group of 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined boredom as the experience of “desiring, but not being able, to participate in an activity that fills you.”
He claims that the difference between boredom and apathy is that the person does not do something but wants to do it.
He points out that with apathy there is no desire to do anything.
The main experience of boredom, he says, is “the alteration of the process of attention, associated with a low mood and a feeling that time passes slowly.”
Boring can sound awfully similar to depression.
However, Professor Eastwood says that while they may be related, people who are bored tend to see the problem as a matter of the environment or the world, while people who are depressed consider the problem to be their own.
Sometimes we think we’re bored, when what really happens to us is that we have trouble concentrating.
In his study “The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention,” published in the September issue of Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues referred to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a journal article.
Some groups listened in the adjoining room to an all-volume television show that kept no relation, others listened to it with the low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group that listened to the program with the low volume showed more boredom than the other two groups; they found it difficult to concentrate, but they were not sure why and attributed it to boredom.
“When you try to focus on a difficult or interesting task, the distraction can lead to boredom,” said Mark J. Fenske, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study’s authors.
“On the other hand, when you’re doing something boring, like spotting defective parts on a manufacturing line, music that distracts you can help you not get bored.”
“In fact, we currently know that moving or doing scribbles, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually help fight it, as they make that person physically more alert.”
“Research shows that those children who are allowed to move learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to be still,” says Professor Fenske.
We all know what it’s like to get bored at some point: the delay of an airplane, a monotonous speaker, an especially boring movie.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To help measure it, some researchers developed a “boring trend scale” in the 1980s.
The scale includes issues like “many of the things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous” and “there are so many things that interest me that I don’t have time to do it all.”
Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, says that using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored more often than girls, and specifically need more external and more varied stimulation.
But, in general, teenagers are a type of group that gets bored quite easily.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day through a search.
He found that 32 percent of teens said they were bored while in school or doing homework, while 23 percent said they were bored when not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of parents said they were bored.
Professor Larson said he did not know whether the current percentages of boredom, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said what he did know was that “adolescents are a period in which boredom reaches its highest levels,” largely because both children and teens are not given much control over what they want to do.
So, back to my question from the beginning: is it good to be bored?
Sometimes it is not, because, taken to the extreme, it can cause us to expose ourselves to absurd physical risks, such as betting or falling into the consumption of substances as a method of combating it, as research shows.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers talk about the connection between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been studying this issue for more than two decades.
“Busty is the brain’s way of telling you that you should be doing something else,” says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn’t always know what’s most appropriate.
If you are bored and use that energy to play the guitar or cook, that will satisfy you.
But if you watch TV, it may satisfy you in the short term, but not in the long term.
“So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he may not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to entertain himself or to dose himself,” says Professor Fenske.
And “that ability to dose applies to other situations,” he says.
Your child not only learns to entertain themselves, but learns to control themselves better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to praise boredom.
But we shouldn't be too critical of him either.
Rather, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant noise of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
“As we see it, we need to get bored more, but boredom is too distressing and unsettling a desire to relate it to something worthwhile,” he says.
He points out that what people are really looking for is a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
“In an environment where we’re constantly overstimulated,” he says, “it’s hard to find ways to focus our attention when the noise stops.”
Colorado: No Book of Instructions for the New Marijuana Use Act
Anthony Orozco, a 19-year-old student at a community college and soccer player in southeastern Colorado, is facing criminal proceedings for something that will soon be legal across the state: possession of marijuana stones and a pipe he used to smoke it.
Orozco says that one day in September, he and some friends drove through Lamar, in the plains near the Kansas border, when they were stopped by police.
Police found marijuana in the car and some time later Orozco received a subpoena for possession of drugs and related items (minor offenses each involving a $100 fine) informing him of the date of the trial.
“They treat us like criminals,” Orozco says.
And they are?
In the weeks of uncertainty following Colorado’s vote to legalize possession of small amounts of recreational marijuana, the response in hundreds of minor drug possession cases depends less on the law than the location.
Hundreds of minor marijuana possession offenses are being overturned both here and in Washington State, where a similar measure was passed.
Police departments have stopped filing charges against those over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be legally approved once the law comes into force in the coming weeks.
But Colorado’s most conservative district prosecutors have pledged to move forward with open cases for marijuana possession and are still citing people.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains, are voting to prevent recently authorized marijuana stores from opening in their communities.
“All this is changing so fast that I don’t know what’s going to happen next,” said Daniel J. Oates, police chief at Aurora, just east of Denver.
Those in charge of regulation in Washington state are also turning the tables.
And they continue to seek advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sales licenses, all before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that, for better or worse, Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana use, first for therapeutic purposes and now for recreational use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr. Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions about what might work.
“There is no real precedent that serves as a model for us,” he says.
Washington's I-502 law goes into effect on December 6, which also leaves a year during which you will swim between two waters, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but possession will be legal.
In addition, there are some delicate mechanical issues that need to be resolved during that period, such as how to maintain a balance between the state’s requirement to provide “adequate access” to licensed marijuana and its prohibition to conduct cannabis business within a radius of less than 300 meters of schools, parks, children’s play areas or children’s centers.
“Nowhere will it be more difficult to locate a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area,” says Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently created research group.
On November 21, Oates, Aurora’s police chief, sent an email to his police officers informing them that the city’s prosecutor would stop bringing lawsuits for minor misdemeanors for possession of marijuana to people over the age of 21 and that police would stop bringing charges against those crimes “with immediate effect.”
Police chief Oates said they would be in charge of enforcing the city’s regulations governing the cultivation of marijuana for therapeutic purposes and that they would continue to pursue drug traffickers and sellers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the district attorney, Ken Buck, represents a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to pursue cases of possession of marijuana, primarily to pressure consumers who decide to receive treatment.
Currently, 119 people face charges for possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, although many of them have other charges.
“Our office has an obligation to bring legal action against those offenses that were criminal at the time they occurred,” Buck said in a statement.
The response has been complicated even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana legalization initiative.
Grand Junction Police, the largest city in the county, no longer cite adults for possession of small amounts.
County District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to dismiss any of the pending cases for possession.
"I don't think he's wasting his time by continuing to enforce the law until it changes," he said.
Although 55 percent of voters supported the measure, it was never considered that bringing recreational marijuana use into the government and the judicial system was going to be easy.
The contradictory reactions that arise throughout the state show a marked ambivalence among officials regarding the great ecological experiment in this state.
“It’s a cultural barrier with the district’s prosecutors,” said Sean McAllister, a Denver attorney who represents those accused of marijuana possession and who is a local spokesperson for the National Organization for Marijuana Law Reform.
“They’ve spent so much time taking people to court that, in fact, they can’t yet accept that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to consider small amounts of marijuana in the same way as if it were alcohol, Colorado and Washington are preparing to become national drug legalization test cases.
While lawyers and state officials have a new legal sales boundary, they also look forward to receiving directions from the federal government, which still envisions considering the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal offenses.
Advocates of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Department of Justice will give in.
Although there have been some outstanding arrests of patients and marijuana sellers for therapeutic purposes, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana sales businesses for these purposes to exist in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
“While anti-drug agents are likely not to knock down doors to confiscate a small drug bag, they will likely be reluctant to allow state-regulated stores to operate for the sale of recreational marijuana, permitted under the new law,” said Kevin A. Sabet, a former anti-drug policy adviser to the Obama administration.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana store, even though it will be about a year before any of them can open.
Last week, the western city of Montrose adopted a six-month ban and is likely to pass it next week.
“We don’t want to get into a situation where we authorize someone and then we have a serious problem at the federal level,” said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying in favor of what the community voted against voting in favor of what the state voted for."
There are many questions about this.
Petronella Wyatt: 'They harassed me until I was kicked out of Oxford for being a Tory'
You don’t attack college students for their views just now
I don’t remember a time in my life when I wasn’t dreaming of getting a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had been in what I assumed was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symposium of the contemporary era that fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thinking and tolerance.
However, within two weeks of taking my place at Worcester College in the late 1980s to pursue the career of History, I had already made the suitcases, which triggered the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and started to cry.
My friends were bewildered.
The Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left because I did not tolerate some college classmates having sex in the next room.
Writer A. N. Wilson announced jokingly that he had left me because I was being forced to drink in sloppy cups.
The truth was less fun.
I got out of there.
Yes, I did, because I had been subjected to systematic harassment and intimidation.
Not because of my flamboyant name, or the fact that I came from a private school.
I was harassed for a single reason, which in the cradle of the supposed illustration turned out to be something intolerant and barbaric: my father, the late Woodrow Wyatt, was a prominent adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservative party.
You may be wondering what that comes to now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right-wing students is suffering a similar persecution.
The institutionalized and growing hatred for the students of the conservative party is such in Oxford that, last week, a group of them claimed the same level of equality of rights as homosexuals, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the JCR (Graduate Student Group) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are “often seriously sidelined, personally attacked and treated as non-gratuitous people” for their political ideas.
They want to create a position on their college’s equal opportunity committee to make sure they can express their views freely.
His situation was not favoured by a recent BBC2 documentary called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" about student politics and presenting the Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It showed graduate student Joe Cooke, former president of the Conservative Party Association of the University of Oxford (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce, wearing a silver suit and a cane with the silver handle.
At other universities, conservative students say they are treated as “Turkish heads” by the introduction of higher enrolment rates.
Luke Black, 20-year-old and vice president of the Conservative Party Association at the University of Nottingham, said in a Sunday newspaper that “there is a growing trend of leftists in universities.
People assume we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other.”
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student at Corpus Christi who filed the motion for greater protection, says this environment is “uncomfortable,” while Stephanie Cherill, 19, who is elected president of the OUCA, says the attitude of JCR members toward people who are centre-right has worsened.
“This poses a threat to the intellectual debate environment, as well as to the well-being of members,” he says.
During my first weeks at Oxford I was more alone than one.
I entered college in September 1986, I was a terribly shy 18-year-old.
The hatred for the Conservative Party was at its highest point.
The previous year, the university had voted to deny Margaret Thatcher, a former student, an "honoris causa" title following cuts in higher education funding.
The atmosphere would have shocked any Stalinist.
Already during the first days of the welcome week to the new university students, when the new students meet and meet the professors, I received a sample of the bitterness that was waiting for me.
I found that not only did the professors turn a blind eye to the mockery of conservative university students, but they willingly participated in it.
The policy of the miners’ strike, privatization and the government’s opposition to apartheid sanctions in South Africa reached the seminary’s wooden halls.
The first I attended was to translate 18th-century French texts into English and I was not prepared for what came next.
"Miss Wyatt," said Professor Harry Pitt (already deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
Don't say a word.
Pitt, a short man with a face that looked like cake dough, knew well how to expel bad bile.
“Are the Thatcherists refusing to learn French, or are they simply fools?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
My eyes were burning with the tears I was trying to contain.
“I suggest you go to French classes in your spare time, as long as you’re not too busy meeting people,” Pitt grumbled.
I went back to my room like a grieving soul.
That night I sat alone at dinnertime in college; then I felt a slight pat on the back.
He was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said kindly.
“I’m afraid that’s how it goes.
They get involved with anyone who's suspected of being Tory.
It's very complicated for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it'll be even worse for you.
Many newly arrived Tories appear to be Labourists.”
Later, in a local pub, I tried to hide it.
I insisted that I did not agree with everything Ms. Thatcher said.
That trick was useless.
A first-year student of Philosophy, Politics and Economics who, paradoxically, had studied at Eton, said: “You are the daughter of a fascist pig.
You're contaminated."
Other students adopted this song.
I became the dirty pervert.
“How do the Tories have sex?” one asked.
"They beat each other, don't they?"
I felt the same way that homosexuals should have felt before the liberal law of the 1960s.
Could he ever lead a normal life in Oxford?
Would I be forced to stay with people who thought like me only after dark?
Would I have to become a laborer and suppress my natural tendencies?
The three years that were waiting for me presented themselves as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, Professor of Contemporary History assigned to my college.
They hated him for being not only of the Conservative party, but also an adviser to Thatcher on foreign policy and one of the people who wrote his speeches to him.
I was barely there.
He hated the place because he considered it provincial and insignificant and for its adherence to the Marxist-Determinist view of history.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
“You’re not going to be happy here,” he said.
I began to move daily from Oxford to my parents’ home in London, finding refuge in my more open metropolitan-minded family and friends.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
“But if it’s the best place in the world,” he said sadly.
“They would never do that, not there among my dear dream needles.
Even my communist friends have always had an impeccable attitude.”
His sore eyes began to cloud.
"Give him another chance.
I'm sure they did it just to joke.
My heart would break if you left it."
Tired of so many trips to London, my emotional stamina was deteriorating.
A friend of mine, who also supported the Conservative Party, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed.
The following week, during a seminar in which another professor of History had insinuated, quite seriously, that I was an “enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Red with shame inside, I admitted that my parents had “brainwashed” me and called them “stupid old men.”
The truce lasted a short time.
It was my father who put the last nail in the coffin of my university career at Oxford.
At that time, my father wrote two weekly columns in Murdoch’s press.
My door was locked.
I was inside in fear, and after five minutes, my pursuers gave up.
When they left I packed my bags and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
Maybe you'll call me a weak cry.
But no 18-year-old should be subjected to such level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 Conservative Party prime ministers but, to this day, hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentine prefers elegance to notoriety"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentine: Master of Sewing", which opened this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian designer
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer has recognized it during the inauguration of "Valentine: Master of Sewing", a retrospective apotheosis that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "maison" over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he says with his unmistakable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the culmination of a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without its distinguished clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the rare and distant world of nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there are plenty of private letters and photos with the signature of the most garnished of the aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trophies of his social rise: from the humble fashionista of the city of Voghera, in northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
Being in love with royalty has nothing wrong.
“At least they don’t turn off their fangs on your magnificent carpet like some beautiful pop music celebrities do,” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and entertains with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved being invited to their chalet in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, intimate of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to notoriety.
And yet, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, wearing a Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the fashion designer.
Many years ago, after a parade in Piazza di Spagna, in Rome, we went to his apartment for dinner.
There were 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In every detail of the floor, the decoration, the food, the music, in everything was seen and felt his spirit.
"Each of the guests made us feel important and loved," recalls the "top model", who began working with him during the Haute Couture Week in Paris in 1995.
“It never goes out of style because its designs are works of art,” he concludes.
Parade of alcurnia
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-matched loves.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries of Somerset House has been transformed into a glamorous sixty-meter long walkway that proposes a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must parade through the walkway to contemplate a dream "audience" wearing Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress that Ars Kennedy chose to wear.
In that audience of mannequins shine names such as that of Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosary of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Fashionista, 2006
Many of those customers say that the first Valentine is like the first love, “impossible to forget.”
I remember it perfectly.
It was a trousers, a shirt, a gillette vest and a jacket from the autumn-winter 1971-1972 collection.
“It was a gift he gave me,” says Naty Abascal, one of the designer’s muse.
"I prefer him above others for his femininity, for his great love for women, because it enhances our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I really like the colors it uses, they have great light and are "donors" to the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Princess and fashion prescriptor Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenbergcannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of getting to be the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening outfits...
Finally the time came at the end of the 90s.
I bought my first Valentino dress to wear at a party at my cousin’s castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red suit, with flounced skirt, draped corsage and word of honor neckline.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, his obsession is timeless,” explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her party dresses of the fashionista with "the utmost care... because a dress is not only a dress, it is also the set of memories it carries".
The “King” of Fashion
The grand end of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress at her wedding to Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (as the fashionista calls his seamstresses) to make that ivory silk suit with pearl inlays, twelve different types of lace and a four-and-a-half-meter tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the specialized press, that dress represents a milestone of high sewing of the late 20th century, "the return of the customers of high society".
Clouded for years with the elite savoir-<0xC3><0xAA>tre, now Valentino is his best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, decorated with the Legion of Honor, Garavani earns as many honors as any of her clients' husbands.
“I’ve always been drawn to its refinement, its calmness, its sleek and perfect appearance,” D’Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a great friend of mine.
"He was impeccable, time doesn't pass for him."
If a princess says so...
The Hardest Craft in the World: The Human Mules by Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano play life and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulfur through steep stone paths
There are people for whom their work is hell and another who literally works in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who make a living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to go down every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulfurous gas emanating from the Earth’s bowels solidifies as it comes into contact with the air.
After tearing off large sulfur rocks, which in total weigh about 70 kilos, he carries them in two bamboo baskets that he loads on his shoulders through steep stone paths.
They are only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to 2,386 meters of altitude, but the exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb the turtle step, keeping the balance and carefully measuring its steps so as not to slip and fall down the precipice.
They know that any skirmish could cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who was laid off years ago by the risks of Kawah Ijen.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents for every kilo of sulfur they extract
Once up, they make their way among the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus monkeys and, tiringly loading the heavy baskets, they walk three kilometers to the balance that a mining company has located a little further down, at 1,850 meters high.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has been exploiting the volcano since 1960 and, never better said, its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 cents euros) for every kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rupees (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry, as this mineral is widespread in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to whiten sugar.
"As usual it is to carry 70 kilos, we take out about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip," explains Anto, who usually performs three doors a day.
It takes three hours each and ends up ground, but they allow you to add 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems a misery to such inhuman effort, it is triple what I would win in the field.
“The miners’ newspaper is very high here, where the coffee harvest is paid at 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” explains the porter, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, his salary was 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day and the fee was not so hard, but Anto has returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, is as strong as sulfur: "I married a young woman from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java".
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases
At the age of 27, Anto has been playing hide and seek at the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already begun to bill him despite covering his face with a mask and special glasses.
He has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases that the volcano releases.
It’s the price you have to pay to get your dream.
“I will work two more years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in more than acceptable English.
Punished for life, this friendly and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, waiter or receptionist of a hotel, but instead he does the job of a mule.
Sharing a dirty wooden cabin with other porters, he gets up every day at two o’clock in the morning because sulfur does not stop manning at night, when its characteristic yellow color turns blue and shines in the midst of darkness.
Challenging the shadows, Anto descends into the crater with a small flashlight attached to his helmet, which he himself has bought with his money.
Some 400 carriers load the sulfur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater
Despite its penguin benefits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur extraction to save costs nor does it supply any equipment to porters, who work on their own and to both weight.
In fact, they don’t even see part of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) camera surcharge that, next to the 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) entrance, the guards of this natural park charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is for the beasts and not for the people,” protested Madrusin, a 42-year-old gifted porter who has been at the Kawah Ijen for three decades since he left school.
Able to lift up to 110 kilos, he says he will endure working “as much as he can” because he needs the money to educate his three children, aged 18 to 10.
I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life
Although sulfur burns the throat and stings the eyes when the wind changes suddenly and traps the miners in the thick columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complains of suffering serious diseases... beyond, of course, of their usual respiratory problems, osteoarthritis, pains in the knees and sores in the hips.
Balancing the basket on his back, Unainik can only carry 50 kilos at his 53 years old.
Every day, he and his companions pull 15 tons of sulfur out of the volcano, which three trucks transfer to the Tamansari warehouse, 18 kilometers away by a goat path between the weeds.
"I will not retire, I will die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik proclaims, opening his mouth well, where he lacks several teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, 30, also works carrying sulfur.
Time passes, but misery perpetuates from generation to generation one of the world’s toughest trades: the one made by the human mules of Kawah Ijen.
Singapore Seeks Babies to Save the Economy
Singaporeans blame career, stress and the cost of property and education for not having children.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife, we fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It may seem unlikely that these verses are part of a peppermint pill ad, but despite that — or perhaps because of that — the video went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references like “Let’s put a bao (bubble) in the oven” to laugh at Singapore’s birth rate.
The advertising company that made the video, BBH, is hoping that with the announcement they will be able to draw attention to the problem in a fun way.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do “his national duty.”
This is something purely from the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world to reproduce ourselves, so we felt this was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as throwing perfumes with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings.
Many of those ideas may have been creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we thought, why don’t we do the most creative thing we can to solve this problem, which is writing a rap?
1.2 children
The one that doesn’t take it so lightly is the government of Singapore.
It spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech state city in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its leaders and their strict social controls.
Singapore’s birth rate, according to its national population division, currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2 – known as the replacement rate – was in 1976.
So why do Singaporeans have no more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, says it’s due to a “better education” and “a wider range of career opportunities.”
“That has allowed people to have a wider range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond getting married and forming a family,” she explains.
These changes in social norms have contributed to the rise in singleness, and to delaying marriage and births, resulting in a decline in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration to cope with the declining population has created resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where barely disguised xenophobia abounds against many new immigrants, in particular the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The surge in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore’s ruling party last year experienced its worst election result since independence.
Since the elections there has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the highest quotas and levies for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has known effects on a nation’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs, and immigration policies, Singapore’s example is also having some unexpected consequences.
The government is trying not to build so many small houses.
For example, it has begun to affect the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has moved on to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoe boxes", that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have surfaces of 46 square meters and have been very successful sales.
However, there is concern that they may promote a bachelor lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large, family-friendly homes.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says its “shoe boxes” sell much faster than larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units run out days, even weeks, faster than larger units.
This makes it much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new rules give clearer guidelines for developers, who were previously hampered if they wanted to offer too many small units in a project.
Too Stressed
Singapore is a state city.
While these new rules may be a step toward increasing the national birth rate, talking to Singaporeans working in the financial district of the center doesn’t seem like they’re going to have much effect.
“People are very stressed, houses are expensive and so is education, so a lot of people are postponing it,” says a young executive.
Other people may have children.
“But for me it’s important to have my own money and time,” says another 20-year-old.
Men and women mention their careers, stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
So, no matter how much the government tries to push its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans are the ones who have the final say.
The private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy it is the quality of private or "the sphere of private life that you have the right to protect from any interference".
What is private for a child under 16?
How does this definition apply to your daily life and social media?
Do you understand the dangers you are exposed to by venturing on the Internet situations you would certainly not share offline?
The newspaper interviewed five boys between the ages of ten and 15, frequent users of the network.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with “something very mine,” on a personal level, and “in the user’s key and name,” when they applied it to social media.
“My deepest secrets wouldn’t upload them to a post,” says 10-year-old Jorge, when he tries to explain the meaning of privacy on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"They are very secretive, my mom can know them, but not everyone," she says.
On FB I upload beautiful images or games.
I also have fun with my friends.
“I wouldn’t share a photo that’s not mine, or of someone who’s making the ridiculous,” he says.
The child recognizes that it is wrong to publish obscene photographs, of naked people, of crimes or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows the 35 friends he has on FB and his nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
The mother is included, has the key to one of the accounts.
I opened Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if they'll answer me, I'll just pick them up," he adds.
“Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or my friends quickly,” she says.
He does not hesitate to answer that he would never accept a request from an unknown person.
I wouldn't even listen to someone recommending a stranger.
The case of 14-year-old Joseph is different.
The teenager has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in the latter admits not to meet 20 of the people added to his list of friends.
“It doesn’t scare me, because we have something in common, music for example,” he says.
According to the boy, no one has insinuated him or asked him for his home address or phone number.
“If they pressure me or demand it from me, I just take them out of my account,” he says.
Joseph became a follower of Ask, after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not alien to the experiences of what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend of mine was being extorted on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who he was," he said.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
"He just gave you privacy."
Then explain a series of steps to set up the account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this guy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would, if I feel bad or want to.
“I know that’s cyberbullying,” he says.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and a graduate in Education and Learning, believes that in order to guide children and adolescents it should be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“The Internet emerged as a means to search for information, but with the emergence of these sites the rules of the game changed,” he says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, a master’s degree in Pedagogy from Yale University and author of the work Natives and Digital Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who were born with technology.
“We’re the digital immigrants that we have to teach them, when we’re still learning,” he says.
He comments that the topic is complex, “because we are asking them to have a defined criterion about what is appropriate or not to disseminate, publish or say at an age that maturity does not give for that.”
“Also be selective when what matters most is being popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” he adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what privacy is to children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
“Telling them not to do it doesn’t help,” he adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or, would you like them to post a photo of you like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others are posting about you?
When you tag party photos, did you ask other people’s permission to tag them?
And one more thing, do you all need to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act online as they do offline.
They're the same rules.
"One outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, the same must be in social networks," he says.
Vigilance
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents read the policies of social networks consciously.
By understanding each of the incisions they have solid grounds for talking to their children about the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guardia, it’s key to remind children the lesson of “don’t talk to strangers.”
Unasur Summit ends without making the Lima Declaration public
The 6th Presidential Summit of the South American Union of Nations (UNASUR) concluded today in Peru without publicizing the Lima Declaration, previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven assistant presidents.
Efe tried repeatedly to access the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of Unasur, but sources from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency indicated at the beginning that they would hand it over after the closure, but later stated that it would be published on the Peruvian Government’s website at some point.
When consulted by the text, they noted that the content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during brief statements to the press.
Journalists’ access to Summit information was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the soundless video of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, restricted audio" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among the reporters was provided by the press spokespersons of some of the Unasur governments attending the meeting, although not the Peruvian one.
The only document released during the day was the list of attending presidents, which caused the unease of hundreds of journalists from various national and international media asking for more data.
Subsequently, Peru’s presidency sent an email to the media with the summit’s “final declaration,” but it was Humala’s pronouncement, not the official document that closed the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America-Arab Countries (ASPA), and on that occasion, despite being insistently demanded by the press, the so-called Lima Declaration that they had previously announced was also not disseminated.
The official website of ASPA can confirm that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities made every effort to ensure that there were secure transmission systems for all journalists, but limited the obtaining of information to the maximum.
The summit also concluded with Chile’s and Peru’s joint commitment to accept a ruling by the Court of The Hague directing a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era, met during the regional meeting and ratified that they will respect the decision of the (CIJ), which begins on Monday in The Hague to listen to the allegations of both parties, in the process that Lima presented against Santiago.
“We will comply with and execute the sentence that defines the differences that we are bringing to this international court today,” Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country respectful of international law, of the peaceful settlement of disputes, of treaties and of international courts,” Pi<0xC3><0xB1>era added, and greeted Humala with a handshake, alongside the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they will submit to the ICJ came after Colombia denounced this week the Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> Pact for which it had agreed to submit to the rulings of that international court, after a decision on maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held with the assistance of the presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from Unasur since 2011 after the dismissal of its former president Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was in charge of opening the discussions in the morning and closing the summit, shortly after noon in Lima.
The president read the final document in which he reported that 16 agreements were adopted and the lines of action for 31 projects between South American countries were set for a total of 17 billion dollars in investments.
Among the agreements adopted he mentioned that UNASUR countries will take "significant steps towards the goal of a South American citizenship for which we are expanding the agreements on residence".
He said that actions are being promoted to improve "cooperation in the fight against citizen insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make medicines more accessible, low-priced Internet access in all corners of South America, and jointly and efficiently address the risks of natural disasters."
With a Europe in crisis, “the economic consolidation (of Latin America) should not have a triumphalist matrix but should serve to expand our productive matrix and envision a better future for our peoples,” added Humala.
“We have decided to privilege a group of 31 emblematic projects that will improve the connection of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas ... uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” the Peruvian president said in a read message.
Among those projects, he mentioned that five correspond to Peru, and are located on the transverse axes of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two point to a greater connection with Ecuador, although he gave no more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations,” of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and good neighbourly relations, was another of the issues highlighted by the summit.
In this regard, the president of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before starting his participation in the regional meeting that he expected to meet with his Nicaraguan partner, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime dispute in a respectful way after a ruling by the ICJ, questioned by Bogot<0xC3><0xA1>.
"Tomorrow (Saturday) I may have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," Santos said.
"We will review all these ways, they are not exclusive, even the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," he said.
"With President Ortega I hope to be able to tell him that we handle this in the most civilized and respectful way possible," Santos said.
Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they plan to attend the takeover of the new president of that country, Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieto.
Also, as part of the summit, the bloc’s defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of UNASUR, although the last country is suspended.
Peru holds the pro-tempore presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from Europe to integrate a citizenship": Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America, in this case yes, must learn from Europe".
Correa, who participated in the 6th Presidential Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), held in Lima, told state TV Peru that the Europeans "killed themselves in World War II" and other conflicts, "but now they are practically a homeland."
He advocated, in that sense, the project of establishing South American citizenship encouraged by the member countries of Unasur.
“We have to get free mobility of citizens and workers by any South American country, as is already the case with the members of the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return us to the past,” he warned.
The Ecuadorian president also expressed support for the recomposition of the Organization of American States (OAS) under the premise of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the San José Pact on human rights.
Those who give a chair never commit to anything and, instead, we South Americans sign everything.
“It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under US funding,” he said, referring to Ecuador’s political asylum for WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he is not sorry for that decision because it has not betrayed his principles, but has respected his "deep democratic and human rights values."
He added that, at the time, "there were well-founded suspicions that Assange was being extradited to a third country and his process was not respected."
He also criticized the Swedish court for demanding that it be subjected in its territory to interrogation for an alleged sexual crime when "the Swedish legislation itself allows it to be carried out through videoconferencing, which could be done from the Ecuadorian embassy in London."
Correa said there is a risk that Assange’s physical and mental health will deteriorate.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been at our embassy, but the ambassador informed me that he had a small lung problem, nothing serious," the Ecuadorian president said.
There is a danger that your physical and mental health will deteriorate because you are locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“That complicates anyone’s health,” he added.
Correa noted that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, by granting him a lifeline that allows him to travel to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities and stressed that there have been talks with London in search of a solution to the closure of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been ongoing talks.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European legal authorities because Assange’s lawyer, Baltazar Garz<0xC3><0xB3>n, is doing a series of proceedings in different European bodies,” he said.
And he said, "If Britain gives safe passage tomorrow, this is over."
And if Sweden, as its legislation perfectly allows and as it has done in other cases, questions Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or questions him via Skype tomorrow, this problem is over.
Correa took the opportunity to reaffirm himself as a defender of freedom of the press and nuanced that what he does not tolerate is “the mediocrity, bad faith and lies, which distort freedom of expression.”
“The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the wicked and wicked politicians, but the bad journalists based on profit, blackmail and extortion,” he said.
In that regard, he welcomed the fact that these journalists are no longer "neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador", and said that if re-elected "it will deepen the revolution to continue the right path and direction".
Correa also supported the decision to keep Paraguay's veto in the Unasur at least until his next election, arguing that the body "must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and coup d'état covered with legality" because it actually "destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguayan democracy."
The Ecuadorian president also considered "perfectly pertinent" the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries after the ruling of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which benefited Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At the moment, that failure is not being met.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to walk together.
They have to be processed extensively to overcome them and move forward.
He also relied on a good conclusion of the litigation over maritime boundaries that they maintain in the same court Peru and Chile and opined that "it is right for Latin America to seek international instances if the two countries agree to accept the ruling no matter how hard it is."
Referring to the eventuality that he will stand as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in Ecuador to seek a third consecutive term, he noted that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although sometimes it is quite hard."
Correa said that if he loses the February 2013 elections, he will retire from public life.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in situations as unjust as Ecuador’s, that socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
“My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed that likely victory, because we have to accept that responsibility,” he said.
To win would be my last term in the presidency and from there we left public life.
If we lose the same.
"It's a decision," he said.
Correa also referred to the new health treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in Cuba.
I just spoke with Venezuelan Vice President Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s Maduro and he tells me that he traveled to a treatment that was already planned, routine, that was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
“It doesn’t mean a relapse in President Chavez’s health,” he said.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) which concluded with calls for greater regional integration to sustain progress, equality and security.
AIDS deaths today are a cause of late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed the result of the test: AIDS positive.
"It was as if a bomb had fallen on me," he refers to recalling the moment of the announcement, which the doctor tried to make "softer," with no apparent success.
The boy hid it from his family.
He decided to take charge of his illness alone and began to inform himself about it; with such commitment that he already celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV Unit of the Civil Hospital of Guadalajara (HCG), which he arrived in 1994 after several battles.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
Then, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was bringing a cut".
So, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and do it with quality of life.
Ignorant of their disease, however, many people still arrive when the virus has already wreaked havoc, "depleted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, at least of the first reported cases, "the great achievement at this time means that the survival of a patient who begins treatment in a timely manner and the survival of the general population, is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after reporting that this information was endorsed in April.
HIV/AIDS expert and infectologist Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fatal sentence, but the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impact on the immune system presented by patients at the start of the diagnosis, with better expectation for those who are not drug users4 years and with a report of up to 30 years.
In simple terms, the above means that those who receive the diagnosis of HIV positive at the age of 25, under these terms "as long as they remain in control will be able to live without problems until the age of 75," explained the interviewee.
To scale this advance, it should be remembered that the life expectancy of Mexicans today is on average 76 years.
While mortality has fallen significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS dropped from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNAIDS annual report), it is also true that since the onset of AIDS, 60 percent of patients in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, leaving 187 deaths as of May this year; however, universal access to antiretroviral drugs has been ensured since 2005.
- Why are there still deaths?
It seems to me that the problem is not access to treatment.
That's how I visualize it, that's how it's happened to us in our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years we have not had enough medicine the problem is that patients arrive very advanced because they do not know their infection status, that is, in late stages of the disease.
“Nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have some opportunistic infection, what needs to be done to have a greater impact on global mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, therefore, mass screenings have to be offered to all people who require it.”
In his proposal agree specialists and officials of the State Council for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco (Coesida), also the patients themselves, as Fabrizio, who went to be tested in a particular laboratory, only motivated because he had made it a friend and, despite his short age, was already in the stage of AIDS and even suffered from Kaposi's sarcoma, a common cancer that is a complication.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they’re going to die and they don’t want to know anything.
“If I’m already going to die, I’d better go three times a week,” they say not in my case.
The change was to improve, I eat well, I exercise, I take medication.
To date, his parents only know that he suffered from cancer.
I live a normal life, just like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sex life, but co-responsible, I take care of myself and the other person," said Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimacy with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate with his testimony those who today, as part of World AIDS Day, are afraid.
That they get tested, if they were at risk, that the sooner they know if they are HIV positive, it is better and if they already have the diagnosis, that they learn that they can live like anyone else, being responsible.
That, his message, sums up the battle motto to AIDS this 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are large gaps between health programs and the ordinary citizen, said Ricardo Salazar, a tapat<0xC3><0xAD>o journalist who has assumed the cause around HIV.
And the biggest one is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "effectively has increased the distribution of condoms, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of one hundred, and that is very good but it turns out that there are those today, still, do not have access to a condom," he said.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"What do you want them for?" is a common question, with sordid and value judgments from social workers, school counselors, pharmacy employees and health workers, to which adolescents do not want to be exposed, the communicator said.
He proposed reorienting this ineffective distribution; that condoms should not be just behind the counters and that those hundred should be found in public bathroom dispatchers at the sites frequented by young people.
It is not to motivate promiscuity.
Nor is it a question of paying them the chelas and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez replied, when he asked if there would be a distribution of condoms in his Administration.
"That's not sexuality, it's best to bring condoms closer to those who are already practicing sexual activity," he said.
Keys In Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state ranks 4th nationally in new and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13° of HIV.
92% of infections correspond to the sexual route, 6% to the blood route and 2% to the perinatal route.
It is estimated that 50,000 people may be living with HIV since for a registered case there are 4 to 5 people who do not know it.
Ratified by a U.S. appeals court a ruling that ignores the restructuring of the Vitro Group’s debt achieved via a mercantile tender in Mexico, the scenario sets a bad precedent for any national company with branches in the neighboring country that has solvency problems.
It would be said, therefore, that the procedures in support of the survival of the signatures that allow Mexican laws are not valid in the country of the bars and stars, contrary to international conventions.
In the practical field, the ruling issued on June 15 by Judge Harlin Hale of the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas, leaves Mexican firms defenseless in the face of the possibility of embargoing their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door for Mexico’s leading glassmaker to go to the U.S. Supreme Court, alleging three inconsistencies.
At the outset, while the judge of the case points out that creditors should be governed by the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says the main procedure is the mercantile competition processed in Mexico.
The first point would involve ignoring international procedural cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created for this purpose, with the American Law Institute as the arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the vote intercompanies, recognized in the critical mass of the commercial competition the debts that the subsidiaries of Vitro had with their parent, would not have achieved the required majority to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility is recognized by Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro’s was not the first case in which the scheme was accepted.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agrimex and Comercial Mexicana, whose intercompany debts were endorsed by the Federal Institute of Mercantile Competitions.
The truth, moreover, is that by subtracting the votes of the subsidiaries, in any case the Vitro creditors who fought against it in the U.S. Courts, i.e. the “vulture” funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, will not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37.
This is omitted by the Court of Appeal.
From another angle, he blames Vitro for the difficult situation he faced from 2008 on the eve of the serious economic crisis that the United States faced, taking the proceeds to the country.
For the time being, the Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez Sada family’s signature will file a reconsideration appeal with the appeals court itself so that the vote reaches the full court, i.e. the five judges, since only three voted.
If the latter does not prosper, Cerciorare’s appeal will be claimed, which requires the review of the process by a higher court, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
The serious aspect of the case is that the court omitted a document sent by the Mexican government under the figure of amicus curiae ("friend of the Court"), which details the procedure followed by Vitro under the Mercantile Contests Act, noting that it was disbanded in accordance with the agreements signed by both countries to tie it to the Bancar Chapter 15.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Carambola of two bands: they beat Vitro and beat the country.
General Balance
After sleeping for several months the complaints placed on the table by the unions of Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n against the ex-owner of the company, Gast<0xC3><0xB3>n Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Trade Union Association of Aviators Pilots has already found the bottleneck.
The court headed by Carlos D<0xC3><0xAD>az Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez Morineau has just filed a criminal lawsuit against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstruction of justice.
Accordingly, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to report to the Attorney General’s Office of the Republic on an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to extract from the trust F/589 of Banco IXE, on behalf of Mexicana de Aviaci<0xC3><0xB3>n, 198 million pesos.
The resources would have been channeled to the purchase of shares of the Professional Hotel Manager.
As you know, Azc<0xC3><0xA1>rraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Searching for the Dragon Mars
Gathered over the weekend at a forum at the University of the Caribbean, a group of domestic and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and civil society members in general approved the creation of a broad front to oppose the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
We are talking, as you know, about a colossal sales and distribution center facing Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of products of the country of the wall, with a zone of housing for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, Canacintra had managed to unify the governors of the southeastern area to oppose the monumental thing that razed some protected areas and raised the mother of all hiding places against the industry.
The ACTA died.
Overlaid by the government a Senate demand to explain under what terms and circumstances the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known in English as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Industrial Property the matter has already passed to the file.
As you know, the action took place despite the fact that the Senate itself had disqualified the possibility by considering it an attack on freedom of expression on social networks.
Long-term homex
In an effort to pay off long-term debts without affecting short-term ones, housing developer Homex is placing 500 million pesos worth of stock certificates on the market.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Balance has been my life"
Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years linked to the sport of planking and, thanks to him, traveled the whole world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a mental collection of the history of local basketball as wide as Hector "Hetin" Reyes has.
And is that before a stroke confined him to a wheelchair in 2008, Reyes was immersed in the sport for more than 60 years, whether as a minor-league player, a national senior basketball player, a proxy and leader in the BSN with the Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n Cowboys or president of the Basketball Federation.
“I put a lot of hats on basketball throughout my life, including several at the same time, like when I was president of BSN, general manager of the National Team and federal president during the 90s,” Reyes recalled during a First Hour visit to his home in Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n, where he resides with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball has been my life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate in making that assertion.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memorabilia that denote his wide trajectory, testify to this.
Bayam<0xC3><0xB3>n in the heart
Of all the players, the most exciting are those who remember his passing through the Cowboys from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he turned 15 years old acting as co-owner or owner of the franchise.
“Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most because I had the opportunity to be part of eight Cowboys championships since 1967, whether as a pro, co-executive or leader.
There were many years of satisfactions, including the five championships run from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year at BSN.
From there "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great administrator, took over," Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who had directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me, "I have a very strong player, 6'7" tall.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico has had.
Bartow then recommended sniper Raymond Gausse, who was nativized and was one of our best shooters.
I remember he said that if Mincy had given Bayamon one championship, Gausse would help bring another.
The Cowboys championship with Gausse enjoyed it, but already at a distance, because by 1988 it was already a more federative command.
For that time he preferred to enjoy his executions and those of Mincy in the National Team.
I remember when we first beat the United States during the 1989 Pre-Olympic Games in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we came fourth and it must have been bronze if it wasn’t for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final play for the second time, Reyes said.
Is that group of the 1990 World Cup the best National Team you've ever seen?
He is among the best, just like the one who won the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favorite was the Pan American in Cuba in 1991, when we won gold and gave a fur to the U.S. team, which was quite similar to the one we won bronze in the world.
That team not only repeated Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico L<0xC3><0xB3>pez and "Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "To<0xC3><0xB1>ito" Colon and James Carter young, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to be in the 90s due to a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personnel, but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was that of the 1995 Pre-Olympic in Neuquén, Argentina.
With role players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and a young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing players suspended by the mess of the Pan American Silver Sea, we won gold against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
No doubt, that was Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n Ortiz.
Their numbers at international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has mastered at that level like Picul<0xC3><0xAD>n did.
And that’s not counting his career in the different leagues he played.
Who was the best Puerto Rican leader?
That's very difficult.
We have had a very good layer that includes Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I really like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you consider your greatest achievement in the federation?
To have been part of the most glorious era of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that in the early 90s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What's left for you to do?
There were things I would have wanted to implement, such as the regionalization of the smaller categories.
For example, the Ponce boys would only play in their area and only face teams from other corners of the Island in the national playoffs.
Right now children travel and play too much unnecessarily.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and coursework for leaders, table officers and referees.
That pleases me.
What are you doing now?
The most I do is listen to music, watch videos of the music of my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and occasionally go to basketball games.
And of course, enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Actor Larry Hagman has died.
Larry Hagman, born September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, became world famous for his central role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R.", in the television series "Dallas", in which he played an unscrupulous, malicious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil tycoon predator J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 1980s, has died.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon from cancer complications, according to a family statement provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., the producer of "Dallas."
“Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the iconic role he loved most,” the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original series and sequel, was with Hagman when she died in a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
It brought joy to everyone I knew.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992 and admitted to drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, he was found a malignant tumor in the liver and underwent a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became famous on television as a decent guy in the light comedy "I Dream of Jeannie", broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In it he played Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life is altered when he finds an attractive genius, played by Barbara Eden, and takes her to live with him at his house.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included well-received critical roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly detestable J.R. that led Hagman to his highest stardom.
The CBS drama series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its orbit aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", designed to generate expectation around an emotional episode in which Hagman's character is almost killed, generated international speculation and millions of dollars in risky bookmakers.
It also helped give the series an audience record at the time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, an average of 41 million viewers tuned in and made "Dallas" the second most-watched entertainment program in history, behind the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was J.R.'s sister-in-law Kristin (played by Mary Crosby) who shot him.
J.R. got her pregnant and then threatened to stab her as a prostitute unless she left town, but others also had reason to attack him.
Hagman portrayed Ewing as an insatiable corrupt with a charismatic smile: a cheating businessman and an unfaithful husband who attempted to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), hospitalized.
“I know what I want in J.R.’s tombstone,” Hagman said in 1988.
He should say, "Here lies the honest citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only deal he lost.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as someone "huge, on and off the screen".
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of admirers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we were fortunate to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
He had already finished recording five of the chapters for the second season and a sixth was in the process, the network reported.
There was no immediate pronouncement from Warner or TNT on how the series would handle Hagman’s loss.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who starred in classics such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when he had it in 1931 during his marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York stage in the early 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
While there, she met young Swedish designer Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin': Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn’t put anything there that I thought was going to hurt someone or affect them in any way,” he told Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he became a promoter of organ donation and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist fearful patients.
“I advise them, I give them courage, I meet with them when they come for their surgeries, and then,” he said in 1996.
I try to offer some comfort, like "don't be afraid, it will be a little uncomfortable for a short time, but you'll be fine."
He was also an anti-smoking activist and participated in several campaigns.
Start a course that explores the "End of the World"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to teach a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible hook: The end of the Mayan Calendar’s “long countdown” on December 21, which many people have held as proof that the end of the world is coming.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next couple of months: the cataclysmic Hurricane Sandy, a fiscal precipice that some have called "debt-armageddon" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where end-time Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn’t realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester there has ever been,” Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If you look at what has been happening in the world today as if we were 30 days away and counting, this has been a really good period.
And remember that evil is good for those of an apocalyptic mindset.
And he’s not the only teacher offering courses on the “end of the world” this semester, in theory the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching the course “Media, Culture and the End of the World.”
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
“We analyze why these ideas proliferate over time,” he said, and how they offer hypothetical scenarios that guide certain human behavior.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month students analyzed films with apocalyptic themes and explored how they compare to real-life examples.
“I’ve tried to inform students about what’s possible, likely, credible, and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of Art History and Anthropology, have teamed up to teach a course, titled “The End of the World.”
“We don’t add ‘2012’ to always have the option to teach the course again, in case the world doesn’t end,” Restall said.
Despite the “imminent ruin,” students must study, generate projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam will be taken on the eve of the Apocalypse, leaving students no choice but to work “until the very night the world is supposed to end,” Restall said.
The courses were quite popular.
“It was saturated in two hours,” Restall said of his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
We received emails for weeks and weeks before the start of the semester from people asking if there was still room.
Students, for their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“I find it fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves,” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, in Rutgers-Camden.
The apocalyptic mentality, secular or religious, is only a matter of comfort or the absence of it.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old psychology and nursing career student, said he had seen all the apocalyptic movies.
“I had never heard of a class that could teach that,” he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But no student interviewed — let alone a professor — said they believe the December 21 deadline.
“Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy and in a way we discredited it,” said Julie Zeglen, a senior student at Temple, 21, and West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it’s just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
But he noted that there is an apocalyptic anxiety in Western culture, which goes back several centuries, where people react to changes around them predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an upsurge in these speculations.
“On other sides people don’t think about this,” he said.
Mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at La Salle University who teaches courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about any course on the “end of the world” there.
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he wrote, insinuating an exception from a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall noted that over the years there has been talk of many days of the final judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will start thinking immediately about the next date" or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date lightly.
Several said they plan to go to "end-of-the-world" parties.
“Maybe call some friends so we can laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
