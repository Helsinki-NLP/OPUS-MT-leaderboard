A thousand farmers reached the High Court against the Dream Project bullet train for the development of Gujarat

At the international level, China is trying to create an international currency at the same level as the Euro, Yen and Pound, including the U.S. dollar.
India and Russia are looking at the possibility of making this deal in rupees and rubles, considering the possibility of an economic embargo from the US.
International Desk: India and Russia have reached an agreement on the S-400 defense missile system between the US sanctions chemists today.
Russian President Vladimir Putin will be seen signing the agreement with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the second day of his two-day visit to India.
The S-400 deal is on the way to the U.S. dollar and the U.S. government is trying to get a deal between the two countries.
Sources claim that India and Russia are looking for ways to make the deal in rupees and rubles, given the possibility of an economic embargo from the US.
The U.S. imposed a ban on China during the deal.
It is worth mentioning that in September, Russia signed an S-400 missile deal with China.
After the deal, U.S. President Donald Trump decided to impose a ban on China.
Due to this ban, the purchase of missiles using the U.S. dollar for China became almost impossible.
However, over the past few years, China has tried to raise its currency, the yuan, against the dollar as an international currency.
After this initiative, China is constantly trying at the international level to make the yuan an international currency equivalent to the euro, yen and pound, including the dollar.
On the other hand, China has the largest reserve surplus of the U.S. dollar in international trade.
China wants the U.N. to become an international currency.
The five-billion-dollar mega defense deal could see the U.S. impose a U.S. anti-catasic (CAATSA) ban on countering U.S. Adversary Throat Sections (CAATSA).
Last month, the U.S. imposed a ban on the purchase of the S-400 missile system on China.
India and Russia had already started to set up an alternative arrangement for the deal.
Earlier, a US ban on the INS Chakra repair deal, which was leased from Russia, resulted in a seizure of an estimated $2 billion deal between India and Russia.
The economic analyst claims that in order to get out of such a situation, India should exercise a deal using the rupee-rouble exchange as an international currency.
It is worth noting that so far, all the defense deals made by India with Russia have been made only through the dollar.
Why did the U.S. Constitution become law?
President Donald Trump approved the Katsa law in August, keeping in mind Russia's modern defense missile system. - The United States has drafted this law to prevent Russia from working against the interests of the United States at the international level.
It should be noted that this law of the United States of America has been prepared in the light of the activities of Russia.
This includes Russia's assault on Ukraine in 2014, its seizure of Crimea, its involvement in the Syrian civil war, and its interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
Then, suddenly, a thousand-year-old secret emerged.
Remarkable Desk: This story is about a Turkish man who made a great discovery of how to repair a house.
When the wall of his basement collapsed while being repaired, he collided with a secret door.

There are 600 doors to enter and exit the city.
There are a lot of doors that are there to keep people from entering the city.
Each floor can be closed in a different way.
It is believed that the city was built between 780 and 1180 BC in order to protect the people here in the wars and natural disasters between Arabs and the Second World War.
The following is a list of tourist attractions:
Darinkuyu is not the only underground city in the world.

Whether or not the mosque is an integral part of Namaz Islam, the Supreme Court's decision today
The High Court on Thursday is likely to hear its decision on the applications of the Muslim group seeking reconsideration by a large back on the 1994 Supreme Court decision on the rights dispute over the Ram Janm Bhumi-Babri Masjid property.
It should be noted that in the decision, the High Court had said that the mosque is not an integral part of Namaz Islam.
According to the news agency, Chief Justice Deepak Misra and Justice Ashok Bhushan and Justice S Abdul Nazeer will make their decision at the back of the bench.
He was released from the hospital on July 20.
The Ayodhya case raised an objection to this particular conclusion in the 1994 decision in the case of M. Siddiqui, a fundamentalist.
It has been said that the mosque is not an integral part of the prayer offered by the followers of Islam.
Siddiqui has died and is being represented by his legal heir, he said.
The Muslim communities have argued before a bench chaired by the Prime Minister Judge that the decision needs to be reconsidered by the five-member bench on the observation of the High Court.
Because its Babri Masjid - Ram temple, will have an impact on the land dispute.
Senior Adjutant Rajiv Dhawan, speaking on behalf of Siddiqui's legal representative, said that the mosque is not an integral part of Islam.
This comment was made by the High Court without any self-examination or consideration of religious books.
The Uttar Pradesh government had told the apex court that some Muslim communities had sought reconsideration of the comment on the long-standing Ayodhya-Masjid land dispute over the non-existence of an integral part of the mosque.
Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, speaking on behalf of the UP government, said the dispute had been waiting for a final decision for almost a century.

"Remember my word, this kid is going to play for India.
He tells the story of the world's greatest slumber.
"The Lord said to the wise man, 'What I have seen, the earth is learning quickly.'
It's a different thing to have a talent in a player, but if you wash that talent, it's more important.
If you want to be successful in international cricket, you need to have the ability to learn quickly.
It is necessary to have adaptability (the ability to play according to circumstances) to play for a long time in different terrains and condiments.
I think that the Earth has the ability to play by the rules of the game in different situations in the show and this is the greatest strength of the Earth.

How can the official language of Sultan Mahmud Ghazni, the Sultan of Ghazni, be Sanskrit for the devotee of the Somnath temple and for the common Indian?
In fact, it has become clear from the research of Professor Shanta Pandey, the historian of Delhi University, that Ghazni's official language was Sanskrit.
Now when Shri Somnath Trust was honoured for the service of the Sanskrit of Dr. Gautam Patel and Dr. Mannibhai Prajapati, Sanskrit was merely a folk language that was the language of the alleged high-ranking Brahmins only, that was the language of the interrogators.
The Pandit Ghulam Dastigar Birajdar of Mumbai was commemorated.
The 87-year-old Pandit Birajadar, who speaks in a simple Sanskrit language that can also be understood by the rickshaws, is still finalizing the Sanskrit translation of the Holy Qur'an before publication today.
The Holy Qur'an is a Sanskrit word in his view.
Ku+Ran means the sound or teaching heard on the earth by the messenger.
Not only did he study at the Solapur school, but today he is considered to be one of the great Sanskrit scholars of the country.
However, Saav Siddiqui does not seek to give the definition of Sanskrit pandit in the United States or other countries in order to market himself.
The princess of Thailand is a pandite of Sanskrit.
There is a culture of self-sacrifice there.
In order to learn Sanskrit from the United States, students have to go to the Bonn University in Germany.

Pandit Nehru has said that a huge chapter in "The Philosophy of My Hindu" "The Power and Sustained Power of the Sanskrit Language" in Afghanistan and the Pashto language of the Pashtuns came from Sanskrit.

Dr. Ambedkar's party of national language seems to be another surprise that the main body of the Constitution, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar, and some other Muslims as well as members of the South Indian Constituent Assembly, made the Constitution of the country.
Vice Foreign Minister Dr.B.V.A.Kesak and Vice Foreign Minister Dr.B.V.A.Kesak were among those who proposed the national language to Sanskrit when the discussion on the national language was held in the Constituent Assembly on September 13, 1949 against Hindi.
The discussion of that day and the previous one are estimated to be the instigation of the Sanskrit language in view of the report published in the "National Herald" of September 11, 1949.
Unfortunately, even today, we have not been able to determine any national language.
Twenty-two Indian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, Urdu, have a place in our Constitution as Rajbhasha (Official Language), but the national language (National Language) is not the only one.
According to the census of the year 2011, Sanskrit is now the mother tongue of only 24,821 people in the country, and we have put it in the position of only a handful of Shobhas.
The Honble Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, also spoke with great respect about Sanskrit at the Constituent Assembly.
In the relevant chapter of his book, he has turned his attention to Sanskrit and has detailed the importance that scholars of the world have given to Sanskrit: "In the year 1874, Sir William Jones said, "The Sanskrit language is very ancient.
It is fuller than the Greek language, more abundant than the Latin, and more noble than both.
Nehru further notes: "I don't know how many times the Sanskrit has become a dead language, i.e. since it became extinct as a vernacular."
At the moment, it is only a matter of taking oath as a member of the Sanskrit language prayer or Union Minister Smriti Irani as a Member of Parliament.
We need to make it alive and popular by conquering the year of Sanskrit.
If the dead language of Israel can be revived to Hebrew, then Sanskrit is still a living language.
It would be a good idea to try it out instead of trying to make it into a popular language.
