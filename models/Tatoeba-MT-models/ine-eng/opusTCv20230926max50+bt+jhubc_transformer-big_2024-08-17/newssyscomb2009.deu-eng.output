The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, totaling 29 percent
A noticeable weakening of both parties of the previous grand coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties brought after the first preliminary results the preliminary parliamentary elections of Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP) suffered particularly severe losses, where the position of the former chairman Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the tip.
In contrast, the election leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the Carinthian state leader J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, is preparing for a triumphant return to federal politics.
According to the results so far, the Social Democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8 percent of the vote remains the strongest force in the country, but compared to the last elections in 2006, it loses 5.5 percent of the vote.
Even worse was the <0xC3><0x96>VP, which lost almost nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in Austria’s post-war history, and especially for the People’s Party, which had demanded the early elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the People’s Party had a clear lead over the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
But voters have probably punished the party for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results there was speculation about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former vice-chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could be the case as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party board.
Such a development would probably pave the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the grand coalition of the SP<0xC3><0x96> and the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
In view of the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Libertarians (FP<0xC3><0x96>) had received a provisional government of 18 percent in 2005, the BZ<0xC3><0x96> received eleven percent of the votes - but at the same time the Social Democrats gave expression to their fear that 1999 could be repeated as the People's Party had agreed with the Populists Union (then the BZ was still in power).
J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider obviously relies on this development, who has already declared that he is ready to cooperate with any party and expects a return to Vienna to Austrian federal politics.
In addition, the Green party also entered the parliament, but suffered slight losses and dropped from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has probably mastered the four-percent barrier and therefore did not enter parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may cool off
If it fails to solve the problem with Czech scientists accused in India of illegally collecting bugs, in the opinion of Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg, there could be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister stressed this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then sure, then there will be a certain cooling," he said after a meeting that took place on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks that the executive could only intervene in judicial matters with difficulty.
Despite everything, he argued that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>cha, who was acquitted of the charge and received a fine, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling wanted to, in whose case the matter falls.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherdshi said it would be best for him to appeal to a higher court.
He could thus request release on bail and wait in freedom for his verdict, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had spoken in the same way during negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a pardon would be in question for him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can intervene in the whole matter is to provide the convicted person with “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance would already be offered to them by the Indian side.
“We have a great interest in maintaining good contacts with India, which has a long-term tradition.
The Indians also admit it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, according to the Czech Press Agency <0xC4><0x8C>TK, in front of its partner, the Czech Republic attached great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really think it's a big mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question of whether he had received a commitment from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister departed.
“I’ve already been promised a lot,” he said.
A Czech judge on the struggle for the seabed
It is based on an electronic map showing Australia and the adjacent sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it also the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-member team of the UN Division for Oceans and Maritime Law.
Its head, the division director, the Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and complements it on and off.
Here there is a lot of work and enthusiasm.
The seabed contains a little-known world that is rich in natural sources.
Here you can find petroleum, ore and other non-renewable raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which, for example, hold the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A seabed larger than the mainland
Today, the acceding countries vehemently declared their claim to the new maritime areas.
After a UN convention, they make use of their rights, which they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches into the sea up to a few hundred kilometers far from the shore of a country.
According to the Convention, this country has an exclusive claim to all sources of the continental shelf.
"Simply put, as a continental shelf, the part of the seabed and its soles is considered to represent a natural continuation of the continent below the sea surface.
It crosses the borders of the waterfront, often also the border of two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The request submitted by the relevant country to the Commission to establish the external borders of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many cost-intensive studies and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical support to the Commission.
The Commission has so far negotiated five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the last three countries have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
An international echo was recently encountered by the success of Australia, which was the first country to be able to significantly increase its sea areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extent of the seabed, which was approved by the Commission last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The profits that will accrue to them in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be of inestimable value.
Other states will also gradually submit their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment you ratify the Montego Bay Agreement.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is referred to by the convention as “the common heritage of humanity”.
No state has a special role here.
The right to promote in this field is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seabed is not a gold-digging land," says director Mikulka with a little exaggeration, adding that "its individual areas are legally defined and the system is contractually anchored".
The Czech Republic in the Pacific
Today, part of the sea floor also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, due to the Convention, it was granted the status of a so-called "breakthrough investor" as well as the investors of a few other states.
The organization has the right to promote in the zone ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be investigated by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The seabed is divided there, it is a kind of tatra on the seabed.
"You can promote there on an area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetal concretions containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the division Rober Sandev brings such a concretion as a pattern.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, with some imagination, of the fabulous scheme that brought the legend to life after the Golem.
German special forces were on site during the hostage release
The Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany to solve the hostage crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they were not used.
The circumstances of the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are becoming more and more known.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior, German special forces were indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
Accordingly, both specialists of the Bundeswehr as well as officials of the GSG 9, the air force staff of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts of the Technical Assistance Office were at the site of the liberation.
However, German forces were not needed because the hostage-takers had let their prisoners run and fled when they recognized signs of a violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to include them as support forces on the ground.
"Fortunately, it did not come to this," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped the group of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and their eight Egyptian companions on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the abduction in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages had been dragged back and forth in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
Until recently, the identity of the hostage-takers remained unclear, as did the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
The rescuers have now arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the freed hostages were in the custody of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
At first, there was no information in Berlin about when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five holidaymakers and the special forces are to be flown out with an Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has narrowly failed the $700 billion bailout package for the financial markets.
The Dow Jones went deep.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives has rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets.
Despite all the appeals of US President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority for the program to contain the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $ 700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, had called on MPs to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he admitted.
In the course of the vote, the Dow Jones fell by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason was investor concerns that the state bailout package might fail.
He recovered shortly before the end of the vote, and then, after becoming aware of the failure, collapsed again.
Experts now expect further severe turbulence in the international financial markets.
The approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate is required for the program to enter into force.
Organizers record increasing number of bookings
It seems to be a good winter for the German tour operators:
For travel bookings for the coming months, sales have increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic prospects, according to one study, the desire of Germans to travel remains undisturbed.
When booking for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a revenue increase of 31 percent compared to the previous year, as reported by the German Travel Association (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to the market research institute GfK, the number of bookings has also increased for the autumn months.
Thus, the turnover of the travel agencies for October amounted to around eleven percent compared to 2007, the DRV said.
These results are based on GfK figures, which evaluate monthly booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and calculate high for the overall market.
The travel bookings made until the end of August 2008 are recorded.
Due to the weak dollar exchange rate, travel to the United States is particularly in demand, the DRV said.
Here, the booking increase amounts to about a third.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the local counties, are particularly popular destinations among Germans.
In particular, package travel was high on the agenda, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increasing costs for energy and food, the costs are "more calculable for the customer than with individually organized holidays".
Consumers could save money, among other things, through early booking discounts or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
The summer months were also very well booked, so that there will be a turnover increase again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans taking a trip decreased compared to the previous year.
My first time Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres-Ski hits in the endless loop, beer from liter jars and celebrities in Designer-Dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is blonde, TV presenter and wears a tailor-made dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second hand.
But one thing unites us: barely three minutes on the meadow, already the photographers fall on us and snap the memory cards full - very flattering and that on my first visit to the meadow.
That's how you make friends.
The cheap-Dirndl seems to fulfill its purpose.
As Wiesn-Touri and actually located north of the Wei<0xC3><0x9F>wurst Equator, the feeling of well-being in the attire has remained limited until now.
But once you arrive at the Theresienwiese, everything is half as bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or touches embarrassingly - everything is completely normal.
Strange glances at the chocolate banana stand only harvest my dirndlsch<0xC3><0xBC>rze.
A Munich woman warns me that I would have tied the apron incorrectly: "Left hoast free, middle virgin, right pardoned, widowed at the back."
Secretly, I froze the loop from the back to the left.
"Fine," he said, laughing.
Others spend less effort on subtle flirting techniques and wear simple felt hats that say "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch the naked back against an uninvited.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is called Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it "gorgeous", with a long "oooooo".
This is what he tells me after he gets rid of his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, everyone thinks he's a garbage can.
So Bob is one of those infamous "Wildbieslers."
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
At about eight o’clock in the evening, paramedics run in droves across the main square, who have to take care of the poor swallows.
The nurses always appear in the pack - always four at a time drag a covered carry from tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: Empty, full back.
You can't see who's under the plane in the Promille sarg.
"These are the ones who are packing up," one of the paramedics called me on request and disappeared into the mist.
Name of accident victim announced by police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in hospital after being hit by a vehicle in Essex has been announced.
Carole Paulson, who lives on Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the Friday afternoon accident on Shenfield Road in the city centre.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident on suspicion of reckless driving.
He has since been released on bail.
Turkey expands diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, European powers were interested in penetrating deep into Turkey’s hinterland.
On the eastern side of the Bosporus, perhaps only 20 steps inside Asia, stands one of the finest relics of this failed imperial endeavor.
The Hydarpasha station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the guides tell you.
The building sits equestrianly at the end of the platforms with a tower at each corner of the front and thus looks like some provincial German town hall.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is falling apart.
But once you are inside the vaulted ticket counter, there is no doubt about the grandeur of the project, whose westernmost approach this was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolian-Baghdad Society.
Germany, which was a pawn in the imperialist game, had before its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, by means of a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is now Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperialist plans were paralyzed during the First World War.
His railroad tracks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his Arabs.
The relative isolation from its surrounding region, created by the insurmountable limits of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces moved out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria
And there was also bad news for Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, an ammunition train flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disintegrated, largely transitioned from history.
Today, however, this railway line serves, at least symbolically, as a gateway to Anatolia and everything to the east of it, in order to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Tukei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from neighboring regions, generated by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
There is now a policy of rapprochement.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to be able to assess the key data of this new foreign policy, I boarded the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a bumpy ride on tracks that produced the old-world equivocation in the well-known documentary "The Night Mail", I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is considered a new city, for the new secular state project, to turn its back on the Ottoman past.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in Turkish unity.
This has triggered a lot of mistrust in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi took me to the AKP’s main office, a custom-built, state-of-the-art stone and steel structure, in a developing suburb, surrounded by half-finished shopping malls and pubs where middle managers met in suits, both men and women, to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a centre-right politician from almost every other political party in Europe.
Suit, tie, I'm sure he even packed a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbours.
The Cold War was an exception,” he tells me.
Turkey had been cut off from its hinterland.
Today, it has to look east and west at the same time.
There would be no one or the other.
She would have to do both.
“But surely Turkey could at some point,” I asked, “be forced to decide?”
"Turkey," he said, "did not want to have to make this decision."
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone I spoke to here almost routinely made: Turkey's relations, not only with the Middle East but also with the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are just as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be that, in the transferred sense, Europe as a whole can travel east towards Asia and the Middle East on flat railway tracks.
Back at Hydarpasha station, after another largely sleepless night, I thought of these two German lordships Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had watched the construction of this building 100 years ago.
How surprised they would have been to learn that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now, to a large extent, be in Turkey’s hands.
And as I waited at the dock for the ferry to take me back across the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At the time, at least, there seemed to be little doubt as to which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Death" Handley (nicknamed September 11) was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Choir.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth choir, Proteus, the following year.
It was intended for young people up to 21 years old, but when the choir sang in 1979 for the last time, some of us were already in our late 20s - we simply refused to leave the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape-shifter) stood for the readiness and ability of the choir to take on any piece of music presented to it, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical versatility of such a young choir was often amazing, always exciting and existed only thanks to the inspiration of that man and his enthusiasm for the music, which never read after for years.
How often did death stop us from “letting the music speak for itself”?
He used to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in the music.
So sing it!"
His way of conducting was absolutely clear and precise, never masterful but also never superfluous.
No matter how high the musical level, he always demanded an even higher one.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any conductor should have been beaten to the knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, when he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years or so, I have written reviews for over a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I was never disappointed by a single one – often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of greatness and personal modesty.
He detested conductors who, in his words, simply "went home with one or two known sheepherders in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your obituary for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "he resumed teaching economic history at Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon-Norman research scholarship in 1950 ... while at the same time studying for a BSc, an MA and a PhD.
This is a conclusion from an author's comment in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British rubber industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British Rubber Industry".
He was in the United States from 1950 to 1951 on a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to cover up this part of his career.

Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda begins marketing the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While its predecessor model had a large interior, this large limousine offers a much larger one.
In addition, there are also the technical details that allow even more comfortable driving and fuel savings.
Changes before the coming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, aesthetically speaking, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes made to this large limousine are numerous.
Among other things, the innovative design, the new room flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics should be emphasized.
However, before you begin to analyze the new model, it must be said that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter period of time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon in terms of its sales in other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the best-selling car of 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After jazz appeared on the market, about a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 models of Jazz in 2007, the expected estimates amount to 10,000 cars, which is 17% of the expected growth in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the managers of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More specifically, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model allows to cover up the sales decline in Spain.
In reality, the brand’s leaders hope to close the year with total sales of 22 000 models, which is 4 000 fewer cars than in 2007, a reduction of 16%.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8% compared to the previous year (1.6%).
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach 2% in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda relies on the appearance of a new model.
This is Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters in length, the Japanese company hopes to sell about 200,000 models a year around the world.
According to the Japanese manufacturer’s market estimates, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed in the Old Continent and Japan.
The Insight is scheduled to launch in the first months of the year, with its first public presentation taking place in Valencia in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz is growing in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, this leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters larger.
The height, on the other hand, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel tank, a solution that was also used in Jazz’s predecessor model.
The capacity of the trunk, which has a system of double loading area, also reaches up to 339 liters, i.e. 19 liters larger than the capacity of the first generation trunk.
It must be emphasized that these measures are present in the version with a 1.4-liter gasoline engine, because the capacity of the trunk of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2-liter gasoline engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, in addition to the additional equipment such as leather seats or the possibility of installing panoramic windows, an improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz having only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 versions of the gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and lower CO2 emissions, has excellent technical performance and at the same time provides high torque performance for the entire engine life.
The first variant with 1.2 liters achieves the power of 90 hp at 6,000 revolutions with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 min?1.
This gasoline engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of gasoline consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the predecessor engine, which reached 83 hp in the previous generation, it now manages to get to 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS 1.4 model has 5.4 liters of fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
<0xE2><0x80><0x9E>Auto-Bee“, which avoids collisions
In order to advance the development of accident prevention technologies, this time Nissan was inspired by nature, more precisely, by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight is based on the swarming behavior of bees and avoids accidents.
This robot is a Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C and represents the first step in accident prevention technologies.
Engineers from the Nissan Motor Co. Technical Development Center have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, head of technology PR and R&D brand management, the BR23C is an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety badge.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid collisions.
During the flight, each bee builds its own oval-shaped cockpit, which is very similar to the Nissan safety sign.
But the most important are the bee’s facet eyes, which can see from an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, allowing her to fly undisturbed in her personal airspace without interruption.
To replicate the all-round perspective, the engineers developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
It detects obstacles up to two metres away from the BR23C and within a 180-degree radius, calculates the distance to the object, and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor, which is directly translated into signal to avoid collision.
“The moment an obstacle is noticed, the little robot will mimic the bee flight and immediately change direction by turning its wheels at 90o or even greater angles to avoid collision.
The biggest difference from other arbitrary systems is that this avoidance maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If not, the robot might not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the project’s lead engineer.
Unlike a bee, the robot can’t deviate upwards or downwards, but it can’t move in two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to rotate its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in infinite ways that the bees do.
For this reason, in addition to acceleration and deceleration functions, Nissan has used the rotation function to prevent the small robot from colliding.
<0x60>This device only takes a few seconds to process the information and act on it.
It does not require either the information or the intuitive logic of the performed maneuvers to store, so it can continuously work with only a few dozen KB of storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it is not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of storage space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collisions, a technology that Nissan is predicted to introduce in the next ten years in the production cars.
The robot works with lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite, in order to guide when driving to the destination while avoiding obstacles on the way.
She's in a quagmire before she's charged with a mortgage.
One has to realize that the U.S. Treasury, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis, and in order to prevent US citizens from being involved in mortgage histories of the supposedly payable banks, an entertaining and informative game was developed for internet surfers: <0x60>Bad Credit Hotel', it says.
Or maybe, the <0x60>hotel of bad loans' or the mess.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times about whether it is time to ask for no credit.
And especially where you can do it, which is also probably the goal of the game.
It certainly has useful information, but without details.
This is more of a site for teenagers than a place for all viewers.
What will happen if the game is expanded?
Well, when a dreamy room in the hotel appears.
At least something, because it’s not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley makes its capital available to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its business, making it the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and take over 21% of its capital, an innovation that is due to a strong fall in its stock exchange rate.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley common stock at a unit price of $25.25, bringing the total amount to $3 billion.
The assumed price is below 19% of the price of the stock as of August 31.
MUFG will invest an additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will secure a profit of 10% and can be resold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global business will be conducted on the basis of a uniform average price of $29, i.e. 28% above the current exchange rate value.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock fell 6.79% to $23.07 at 17.00 GMT.
“This strategic connection represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to holding bank status,” said John Mack, CEO of the American Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, allowing it to expand its operations to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their association with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing Wall Street’s biggest names to take a much more cautious stance than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the deal has changed over the past few days: Last Monday Morgan had simply stated that she would sell up to 20% of her shares for about $8.5 billion to Japan.
“A week ago,” Toshihide Mizuno, Managing Director of the MUFG, said in Tokyo, “we thought that the stake would consist entirely of common shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and secure ourselves.’
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go with a reduction of profit by about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred shares into common shares in one year if the latter are exchanged for more than 50% of the sales value within a given period, i.e. approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds provided by MUFG will enable it to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen its balance sheet and increase its sales.
However, a spokesman for the group refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic plans of the two new allies.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to record a solvency ratio of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan said it had "significantly" lowered its balance sheet since the end of August.
The past few weeks have been tough for the group, which had to watch their stock market price halve as the price of non-payment insurance skyrocketed.
This price fell on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of the big investment banks on Wall Street following the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that it had raised $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa this Monday in Quito.
Re-establishing the republic around 21st century socialism.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
It was the third one who, following the example of his fellow-men and friends, put the plan of a new constitution to the vote this Sunday.
Mission accomplished, because according to the public results of 80% of the vote, 64% voted with <0x60>yes' in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted 'no', 7% of the ballots were invalid and 0.7% were left blank.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, one vote must be obtained by more than half of all the votes cast.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the polling stations and a recount of a non-governmental organization had announced a clear victory for <0x60>Yes', predicting him 63% to 70%.
On the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa, by the way, had demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
The “Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly,” he had assured the Ecuadorians in Guayaquil, the seat of government 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated them.
Of course, Rafael Correa was congratulated by Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez and Morales, but also by his Chilean like-minded Michelle Bachelet.
The election, held in silence under the Organization of American States (OAS) watchdog, referred to a text consisting of 444 points to secure the “new socialism” for which the president is campaigning.
The draft constitution transfers state power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to "development planning" in a country that lives largely on oil exploration by foreign companies and on the currencies that send expatriates into the country.
The project, which will be promoted by the Correa elected in 2006, also grants the Head of State greater power, which will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years each, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will make use of this power and seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The constitution also secures the principle of free medical care and education that the president has already begun to introduce in this country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population live below the poverty line.
Ultimately, it also plans to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a base for American anti-drug operations.
The 19 hostages were freed in Chad.
An Egyptian commando launched the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions, who had been captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held captive in the desert for eleven days, were returned safely and unharmed to the Egyptian capital this Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they had been liberated by an Egyptian commando in Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages arrived at the al-Maza military base just next to Cairo International Airport at around 3.30 p.m. on board a special aircraft.
They were taken directly, without being able to speak to the press, aboard a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a neighborhood of foreigners from Cairo, to be examined there.
They all enjoy “best health” and the kidnappers “were not paid a ransom,” Egyptian Tourism Minister Zoheir Garanna said on the roll.
After being captured on September 19 by an off-road vehicle safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly moved from one hiding place to the next by 35 unknown hijackers.
There are eleven tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - and also eight Egyptians: two leaders, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the agency Aegyptus, organizer of the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 members of the special forces, on board two helicopters, launched the attack at night, just before dawn.
"On both sides, shots were fired and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled," said the official, who wants to remain anonymous.
He explained that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commandos.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini reported from Belgrade, where he is located, about the role that secret agents and elements of the Italian special forces have played.
"We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence service and from the special forces," he said without further details.
He also denied that a ransom had been paid.
The night before, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped an off-road vehicle during a patrol, in which the kidnappers were located, of which six, including the Chadian leader, were killed and two arrested.
The army stated that they were linked to a rebel group from Darfur, the Libération du Sudan-Unité (SLA-U) movement, which, however, immediately denied this movement.
Letters - The Silent Majority of Culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes headlines and is a central theme of the current election campaign.
All the better.
But one area of our cultural life remains in oblivion.
Who will stand up and denounce the pitiful sums given to the small museums, the archives, the archaeological excavations, or the national historic places that starve in sorrow?
Which politician will dare to remind the German government that it is neglecting its monuments and its culturally significant buildings?
That in Quebec, as well as in Canada, there are no real laws that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is providing 3.5 million euros solely for the restoration of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau de Chinon in the Loire Valley?
Our American neighbors have written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the American, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all deputies and all districts of government, by mutual consent.
In Quebec, in the Association of Quebec Historical Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers, gathered in 211 historical societies, strive to deal intensively with history, save the numerous private archives with a few groceries, and preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the watchdogs of our cultural heritage, protesting with the power of despair when promoters and decision-makers release their bulldozers on our old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will there be a stage for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments national parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux countries want to seize the arms of the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank, which was in turmoil due to the US financial crisis: the three states provide a total of EUR 11.2 billion to the banking and insurance institution, which also has branches in Hungary.
On the weekend, the governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands consulted at the highest level, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commissioner of the Competition Authority of the European Commission.
In the euro area, Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has been ongoing for a year, so decisions now taken in connection with the bank could have a precedent character.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the respective shares of the bank to about 49 percent.
The bank will probably sell part of its holdings, primarily the insurance activities purchased by Dutch ABN Amro last year.
The shares of Fortis have started a steep downhill journey last week, in the second half of the week there were already serious crisis scenarios.
However, analysts agree that the bank, with its 85,000 employees, is far too big for a lawsuit.
The institute’s securities fell 12% to a 14-year low on Friday.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the market value of the group amounts to EUR 14 billion, which, according to management, is unrealistic.
According to the management, the USD 700 billion US bailout package and the resulting uncertainty in the markets is due to the downfall of the Fortis shares.
On Monday, however, prices rose slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed as the Bank’s new CEO.
The financial institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it has not found an interested party with a factual offer.
The Belgian government, however, was seeking reassurance - no investor should tremble for his money, it said.
There has been no panic among the customers so far, the branches of the bank have not been stormed.
In Hungary, the Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing companies its own.
Fox in the chicken coop
Because of a person’s drug use, life and health insurance companies in America often refuse to enter into a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
"There are data protection programs that link the use of the drug data in any case to the consent of the data subject.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the fox to the chickens" - quotes the Washington Post's Richard Dick, developer of the program for tracking prescription data.
Insurance companies determine the fees as well as the payout amounts in the event of damage, depending on the health condition of the customer, and should the risk be overestimated, the insurance will not be concluded at all.
Previously, the client was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only in knowledge of the results of the examination.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper method: based on the customer’s identification number, he retrieves the data of the last one and a half years from pharmacies, that is, which preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from it what disease the customer suffers and what his state of health is.
For example, if he regularly buys large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it could be inferred that his blood fat level is incurably high, which would automatically put him in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so that the insurance companies only have to do more paperwork, but there are minor difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many drugs can be taken for various purposes, such as against migraines and hot flashes, but also against depression.
The latter is a high-risk factor from the point of view of the insurers, while the ones mentioned above are not.
For the query and processing of the data, own companies have formed, which, before they obtain the data, ask the patient for his consent.
In the meantime, they have to do this by law, although injunctions have not been enforced so far.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory tests and link them to the data on drug use, providing an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, and control of its use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a separate data protection law for health data, its effect extends only to service providers in the health sector and insurance.
The bill has already been submitted to Congress, according to which the authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard sees that this is not enough, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be shared with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the person concerned can hardly prohibit access to his data, since the insurance companies do not otherwise conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are somehow left to the mercy of the fox.
Global meal plan from Marseille
European Union and India to double trade
Since the European Union and India are each other’s leading trading partners, this was the main topic, alongside other global issues, at the Ninth Summit.
Today, the French-Indian summit is also taking place, which mainly discusses cooperation in the nuclear energy sector.
While the European Union recognises that India is an emerging, democratic superpower that should be given more votes and voice in international affairs, member states have so far been unable to agree on whether or not to support New Delhi’s permanent membership of the UN Security Council.
This question was not discussed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana received the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An agreement has been reached, according to which trade will be doubled in the next five years, i.e. to increase to a good 100 billion euros.
In view of the fact that the exchange of goods between 2000 and 2007 increased from 25 billion to 55 billion, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally merged into an agreement, so that air transport will also be encouraged in the future.
By 2009, India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the pact.
The aim is to strike a balance in the currently unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union of Partners is India’s number one, New Delhi is only ranked ninth among the EU partners.
The summit was devoted to global affairs.
Among them was the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, or terrorism, which both sides strongly condemned, and the convening of a UN conference was urged.
The Doha Round should also be concluded, with both sides at fault for the failure.
The EU stressed that it is sticking to its energy and climate programme, which means that emissions of pollutants should be reduced by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed with this, as well as with the proposal to conclude a kind of global compromise at the upcoming climate summit and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
The rise in food prices should also be combated, which is why both sides support the convening of an international conference on the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, it is hoped that contracts will be awarded to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the agency, the agreement is to be adopted for 15 years.
Over 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
Over 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair is expecting more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries for the current event. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles. Turkey will be the guest of honour of the event.
The Undersecretary for the Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented at the 264 sqm exhibition space "Punto Italia".
This will be followed by a press conference near the Room structure in the exhibition hall 5.0 of the book fair: on this occasion, figures, trends and perspectives around the publishing industry in Italy will be discussed.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers decreases throughout, but especially in the adult and youth section.
Billionaire Steve Fossett's Missing Small Plane Found a Year Ago
Steve Fossett's small plane, the billionaire who disappeared on a flight over the Nevada desert on September 3, 2007, was found.
The items have been found on a 3000 m high plateau, in the area of the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes between the states of California and Nevada.
There were no human remains inside the plane.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely disproved the last doubts during a press conference: "The plane has been located, to which a troop was sent out. Now we have the certainty that it is the plane with which Steve Fossett flew on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found on or near the plane.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Department of Transportation (DoTA) said a crew was dispatched just hours after the plane was sighted, identifying the machine: the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007, after Fossett had started a three-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, some of Fossett’s personal belongings were found in California, near the border with Nevada, by a couple near their home on Mammoth Lakes.
These are two ID cards called Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett had been abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had earned a place in history through a long string of records.
In 2002, in the sixth round, he was the first person to circumnavigate the world ball in a hot air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he circumnavigated the world in a single non-stop flight with an airplane.
Among his many records is also an altitude flight of 15445 m above the Andes, but this one with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don't expect
A SUV that, due to its original design and the special line guidance, the exhausting surface and its clear angles, falls out of the conventional schemes.
With this off-roader, Mercedes-Benz has tried to breathe new life into the sector.
Especially due to its exceptional characteristics, the presentation of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be on display in the Mercedes-Benz showroom from October 17th.
Thus, the advertising drum that will accompany the appearance of the new model will also appear in a new dress, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – this is a novelty in the automotive sector in backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, which will be carried out in different phases, which will take the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in form, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special look: the new SUV will thus appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car appears to emerge from the poster on which it is depicted.
With the help of the Elumina8 technology, the new Glk is then illuminated in all its details at different times in order to reassemble it as a whole.
Without a doubt, Mercedes’ desire with this advertisement is to introduce a new type of car advertising into this rather stereotypical field.
But will it succeed in attracting the interest of future buyers? We will see.
Now it's clear who the Italian hooligans are
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk a stadium ban
Who are these 150-200 boys and girls, for whom the whole of Italy is now ashamed? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been travelling behind the Italian national team for years and which, frankly, until recently did not cause any serious problems.
Never before have there been clashes with enemy fans.
The origin of the group lies in the right environment.
The promoters come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These included other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia in Sofia.
They wear the tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: these were, however, removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their role models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a clash with a truly right-wing radical fan scene, that of Levski.
The Figc had provided the Italian fans with 144 cards for the game: all of them were issued by name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were all controlled by the viminal: among those who traveled to Sofia, no one was in an ongoing stadium-ban process.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already overloaded in this regard, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified in the riots can count on a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to stadiums across Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot in a stadium.
Lucky for you.
But now, of course, there is fear of imitation offenders, who could follow this little more than 150.
"This fire must be extinguished immediately, and that such behavior will in no way give the possibility of justification," the viminal said.
Therefore, "Eyes on above all also with a view to the game of the national team on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, in Puglia there is a small core of Italian Ultras.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sports Authority) will gather, on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the secret services, which deals with the problem of stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the anthem of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (clearly expressed in no pleasure), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francesco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously Mazzilli was the police president of Trieste, where now comes a core of supporters of Ultras Italia, founded in 2002.
It is true, Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not against the law to praise Duce, but without a doubt the behavior of these 150-200 people was a disgrace.
"I am not a sociologist - adds the No. 1 of the Osservatorio - crimes are punished in the country of their act.
Until now, this group had held back, but now it is necessary to consider what has happened and what will happen.
But we also talk about the pipes during the anthem of Mamelis: this too is not a crime, but please allow me, there is a lack of education...".
