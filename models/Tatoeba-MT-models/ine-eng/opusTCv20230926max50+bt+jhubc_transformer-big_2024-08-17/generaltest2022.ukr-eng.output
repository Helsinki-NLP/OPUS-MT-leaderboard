Thank you in advance.
In Kherson, people went to the rally again, the Russians did not have time to disperse
As told to the agency participants of the event, the Khersons managed to hold a rally before the military RF with equipment arrived to disperse the scene.
"We managed to hold a meeting. Now the RF technique has arrived there," said one of the participants of the event.
In the past, the townspeople traditionally gathered for protests in Svobody Square - near the ODA building and the regional council.
This area is now, like the building, controlled by the armed Russian troops, who use weapons against the participants of the rallies and kidnap people.
As reported, on April 3, armed Russian occupiers used weapons against peaceful demonstrators in Kakhovka.
According to Ukrinform, the residents of Donetsk regularly hold peaceful protests against the Russian aggressor.
The Russian military uses force and weapons against people, is wounded and detained.
Also, Russian invaders kidnap the inhabitants of the region.
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy awarded Kherson the special title of "City Hero".
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
Russian troops are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket-propelled fire systems and ballistic missiles.

If Nazar works from 5:30, he can use any train:
Zelensky: Mariupol – the heart of the war, will stop fighting – we will have weak positions
President Volodymyr Zelenskyy believes that the battles for the east of Ukraine and, in particular, for Mariupol, will determine the course of the war – and if the Armed Forces are defeated there, the Russians can leave the negotiations and re-occupy the de-occupied territories.
“Mariupol is, you know, the heart of this war today.
We fight, we fight, we fight.
If it stops fighting, we will have weaker positions.
They (protectors of the city – ed.) are people who have drawn on themselves a large number of enemies.
The stronger our position in Mariupol, the stronger our position will be in the east of the state, in the (area) of the SCO, and if they are stronger, then the negotiating table will be closer for us and we will have advantages in dialogue with the Russian Federation.
If we have a weak situation in all these directions, then we can not wait for the meeting.
Because then Russia will take all these steps that can lead to a return even to those cities that we have now de-occupied.
They can go for it too.
Then our situation in the negotiations will be weaker and, perhaps, not even interesting for the Russian side.
Unfortunately, we find out.
We believe in our results, in our victory.”
Zelensky also said that it is difficult to go to negotiations after the torture of Ukrainians, but "we should not lose the opportunity for a diplomatic solution if they are in us."
“People will accept peace in any case, because people want this war to be over.
On our terms, on the terms of Ukraine’s independence, but... every family has lost something – and I don’t think any peace under any conditions will satisfy them.
But if we don’t speak emotionally, the war must end with peace, or end with millions of victims.
And even where a million victims, everything comes to an end of the war.
Yes, we have to fight – but for the sake of life.
You can't fight for the dust, when there's nothing left, there's no people."

Due to the change in the aesthetics of Ukrainian literature, new concepts were needed to describe its new qualitative state.
It is the analysis of the metaphorical space of Ukrainian literature, the study of the state
Ukrainian poetic metaphor in modern literature allows you to come to the analysis of the postmodern context as one where the metaphor plays the role of an axiological criterion

The dining room needs a code.
The Main Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has published a list of Russian servicemen who participated in the commission of military crimes in the city of Bucha, Kyiv region.
According to Ukrinform, this is reported by the Main Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine on Facebook.
“Every Ukrainian should know their names!
The Ministry of Defense of Ukraine has obtained a list of 64 soldiers of a separate motorized rifle brigade who are directly involved in the commission of military crimes against the people of Ukraine in the city of Bucha,” the statement reads.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs notes that for crimes committed against the peaceful population of Ukraine, all war criminals will stand trial and be held accountable.
You can view the list at the link.
As reported by Ukrinform, Irpin, Bucha, Gostomel and the entire Kyiv region were liberated from Russian invaders.
In the liberated cities and villages, mass killings by Russian military civilians have been recorded.
On April 1, the mayor of Buchi, Anatoly Fedoruk, said that 280 people were buried in the fraternal graves.
Prosecutor General Iryna Venediktova said that on April 3, 410 bodies of murdered civilians were removed from the territory liberated from the Russian invaders of the Kiev region.
On February 24, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the beginning of a full-scale invasion of Ukraine.
The troops of the Russian invaders are shelling and destroying key infrastructure facilities, carrying out massive shelling of residential areas of Ukrainian cities and villages using artillery, rocket-propelled fire systems, ballistic missiles, air bombs.

We promised that when you go to school, we'd bring you a surprise.
Bulob great , I have money for two months rent, in Olomouc district does not matter, I will be very grateful.
Most of my acquaintances are deeply shocked by the news of the brutal harassment of the civilian population north of Kiev.
Photographs of people being tortured and shot have puzzled the entire civilized world.
Dozens of people ask each other how this could have happened in the 21st century?! How?!
But I wasn't surprised at all. It's exactly what I've been waiting for...
I took the children and elderly parents out of Kiev on the second day of the war.
Then the girls-colleagues with children, and only after that returned to the capital to work.
Since 2014, I have consistently helped the Armed Forces and have not doubted for a moment that in the case of the occupation of the suburbs of Kiev, my family will not be spared.
Because I was and remain absolutely sure that the essence of the rotten communist-KGB regime has remained unchanged since 1918.
Without terror, it simply cannot exist, it is built on terror.
In 1937, one of my great-grandfathers was shot in the prison of the city of Zhytomyr.
A few years ago, the Zhytomyr SBU had a copy taken from the shooting case of the great-grandfather: the whole case is over a hundred pages, but the sentence for execution is very simple and from that even more terrible.
The accused was illiterate, the guilt was denied.
An ethnic Pole, a Catholic, had five children, was of free people, a poor "one-way" nobleman, never walked in crutches.
The fact that they lived in hutors and had several cows was enough to put a cup and a feeder of young children to death.
My parents didn’t even know about the funeral.
The grandmother said that almost a hundred people were taken from the village and killed all but two who agreed to give false testimony.
In the criminal case, there is the name of the taper Shari.
Our former Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada comes from a neighboring village.
I believe in genetics and I will not be surprised if it was his relative who was the KDBist informant.
The apple from the apple tree is not far, as we know, falling...
The firing squad that sentenced the peasants to death were ethnic Russians.
Analyzing the case of the great-grandfather, he was interested in various information resources.
There are excellent (without sarcasm) information resources in Russia like "Immortal Baroque", which are qualitatively reminiscent of the events of those years.
Thus, in modern Russia, descendants of NKVDists have found ways to punish and destroy almost everyone who seriously investigated the crimes of their ancestors 70-80 years ago.
People who found mass graves of victims of Stalin’s repressions and publicly wrote the names of the murderers – the system first discredited and then destroyed.
It seems that the computer found files with child pornography, for it was put in prison, and there he quickly died.
KGBists are now killing those who are trying to find out the truth about the crimes of the last century.
So why are you suddenly surprised by their actions now?!
There are concentrated the most disgusting features of human nature.
On top of the thousand-year-old Ordinal tradition were imposed slavery and imperial chauvinism of the 16th-19th centuries.
And then over what turned out to be an animal genetic experiment was done, cutting out the intelligence during a few waves of red terror.
Watch the semi-French film "Czech" in 1992, that's what it was.
You saw my picture in the bathroom.
Can you ask your wife what I can buy from a cough.
Sorry, I have no one to ask.
I still wanted to ask maybe you know where the children went, because Galya can't know them

When Mrs. Shahova introduced me as an Fpoint employee, the first question was how to find a dog, how to find a moustache.
Everyone is following the Facebook page.
They were asked to convey to you greetings and say that it is very interesting for them to read the news .
They also talked about people of Roma nationality, which they have privileges in Ukraine.
And agreed that if the child comes and the parents will not understand Czech at all, then after work I can help them on the phone.
I need to change the bed linen, 2 sets.
This is what makes me happy on the holidays.

But it's not necessary. Only if it is. I'm also very grateful to you.
I was really sorry for him.
My best friend was killed in front of him.

As reported by “European truth”, Welt writes about it with reference to sources in government circles of Ukraine.
According to the publication, the corresponding proposal was sent to the Ministry of Economy of Germany on Saturday.
The cost of 100 howitzers, including a training kit and spare parts, is 1.7 billion euros.
As well as offered howitzers in the variant of BTR Boxer for 1.2 billion euros.
While tanks in battle have to pick up relatively close to the enemy's targets, the Panzerhaubitze 2000 can fire at a distance of over 30 kilometers.
As reported by the Ukrainian government circles with reference to the offer of KMW, the supply of self-propelled howitzers will take place according to a circular scheme.
The Bundeswehr will soon give Kiev 100 of its howitzers, and the gaps that have formed will then be filled with industry in the second stage.
The first new howitzers can be delivered 30 months after signing the contract, i.e. before the second half of 2024.
The full supply will not be completed until 2027.

For me, marriage is the mystery of two people who do not discuss each other with their relatives or friends.
A man and a woman decide the issues in their family, especially without the participation of relatives.
Can we be together?
It'll take some time before we're close.
Why not try it this way?
I rented a car for 9 people, we will come with Mariana and your family.

Oleg is sick - a cold and a cough. It is better that Yana does not take with her to us, so that she does not become infected
Only I'll be a little later - about 8. Can I?
I don't want a misunderstanding with you.
Because I'm worried that everything will be okay!?
Because with these excursions we didn’t even talk about it!
I understand how important this is to you!
And I'm silent about myself (for me it's just a top that I can't reach)!
How do you feel today? After the celebration?
Hi, sorry, I just woke up, I slept badly
Sorry to bother you.
I was upset that Cole and I had a bad start at translating the test yesterday.
I will ask whether Grigory Denisenko or maybe Ionashek)) to help me at least a little with mathematical concepts.
Can you and I be of any use?
If there is a chance, I want to tighten the mathematical terms for the weekend.
Geometry is difficult at all, but we have to work with the Wheel so that it was without mistakes.
Thank you for the test task.
We also have high hopes for this.
And so she is very happy with any gift
Yab wanted to connect the Internet to his Czech number
Yesterday at the bus stop 402 I met a Ukrainian - Victoria.
This girl is a child, but here she is alone... her eyes are full of tears and grief...
I couldn't stay away.
We have now agreed to be friends.
And last night I thank God for this girl, because she is the first person from Ukraine where my heart felt reciprocity.
The branch in hall No29 is specially designed for the submission and processing of applications for assistance
Turns out I ordered a replacement card.
No, I'm just a human being.
So that she wouldn't be afraid that no one would come.
I didn't go. Yes, I did. That's what I can do! The main thing is that you taught me how to turn on the oven.
Are you going out of town for a long time?
Half a year ago, at the Babin Yar Holocaust Memorial Center in Kiev, we celebrated 80 years of mass shootings by German soldiers of Ukrainian Jews in Babin Yar.
I had the honour of speaking after three heads of state, including the President of Germany.
He spoke of "the common foundation of international law and human dignity, the freedom of people to choose their path and life in territorial integrity, a peaceful and secure Europe.
We must protect this foundation – it’s also part of our responsibility linked to our history.”
If “the evil demons of the past appear today in new clothes,” he said, “then for us Germans, there can only be one answer: never again!
The fight has to go on.”
Today, Russia has attacked a peaceful country, bombards and kills thousands of civilians, starves the inhabitants of the cities it blocks and allows them to die of disease.
Russian troops carry out mass shootings of Ukrainians, even visually it resembles the shootings in Babin Yar.
For more than a month, Germans see this in the news in real time.
Yes, Germany imposes sanctions, provides humanitarian aid, as well as weapons, which not so long ago was impossible to imagine.
Germany is delaying the delivery of the heavy weapons needed by Ukraine.
But "Never again!" means not only to oppose the swastika.
This means fighting with all possible means against mass killings, genocide, war crimes and atrocities.
There is no easy way without risk and sacrifice to defeat evil and stop the atrocities taking place in Ukraine.
One song for you tonight.
We agree, arrange a tour, and write when to be collected
All sick only Lydia did not sick in them was an omicron a new type of covid
Then I'll do it tomorrow
I use this card instead of the car.
Call for documents to be delayed.

Serhiy Sidorenko: Our NATO membership has ceased to be a distant prospect
9 years ago, Ukrainian sociology showed that 67% of Ukrainians were against joining NATO and only 18% of the respondents were in favor.
After the Revolution of Dignity, the escape of Viktor Yanukovych, the annexation of Crimea and the beginning of the Donbas war, the number of NATO opponents began to fall, and the number of supporters, on the contrary, to increase.
After the start of the full-scale war with Russia, Ukrainian sociologists recorded a record level of support for Ukraine’s accession to NATO among Ukrainian citizens – more than 75%.
Despite Ukraine’s support for NATO membership and NATO’s assistance in wartime, there is now a lot of criticism at the expense of the Alliance and its member countries – for their untimely supply of weapons, their refusal to close the sky, their unwillingness to “trouble” Russia.
In addition, there is a great risk that Ukraine will be forced to abandon its membership in the Alliance because of the position of the Russian Federation, if it can stop the war, and Ukraine will receive reliable security guarantees, including military ones.
In the new episode of the podcast "Cursed Questions" together with the editor of "European Truth" we talk about how the Alliance has helped Ukraine since the Russian invasion, for which NATO should be criticized, and for which the Alliance is criticized in vain, why our prospect of membership in NATO is close, as never before in history and history.
How do you think it is here
I have a volt partner marked that my Statement is under consideration.

And take it with you for 6-7 years in the morning
Yes, it was a sick heart.
I had a sincere feeling for this man, but he did not do very well and I left him.
After a while, he came back and apologized to me.
I refused him.
After a while, he called to say that he had had heart surgery.
When I asked him to talk to me, I felt sorry for him.
I supported him psychologically for almost half a year.
We talked a lot during that time.
I started having problems at work at the same time.
His support also helped me at the time.
Such mutual help.
And I thought, maybe you really need to look at it differently.
And he offered to marry me, and two days later he died.
God has decided our fate.
What does it mean to be ready for marriage?
He only speaks in Czech.

He comes to visit you.
Please tell me, and do you have at least an approximate schedule of cleaning apartments for a month in advance, although for an approximate understanding of what days?
I don't remember that schedule.
The Russian army threatens to launch missile strikes on Kiev: they say "never before did so"
Konashenkov's direct language: "We see attempts of sabotage and the task of strikes by Ukrainian troops on objects on the territory of the Russian Federation.
If such cases continue, the Russian armed forces will strike at the decision-making centers, including in Kiev, from which the Russian army has previously refrained.
The Russians launched missile strikes on Kiev from the first days of the full-scale invasion of the occupation troops of the Russian Federation in Ukraine.
On February 25, the remnants of Russian missiles that knocked down the Ukrainian air defense system fell on an apartment building in the capital Pozniak.
On February 26, a Russian missile hit a multi-storey building on Valeriy Lobanovskyi Avenue.
On March 1, the Russians pulled into the TV tower at Dorogozhichy near Babiny Yar, resulting in the death of 5 passers-by.
On March 2, Ukrainian air defense systems shot down Russian missiles flying in the direction of the Ministry of Defense building over the Southern Railway Station.
On March 14, fragments of a downed occupier rocket smashed a house and trolleybus on Kurenivka in Kiev
On March 18, a Russian missile hit a residential compound on Vinohrady, killing one person, and injuring 19 others, including four children.
On March 21, Russian missiles destroyed the modern Retroville shopping mall in Vinohrady, resulting in the deaths of at least 4 people.
Kyiv Mayor Vitaliy Klitschko once again said on April 13 that the residents of the capital, who were evacuated from the city, are too early to return.
The military explained to the local authorities that the Russians can still launch missile strikes on Kiev, and in addition, there are many mines and unexploded ordnance on the outskirts of the capital.
The Main Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine warned on April 12 that the Russians are planning a series of terrorist attacks on the territory of the Russian Federation in order to accuse Ukrainians and justify the cruelty of the Russian army against the civilian population.
On April 1, an oil base exploded near Belgorod in Russia, allegedly as a result of an air attack by Ukrainian helicopters.
In early April, local authorities in Belgorod said that a “Ukrainian shell” had allegedly fallen near the city.
It is obvious that the elites in both Washington and Berlin are cold-blooded for the very idea that NATO fighters will shoot down Russian bombers in the sky in Ukraine.
But Zelensky doesn’t talk to them as much as he does to their voters and societies in general.
With his speeches in parliaments and in front of thousands of people in the squares of the largest cities in Europe, the Ukrainian leader is doing something that was inaccessible to any of his predecessors.
Zelensky does not convince European politicians to do everything for Ukraine, he convinces the European peoples who elect those politicians.
And these speeches, this refined fusion of strength, touch and sometimes despair, gradually reach their goal.
While the same Biden categorically opposes the closure of the sky, 70% of his fellow citizens already support this idea.
Although Paris or Brussels oppose the acceleration of Ukraine’s accession, but this process is already underway.
I understand you, so I don't want you to think we're frauds.
The money you collect is better to give to people in need.
I can come to you and on the spot we will decide. I still want to help

If you don't need a price list, I won't supply it.
Tell yourself how you want it, and I’ll do it.
You didn't want to write to me today, for some reason.
Don't worry, I didn't come here to ask for anything.

Are you all right with the idea?
You live your usual life, go to work, plan shopping, vacation.
You have dreams.
You're planning on buying that dress you saw yesterday at the mall.
Tomorrow night, after work.
Your brain can’t accept that.
He's in awe of the old reality.
You call for work, find out - go out to work today or not.
You decide to leave the kids at home.
Until something becomes clear.
There's hope... it won't be long.
Let's make a deal... something will happen.
The brain refuses to accept...
Where to go ?? I have no one and nowhere.
I've got $50 in my pocket. We spent everything we had at home.
Many of our managers have not paid wages on our jobs.
Where do I go ?? Who do I need ? How do I provide for children ? Where do I live ?
You can't take a lot of things.
You didn't take anything out of the house... you drove 1,000 miles.
You don’t know what to feed them tomorrow or not.
Every day, from morning to evening, you drag children all over Prague.
What's next? Unknown. How much is it? Unknown. Children ask for sweets. And you can't. It's expensive for you.
Of all the irons, we don’t have that.
We have a choice - to stay there and call the children at risk, or try to escape here.

We'll bake the masana and do the lessons.
These are small entrepreneurs, who in their premises and shops have volunteered headquarters.
These are tractors that actually go to the field under shelling, because it is time to sow.
These are bus drivers who today agree to go in rubber convoys to the temporarily occupied territories to bring help there and pick up people from there.
These are heroic leaders, who fearlessly go to the combat zone, calm and help refugees in wagons, and at peace stations help volunteers to load a humanitarian in the wagons.
These were car tankers that stood on the Zhytomyr road in the first days of the war and patiently served frightened and nervous people.
These are utilities, which under shelling take out garbage, repair water pipes and power lines to provide people with the necessary.
These are doctors and nurses who save people 24 hours a day, not complaining about anything, but in their free time still volunteer, collecting medicine cases on the front.
In Ukraine, juice stops when there are small leaves)
Please tell me, little children, what age do you mean?
My 8-year-old daughter, is that age acceptable?
I am looking for accommodation for me and my daughter for 3-4 days every day to come to the Czech Republic and transfer passports for visa to Canada.
In Warsaw there are a lot of people in the visa center and there is no online queue.
I wanted to come for one day, but it is far, it takes a long time by train, the baby will be difficult.
So I decided to search for accommodation in Prague or near it.
No, we're fine.

Very tasty apples, what kind of variety is this?
The head of the President's Office, Andriy Yermak, said that Russia is starting a "fake operation" on the weapons that are handed over to us by the allies.
Yermak's direct language: "They understand that they will lose the war, see their backwardness and seek to "beat" the supply of weapons by any means.
For example, one of the last fakes is the destruction of the S-300 air defense system transmitted by Slovakia.
This information has already been denied by Prime Minister Eduard Heger.
What happens next? We know the scenarios of the Russians. Name one of them.
They can launch fakes that the Ukrainian soldiers give up with weapons from the allies, and it is massed into the arms of the Russian army.
I want to immediately warn such faeries.
Because the weapon in the hands of the soldiers of the Armed Forces exclusively sends the enemy to that world.
Sorry, forgot to ask how much the bule cost per month and will it work in the summer?

The international community continues to express shock and outrage after evidence emerged that Russian forces committed atrocities against the peaceful population in Ukraine, and Moscow dismissed these reports as a “provocation.”
“Reports of killed, raped and seriously wounded by Russian troops of Ukrainian civilians are to be condemned,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern told reporters in Wellington on April 4.
“Russia must answer to the world for what they have done,” she added, noting that her government would discuss additional measures to support Ukraine in its fight against the Russian invasion.
Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kisida called the incident a "violation of international law".
The statements came after reports emerged that hundreds of civilians had been shot and thrown into fraternal graves or left on the streets in the suburbs of Kyiv, in Bucha, by Russian troops who had left the area after the occupation for several weeks.
The photos, which allegedly depict the bodies of executed civilians with their hands tied, shocked many and led to calls for tougher sanctions against Russia and criminal prosecution of those responsible.
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a radio interview on April 4 that there were signs that Russian troops had committed “war crimes” in Bucha.
“What happened in Bucha requires a new round of sanctions and very clear measures,” Macron said, adding that additional sanctions should be aimed at Russian exports of coal and oil.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said Russian troops could go so far as to commit a “genocide” in Bucha.
“We will do everything to ensure that those who committed these war crimes do not go unpunished,” Sanchez said in Madrid.
Speaking on state television late on April 3, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova dismissed the accusation as a “provocation.”
She said without evidence that the United States and NATO “ordered” images to discredit Russia.
“In this case, it seems to me that the fact that these statements were made in the first minutes after the appearance of these materials does not raise any doubts about who ‘ordered’ this story,” Zakharova said.
Earlier, the Russian Defense Ministry also stated without evidence that the image of Bucha is "another staging of the Kiev regime" and that all Russian troops left the city by March 30.
Moscow asked the UN Security Council to meet on April 4 to discuss what it called a “provocation of Ukrainian radicals” in Bucha.
On April 4, the Investigative Committee of Russia released a statement in which it announced an “investigation” on charges of spreading “consciously false information” about the actions of Russian troops in Bucha.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke on April 3, accusing Russian troops of committing “genocide” in the city, and told Kremlin leaders that they should come to Bucha to see what their military had done.
“I want all the leaders of the Russian Federation to see how their orders are carried out,” Zelensky said in a video message, switching from Ukrainian to Russian.
And there is a shared responsibility.
For these murders, for these tortures... for the shot in the back of the head,” he said.
He said that Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military should be responsible for the actions of the troops in Ukraine.
“When we find people with their hands tied behind their backs and decapitated, I don’t understand,” he said of the scenes of victims scattered on the streets of Buchi, a city about 35 kilometers northwest of Kiev.
A correspondent of the Ukrainian Radio Liberty Service on April 2 saw on the streets of a small city the bodies of what appeared to be civilians.
Only in one place did the correspondent see on the street up to 10 bodies.
AP journalists have seen the bodies of at least 21 people in different parts of Buchanan.
The bodies of one group of nine people – all in civilian – were scattered on the ground near the site, which, according to local residents, used Russian forces as a base.
The victims appear to have been killed at close range.
In general, the Ukrainian authorities said that the bodies of at least 410 civilians were found in the area of Kiev, which until last week was controlled by Russian troops.
Thank you, everything is there, we bought everything on the list.
"They were told: there is no Kiev." How the occupiers of the floor brought Ukrainians to Russia and Belarus
The Russian invasion of Ukraine is accompanied by terrible things: robberies, rapes, murders, tortures.
In this list there is another item, about which at the moment there is much less information – the removal of the local population to the territory of the enemy.
Since mid-March, Russian occupiers have been “evacuating” Ukrainians from temporarily occupied settlements to their territory and the territory of Belarus, which self-proclaimed President Lukashenko has actually surrendered to the Russian military stronghold.
Ukrainian Pravda searched the Ukrainians and their relatives to find out how the “evacuation” itself is taking place and whether there are ways to return to Ukraine after it.
The heroes of this text agreed to a voluntary and forced evacuation outside Ukraine under psychological pressure and from the deadlock.
Fortunately, they are alive and maintain contact with their relatives.
However, in view of the statements of the Ukrainian authorities, many citizens were deported to Russia and Belarus under duress.
So in Melitopol, the Russians stole the staff of the second maternity hospital, took children from there without parents, among them 12-year-old Myroslav, the daughter of the deceased Ukrainian champion in swimming Josip Zachepinsky.
The family of Alexander, Marina and their 10-year-old daughter Vali moved to Gostomel a few months before the war.
Alexander got a job at the Antonov airport, which is located 2.5 kilometers from the village.
The family settled in the territory of the military town, although it was civilian.
As true plastuns, Denis and Marina had collected alarming suitcases in advance, but did not have time to evacuate in the morning of February 24.
They did not have their own car, and the suburban buses no longer took anyone.
At about 12 p.m. on February 24, they saw helicopters with the Latin letter V, followed by the first shells.
One of them was shot in a neighboring house.
Then the family went down to the basement and stayed there for three weeks, until March 17, until the Russian military took them to Belarus.
In total, about 40 people were hiding in their basement.
Not everyone decided to go.
"On the 6th evening of February 24, people entered the entrance, who spoke neither Russian nor Ukrainian.
They ask, “Is there anyone?” – I say yes. – “Come out!”.
They searched me, asked who was in the basement, if there were any weapons.
All the men were asked if they had served in the army.
The women were told, "We have come to protect you at the direction of Ramzan Kadyrov."
It was Chechen OMON, not even the army, young guys aged 25-35.
They said: "We were helped in the war by the Ukrainians, Sashko Biliy (commanded the unit of the nationalist movement UNA-UNSO "Viking", which fought on the side of the Chechens in the first Russian-Chechen war - UP), now we came to help you."
On the third day, they asked us what we were missing.
We say that the water, with her was a big problem.
They broke the store, took the goods from there under the pretext of "all the Russians will take" and brought us 6 bottles.
There are still online videos where children thank Kadyrov for food.
So it was after the robbery of the store they brought a sausage and say: "We understand that this is wrong, but we very much need video for Ramzan Akhmatovich."
No one really wanted to talk, but they made a beautiful cut.
Our child there says, “You have 7 days to return our phones” – they laughed.
They were constantly separated from the Russians.
They said how good that they came, because they did not want war, the Ukrainians are supported and generally good: "Putin is a bastard, Kadyrov too, but we can not do anything, because there are our families."
And mostly they didn’t fight, but they went to rob shops, looted.
Kurei was brought, one tied to one leg of the Georgiev ribbon, and to the other – his white scotch and called it "the militia".
They came to Ukraine not prepared at all.
I do not know how their intelligence worked... When they were beaten at Bucha, so that they did not even take the dead, they asked us: "Do you have what, artillery?"
What’s more, we had small groups – the Chechens didn’t know each other, in the early days they asked for passwords to identify theirs or someone else’s.
They were with us until March 13, after which came the Russian OMON, and behind them – the Omsk landing.
They put 30-40 units of equipment between the houses – ours constantly fell into it from the "Bayractars".
But these came and told us that the Armed Forces no longer exists, but there is "Azov", and, according to their words, "Azov" so many thousand 100 in Ukraine.
The narrative "Kyiv has already surrendered" has been advancing since the beginning of March.
One day a Russian – or a landing officer, or an FSB representative – came to us and said that there would be an evacuation.
And we listened to the radio – there was about Buch, Gostomel, we thought, maybe we were given a “green corridor”.
From the very beginning, we handed over our lists to the Chechens, they promised to contact the Ukrainian command.
But we are told: "You are taken to Belarus, and then maybe to Rostov."
We say we don’t want to go there or there.
To which they replied: "Then pity the psyche of your children!"
How it worked: they drove us into the basement and started shooting from under the house – or “towns” or mortars.
And then it flew back... the neighboring houses just burned down, some of them fell down.
In our house there was a direct hit on the third floor.
Later they agreed to take us only to Belarus, promising to hand over to the border guards and the Red Cross.
The part did not go, saying that it was for traitors of the homeland - said, "you are shot there, to the organs will be sold."
We were taken through Chernobyl, on both sides of the road there were burns, broken equipment, although the Belarusians told us that the Russians took the equipment immediately to them.
A lot of capons, buried equipment and soldiers.
At the Belarusian checkpoint "Komar" we passed the improvised control, many were without documents at all, because they burned.
We were placed in the tents of the Red Cross, given tea.
And here we hear gunshots! The rocket is firing, and you can see the trace – it worked “Iskander” in Kiev.
Although these from the Belarusian Red Cross said: "No, it's planes flying, deploying on the border."
But we are from aviation, we have education, we understand what it is.
Then we were loaded into the bus and taken to the sanatorium "Chonki" near Gomel.
His manager, Wenger Vasyl Stepanovich, came and said, "Here I am, I'm from Chernigov.
But I understand that Putin and Lukashenko will not stop until these thieves of yours are caught.
The poor people are suffering!
Lukashenka is so good!
As he says, so shall it be.”
They offered to give an interview to Belarusian journalists, but no one wanted to.
The administration of the sanatorium told us: "You are already traitors!"
And the people from the Red Cross and the UN mission (at least they were called so) spread disinformation that men can not go to Poland.
Many believed in it and were afraid to leave Belarus.
But we decided to leave, even though we had a problem with the documents – the daughter did not have a foreign passport.
We had to receive it on Monday, and on Thursday the war began.
The Ukrainian consulate did not help us at all, and in Minsk at the station they said that without passports no one would take the bus.
I would like to say that our volunteers were very helpful.
We were settled in Minsk, and escorts were carried out.
There was no force in the sanatorium.
To our second group, the migration representative said that you can live here for a maximum of a week and a half, because Belarus is not Europe, there are no payments here.
We found an internal carrier who agreed to take us to Warsaw.
Driving near Mozyry (about 50 kilometers from the Ukrainian border – UP), we saw the launches of ballistic missiles in Ukraine: the rocket first takes off, lights up beautifully, and then goes off.
People who were sitting on a bus in Mozir said that the Russians there are constantly shooting from the polygons.
But I can say that the Belarusians do not want to fight at all.
Generals are dismissed from the army.
One woman told us that she would break something in her son if he was called.
However, the northern part of Belarus, where Minsk, do not believe at all.
They say, "You are a liar, and we are a people of peace."
They do not perceive that their polygons are used for shelling Ukraine.
In Poland there were friends waiting for us who took us to Estonia.
Now we are going through registration, we decide what we will do next.
In Estonia, the Ukrainian flags are now, certainly, as much as the Estonian ones.”
Marina lived on the territory of a military town in Gostomel with the family of his brother – his wife and two children, 18 and 22 years old.
On the morning of February 24, she called her nephews and asked them to collect the most necessary things and documents.
In the evening they went to sleep in the basement of the neighboring house.
Marina herself could not return home and in principle will not be able to – the house is no longer there.
No one knew anything about the evacuation.
You can't go to the center on Monday.
Thank you, we have everything.A guest we always wait for you!
Thank you for the arrangement, the butterflies are beautiful

On April 1, the mayor of Buchi, Anatoly Fedoruk, announced the glad news that the Ukrainian military had liberated the city from Russian invaders on March 31.
The next day, the occupiers were expelled from the entire Kiev region.
However, the joy that the Ukrainians should feel at this moment, was overshadowed by horror and hatred, because at the same time it became known that in only Bucha, the Russians shot at least 280 civilians.
They were killed in the street, some were tied hands and shot in the back of the head, some of the victims were minors.
The mayor of the village Motyzhyn Olga Sukhenko, her husband Igor and son Alexander, who were kidnapped on March 23, were killed and tortured.
The bodies of Olga and Alexander were in a fraternal grave, Igor was in a sewer.
On the other side of the road, 20 km from Kiev, the bodies of several naked women, wrapped in a blanket, were found.
The Russians tried to burn them.
If I go home, there will be no one.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that certain types of weapons provided by Western partners arrived too late.
He said this in an interview with the Associated Press, excerpts of which were published by the Office of the President, writes "European truth".
“All the equipment, everything they already send, for some types of equipment it’s done late.
So what if, for example, we are talking about Mariupol when you lose thousands of people, and now what?
From the leaders of some countries I see 100 percent support, that’s really true.
And some European leaders have changed their position, but you see the price of these changes,” Zelensky said.
When asked whether Ukraine had enough weapons to make a difference in the war, the president replied: “Not yet, not yet.”
The president also said that if Ukraine were a member of NATO, this war would not be, or it would have a different look.
“It would have unfolded differently, we would have the shoulders of close neighbors, we could fight together.
But I am sure that there would be no war anyway," he added.
We will remind, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom promised Ukraine new military assistance, including armored vehicles and anti-ship weapons.
I have a dream that the war is over and I can go home.
Write to me about anything you need, please.

If that is the case, then I can, for example, go to work several days a week for several hours.
For exactly how many hours and on what days I will see how I will go out, so that I am fashionable and to clean apartments to walk, there for cleaning more pay so I do not want to give up that work.

He was a very wealthy man, after some time he called and reported that he had had heart surgery.
When he asked me to just talk to him and support him, I felt sorry for him.
He was a very rich man and he thought I might be his toy and I might need his money.
And then he made me an offer.
“There was a car in my yard that looked like a crocodile, and it let go of its chest.
And they kept me in the house, then they took me to the basement, and there were a lot of people, about 400 people, there was nothing to breathe.

"I tell her that the 'repair of the TV and radio' has been delayed due to import details, and friends and acquaintances have been warned not to overdo it when they call."
"We've been hiding information about the war from our mother-in-law for a whole month.
So far it has succeeded.
However, in Plamka (cat – UP) on the muzzle and hind legs, fur is overgrown – it can be from stress, changes in food and lack of vitamins.
The last two reasons have been eliminated, but the stress does not depend on me, unfortunately.
The band, unlike the mother-in-law, is not deaf, hears both sirens and explosions.
Due to the fact that Olga does not hear well and spends most of her time in her room, her bride for a month lived in the apartment with her "incognito".
On April 1, 93-year-old Oksana Polova took up arms for the first time in her life.
"For 33 days I lived with her in an apartment as a partisan.
The war was hidden from her, and the fact that I was there – formally came as always for a few hours.
But when her friend spoke, I gave her a receiver – she listened for 4 hours, then sang for 2 hours.”
The radio was always near the bed.
Most of the time the mother-in-law spends in her room.
It’s bad news – it has allowed me to be invisible to her.
If I heard the sound of her footsteps, I was hiding in my room.
First of all, she hid the receiver and the TV from her.
Then I called everyone who was talking to her. That's 6-7 people.
She asked me to talk to her about anything but war.
I ask my friend, she was there from the beginning to the end
April 17 - I have a cleaning of 2 apartments :)
Good evening, I never thought about it :)
Hello, if tomorrow we need more help we can come

I'm telling you the embassies are just here,
The British, who defended Mariupol in the ranks of the Armed Forces, says that they are ready to surrender to the Russians
The Briton, who is a serviceman of the Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which is taking part in the defense of Mariupol, told his friends and family that they will make weapons and surrender to the Russian invaders.
Source: Twitter page of Aiden Eislin, a British soldier who has served in the Armed Forces since 2018, Air Force with reference to Eislin’s family and friends, Atlas News with reference to the words of Eislin’s friend who spoke to him
"We received a message from him: 'It's been 48 days, we've tried everything possible to protect Mariupol, but we have no choice but to surrender to the Russian troops.
We have no food or ammunition left.
Thank you all, I hope that the war will end soon.”
Details: Eislin served in the 36th Separate Marine Brigade of the Armed Forces, which is involved in the Mariupol Defense Operation.
Air Force journalists contacted the mother of serviceman Ann Wood, and she confirmed that her son had told her on the phone that they were planning to surrender in captivity.
A friend of the military's Brennan Phillips also confirmed to reporters that in the last phone call, Icelyn said about their unit's plans to surrender.
According to him, the brigade ran out of ammunition and food.
Journalists for Atlas News contacted his friend, who said Eislin’s unit intended to surrender to Russian units in order not to fall into the hands of so-called “Kadirov” units without weapons and bullets.
Also in social networks distributed an audio recording of a telephone conversation, on which Eislin allegedly speaks with his familiar American friend, who plans to go to Ukraine.
In the conversation, Eislin said that they tried to get out of the city in civilian clothes, but they failed.
Earlier, the British told that on Instagram he was threatened by representatives of the private military company "Wagner".
Eislin was a social worker in the city of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, but in 2015-2017 went to take part in the fighting against terrorists of the so-called "Islamic State" in Syria.
In 2018, he officially joined the ranks of the Armed Forces and took an oath.
Eisla's friends and relatives called him Johnny, and on social media he is better known under the nickname Cossack Gundi.

Attackers-Bolsheviks for their losses in the battle played to the full.
The teacher Dmytro Pavlytskyi, his unknown relative, young Boris Alexienko, was shot.
Their bodies were thrown into a “deep wash-out pit that was filled with earth.”
“There was a dead silence in the city.”
Sometimes one of the residents ran from house to house through the fire.
On the streets, there were always bodies ridden by the Bolsheviks

I am not afraid of jobs, as I also lived in the village, so I can and I like to work physically.
When you can bring things
You have a very interesting tradition, we go so on Christmas
Last week, the Verkhovna Rada adopted bill 7176, which is entitled "On the monitoring of potential threats to Ukraine's national security in the economic sphere".
Surprisingly, in fact, the only potential threat to the national security of Ukraine in the sphere of the economy was ... the place where the members of the supervisory board of state companies and state banks meet.
The initiators of the bill believe that decision-making by the supervisory board of a state-owned company in conditional Kyiv can somehow solve the problems of national security of Ukraine.
We are aware of a large number of new threats to state-owned companies, but we do not yet know of any company that has a need to physically hold a meeting of the supervisory board at the location.
The potential threat from such a law is clear – it is a great basis for “to bear” all the gains in the difficult reform of state-owned enterprises after the Revolution of Dignity, including independent supervisory boards, and then to establish manual management.
Just like it was before 2015.
Why do state-owned companies have supervisory boards and who should join them?
Moreover, if one harmful bill flies under patriotic slogans, others can fly tomorrow – for example, it is possible to abolish the state procurement system through ProZorro or the independence of the NBU.
Much can be written about war.
By the way, this initiative appeared even before the beginning of the war and the bill 7176.
Thus, on February 22, this norm was included in the comparative table of the bill 5397.
And in general, the desire to disperse the supervisory boards in one way or another has been circulating among some of the popular electors for a long time.
Not for the sake of criticism as such, but in order to show the possible consequences of the bill, we will consider the arguments that explained the need for its adoption.
And then we will make our proposals on how to solve the issue of state enterprise management during the war.
First Deputy Minister of Economy Denis Kudin explained the need for such innovation with the risks of losing the Internet and other means of communication, which will make remote work of supervisory boards impossible.
In other words, the risk is that the supervisory board will not be able to make the necessary decisions, in connection with which the work of the company can be paralyzed.
We agree that there is such a risk, but will it be able to prevent the members of the supervisory boards from moving to Ukraine?
Imagine a rather cynical situation when independent members of the supervisory boards (who make up the majority of the entire composition) put their personal security above the interests of the company and refuse to come to Ukraine.
In this case, according to the draft law, they can be dismissed.
And then, most likely, this will lead to the loss of the quorum necessary for the supervisory board to make any decisions.
Instead, it will not be possible to quickly appoint new independent members of the Supervisory Board, since the law provides for the need to conduct a competitive selection, which on average lasts 3-4 months.
Therefore, the proposed bill 7176 decision probably will not be able to save from the loss of the supervisory board the opportunity to make a decision, but on the contrary will lead to this!
The MP, author of the bill Dmytro Natalukha provides other arguments in support of it.
In particular, he notes: "many enterprises, in particular the defense and industrial complex (DIP), now need relocation" and therefore "it is difficult to imagine that a person can, for example, from Vienna to Zoom to discuss addresses and other sensitive information".
For starters, there are almost no state-owned enterprises in Ukraine that have supervisory boards.
The Supervisory Board is except in "Ukroboronprom", which in essence and manages almost all state-owned enterprises of the OPK.
But even in Ukroboronprom, according to the legislation, the Supervisory Board has quite limited powers, and all its members perform duties on a non-free basis.
All power in Ukroboronrom belongs to the Director General, who, incidentally, will make a decision on the necessity of relocation of a particular enterprise of the OPC, which is part of the concern.
In addition, such an argument does not stand up to criticism also because the bill 7176 does not make any changes to the legislation regulating the activities of state-owned enterprises of the OPC.
Mr. Dmytro on his Facebook page also cites arguments that can be attributed to the category of "emotional".
Such arguments, as a rule, have nothing to do with increasing the efficiency of state-owned companies and state banks, but let's try to understand some of them: "respectful experts-foreigners with the first word "war", in 2021 leave Ukraine, but at the same time remain members of the supervisory boards.
First, it is manipulation – most of these supervisory board members have never lived in Ukraine and only periodically came here.
Therefore, to say that they "leave Ukraine", to put it mildly, is unfair.
Secondly, as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, both foreign and Ukrainian members of supervisory boards have long resorted to the practice of online meetings.
This tool has long been common in world practice, and in completely different areas: business, education, medicine, etc.
It should also be remembered that membership in the Supervisory Board is not a full-time job.
As a rule, such people have a different occupation, and it is the means of electronic communication that help them in this.
Thirdly, all these statements are read as claims exclusively to foreigners.
I wonder why Mr. Dmytro does not make identical claims to the members of the supervisory boards who are Ukrainians?
They are also not in their company’s location.
By the way, this is not the first populist attempt by MPs to remove foreigners from the supervisory boards, and war is only a new convenient opportunity.
Hello. I am in Ukraine. I am looking for possible options for temporary shelter in the family. With me 2 children.

We usually need an adult’s passport.
In the Brovary, Vyshhorod and Buchansk districts of the Kiev region, which were liberated from the occupiers, will introduce a reinforced commandant hour for 2 days.
The direct language of Pavlyuk: "In the settlements of Brovarsky, Vyshhorod and Buchansky districts, which were under Russian occupation and were liberated by the Ukrainian defense forces, the curfew is strengthened!
On the territory of these cities and villages the restrictions will apply from 21:00 on April 2 to 06:00 on April 5.
Details: According to the head of the Regional Administration, at this time it is strictly forbidden to be on the streets of settlements and in other public places, to move by transport and on foot.
Residents can go outside only during an alarm to go into hiding.
Such restrictions are introduced in order to remove the consequences of Russian aggression – to clear and mine the territory.
Omelyanuk urged people who have left these areas so far to refrain from returning home.
On the rest of the territory of Kyiv region, the curfew will last daily from 21:00 to 6:00.

The Serbian defense budget has grown in geometric progression for several years in a row.
In total, over the past six years, Serbia has invested more than two billion euros in the modernization of the army, the upgrade of military equipment and the acquisition of modern systems, rising to 22 places in the list of the most powerful military states in the world.
After the full-scale aggression of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, Western countries took quite seriously the prediction of a possible escalation in the Balkans.
For Ukraine, this means that the diplomatic solution to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is complicated and globalized.

The security forces of the Lukashenko regime detained three Belarusians for 27 and 28 years, involved in the destruction of two relay cabinets of the signalling plant near Osipovichi, which provides the movement of railway trains.
Source: "Radio Liberty", human rights center "Viasna", head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs Gennadiy Kazakevich, quoted by the state news agency "BelTA"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus reported that on the night of March 30, three residents of Bobruisk were detained, one was injured, due to the force support of the special commanders of the SOBR.
According to Vyasna, during the detention, the men actively resisted and tried to escape.
The security forces used their weapons.
One of the detainees was injured and is in a medical facility.
Others were given medical assistance on the spot.
The head of the criminal police of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Belarus Gennadiy Kazakevich said that "acts of terrorism on the railway of the Republic of Belarus will be strictly stopped" by security forces using weapons.
On April 6, it became known that on March 30, the police detained another employee of the Belarusian railway, an employee of the Baranovitsa branch of the "BZHD" and the administrator of the thematic resources of the "BZHD" in "VKontaktie" and "Odnoklassniki" Valentin Samasyuk.
Where he is now and in what state is unknown, reports @belzhd_live.
At the end of March, at least 40 railway workers were detained in Belarus for sabotage.
The formation of BYpol, declared by the Lukashenko regime as extremist, continues to call on Belarusians to carry out sabotage on the objects of rail transport and infrastructure of Belarus within the framework of the "Victory" plan.
The Belarusian “Rake partisans” are thus trying to resist Russian aggression against Ukraine.
As you know, through Belarus, the Russian Federation is transferring to war, to Ukraine living power and technology.
This is to raise self-esteem

Even a separate law has been passed on this issue.
We've been here for four days, so it's just a horror, not a road.
We went through the Kiev region, the city of Irpin, then there was horror, shooting, sirens.
I worry about them too.

Yeah, I'll tell them, I think they'll be home.

Temporarily for the period while we are looking for a university, then of course you will need permanent residence
but maybe it will be a hostel. (we are looking for Prague, Brno, and other places)
We are now a week from Prague, we have a car, we are ready to partially pay for accommodation.
city or village does not matter, it is desirable that it was a separate accommodation.
I bumped into something in the water and connected two unnecessary actions for which the funds were withdrawn and I can not disable them.

I don’t know why the money was taken.

U.S. bans investment in Russia and imposes sanctions on Putin's daughters
The United States, together with the G7 and the EU, are imposing new sanctions against the daughters of Russian President Putin, the largest Russian banks Alfa Bank and Sberbank, as well as prohibiting all new investments in Russia.
This is stated in the report on the White House website.
Sberbank is the largest Russian financial institution owned by the government, and Alfa-Bank is the largest private bank.
The sanctions will freeze any of their assets related to the U.S. financial system and prohibit U.S. citizens from doing business with them.
In addition, the United States will introduce a complete ban on new investments in Russia.
To this end, U.S. President Joe Biden will sign a new decree that includes a ban on new investments in Russia by U.S. citizens regardless of their location.
“This step is based on the decision taken by more than 600 multinational companies to leave Russia.
The exit of the private sector includes manufacturers, energy companies, large retailers, financial institutions, as well as other service providers such as law firms and consulting firms,” the White House said in a statement.
The third step of new sanctions from the United States were restrictions against large Russian state-owned enterprises in the critical sphere.
This will prohibit U.S. citizens from operating with these organizations and freeze any of their assets in U.S. jurisdiction.
A detailed list of the Ministry of Finance will be published the next day on Thursday.
And the last part of the package is the complete blocking of the assets of Putin’s adult children, the wife and daughter of Lavrov’s foreign minister, as well as members of the Russian Security Council, including Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.
The sanctions remove them from the U.S. financial system and freeze all assets they hold in the United States.

My name is Olga, before the war I worked as a flight attendant of SkyAp company, my mother - a seamstress of industrial products, my son Makarchyk went to kindergarten.
We lived well, but we did not even think that we would have to run, because there is no strength to hide in the grave.
I was lucky enough to find a job in Prague, Czech Republic.
Therefore, we hope that for the first time someone will shelter us) We can even pay for a room or apartment, but if it is in our pocket.
We guarantee cleanliness and order.
We don’t have bad habits.
We will be grateful for such help in such a difficult time for us.

I explained to Margarita how to fill out all the documents.
I hope she understands everything and does everything well.

Tomorrow I hear, the Internet is not working well.
You’re happy what you’re going to do.
Thank you .. we found something from things, but nothing from the technique...

Nothing's happening.

We'll do it somehow.
But how will it be paid, please, no credits.

Do you only have a father who speaks and understands Russian?
On what day does a colleague want to do house cleaning and how many houses have windows?
I'm ashamed to distract you from your business.
Good evening, I can not not not share with you. There is a message from Mariupol for his son - alive and in good condition.
Raju to read Joe Dispensz, he scientifically conducts experiments on the influence of external factors and the formation of new neurons of connections
The journalist of the TV channel "1+1" Natalia Nagorna released a video on the morning of April 12, which was transmitted to her by the military 36th Marine Brigade from Mariupol.
In it, the military says that they have no weapons left to take part in the battles, and the mountain of the wounded.
They said, "the bill goes on for hours."
Before that, on April 11, the 36th Separate Marine Brigade, which participates in the defense of Mariupol, published an appeal to Ukrainians in Russian.
The statement said that April 11 could be the last battle for the defenders of Mariupol, and the Ukrainian military command did not contact the fighters for two weeks.
The social networks expressed skepticism that the statement was published in Russian.
The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine Valery Zaluzhny assured that the link of the command with the defense forces in Mariupol is, and the details of the defense operation should not be the subject of public discussion.
The Russians threatened to block Ukrainian fighters on the territory of the Azovstal plant in Mariupol and use chemical weapons against them.
On the evening of April 11, Russian occupiers threw a poisonous substance of unknown origin at Mariupol.
As reported by the leader of "Azov" Andriy Biletsky, the Russian army used chemical weapons over the plant "Azovstal", which are held by the fighters of the regiment "Azov".
Thank you, I will adjust to you. It would be very good
The situation is the same while we are here.

Two Transcarpathian and two Czech brothers "birds" sent to Ukraine yesterday thanks to the deputy of Mukachevo city council Volodymyr Labutenko.
Today, their inter-mountain friends, led by the head of the village council and coordinator https://www.facebook.com/examplehere101/ Vasily Shchurom, delivered the drones to their destination: they were received by special units of Ukrainian troops in different cities where the fighting is currently ongoing.
In order to use copters as efficiently and safely as possible, the location of the copters will be kept a secret.
Four friends who help the Ukrainian army from the Czech Republic do not plan to stop, say: in the coming days will send many more interesting "gifts" to Ukraine, which will serve to destroy the Russian occupier and save the lives of Ukrainian heroes.
Don't worry, it's okay. I love sweet, but I can do without it
I'm worried we won't make it.
I'll be back in Ukraine soon, I'll be back to work.
Okay. If all goes well, I'll agree
I will try it myself, but if there are problems I will write to you if I can?
The main thing is to understand each other.
We were personally in the old lady in the village in Job,she saw me and that I am pregnant but said that there is no housing
Maybe she'll be happy and she'll be in a better mood.
I got my phone repaired today.
And I think I'm still freezing on the street today.
I drank medicine and tea, I feel worse, but not critical.
I'm sorry too, but I'd better meet you when I'm healthy.
When you have time, give me the music you like.
I wonder what kind of music you have in your head.
Mom and Dad need to listen.
You'll find him somewhere near your little brother's stroller.
Today it was colder here and rain. Tomorrow should be warm.
But not the pity of destroyed houses, the pity of the people over whom the occupiers are offended
In Kherson, the occupiers mocked the memorial "Glory to Ukraine" in Kherson on Perekopskaya street.
Details: It is noted that the unknowns broke the flag of the European Union, smashed the panels with photos of the Celestial Hundred and the dead in the Russian-Ukrainian war.
The occupiers took down the portraits of the heroes of the Heavenly Hundred and the dead participants of the Russian-Ukrainian war.
Take down the flag.
Good morning, thanks to the children for the carol, we do not have such a habit so we did not know, gave the children only chocolate and cookies, maybe something else was needed to give
There is someone in Czech to talk to, if anything.
Because I live like in a dormitory. By twelve, there will be people here, and then they go to work.
Hey, it's a little better.
I was already in the barn today.
I slept there even today.
We have already made great progress.
I’ll definitely be bringing the vareniks another time!
I don’t have the strength to do them.
Since I push back from the days and times when there is work on cleaning apartments after guests, I can say about April a month because I already have an approximate schedule for cleaning apartments.
For the month of May - I can roughly say at the end of April or at the beginning of May.
I just asked if you had anything to say about it.
Hi, sorry that I did not write off for a long time cooked dinner and slept a little
If you don’t mind, could I come today?
or we will meet after your arrival)
He is modest, he has been studying a lot lately. I realized that he needs it very much in life
Hi, everything went very well.
I was a little shocked to be working with people in such a high position.
Today I had a lesson from the lady who is the director of the department of economy of the highlands.
She was very pleased with my work.
I was behaving well in the cranberries.
On Monday I have to bring confirmation of employment as well as cash payment for the cr<0xC3><0xA8>ches.
I've been limping since Friday.
I don’t do anything but sleep a lot for them (and drink a lot of water <0xE2><0x98><0x9D> <0xE2><0x98><0x9F><0xE2><0x9F><0x8F><0xC5><0xBB>)
If I go to the doctor tomorrow, I’ll go with you.
I need to get another analysis.
You won’t have to go again.
The drain tank works very poorly, it washes poorly. A master is needed. It should be set up.
So that's all there is.
Can you send me the correct e-mail address?
I want to send you an invitation to the Czech language course you have signed up for.
Do the children feed there or do they have to bring them with them?
And now for a moment you can come to you there is one question
If you still need help, write.
If I'm not mistaken, you're celebrating Easter today, right?
We didn’t really want you to raise money from the beginning, so people wouldn’t think we were speculating on that!
But for online filling I did not have two items:
I will go to bed to rest. Gain strength and energy. Thank you for today's gift.
It's a great idea. I'll watch the video now. It will be good because the whole family will draw.
Karazin University urges employees and students to carefully check any information, not to trust anonymous sources in messengers and social networks, rumors and gossip.
Focus only on the official information.
You can count on me, thank you!
My other brother, who stayed in Ukraine also helps the army
I’ve done a lot of work for my portfolio.
After the holidays, the Internet should be held.
I would like to be your backup designer.
How to count the day that I was not at work there is a pass
The establishment of the headquarters: Russia is preparing a provocation in Transnistria to accuse Ukraine
The Russian army may resort to provocations in the Transnistrian region of Moldova to accuse Ukraine of “aggression against the neighboring state”.
Literally: "It is not excluded that the armed forces of the Russian Federation carry out provocative actions on the territory of the Pridnestrovian region of the Republic of Moldova in order to accuse Ukraine of aggression against the neighboring state."
Details: The enemy continues to create an offensive grouping of troops for action on the Slobozhansky direction.
In the next few days, the occupiers will probably try to resume the offensive.
In addition, the enemy continues to train and send personnel, weapons and equipment to participate in hostilities on the territory of Ukraine.
Training of weapons and military equipment is carried out at the point of permanent deployment of the 60th separate motorized rifle brigade (Monastyryshche) of the 5th General Army of the Eastern Military District.
It is likely that these weapons will be moved to the temporarily occupied territory of the Donetsk region.
Also, in order to restore the personnel of the battalion tactical group units from the 36th separate motorized rifle brigade (Borza, Zabaykalsky Krai) of the 29th General Military Army of the Eastern Military District, a recruitment of military personnel is carried out.
A special problem of the enemy is experienced when filling the positions of drivers and mechanics-drivers.
The departure of the selected personnel from the point of permanent deployment is planned for the second half of April this year.
Probably, the enemy, in order to disrupt the supply of goods to the places of conduct of hostilities, will continue strikes on the objects of transport infrastructure on the territory of Ukraine in order to destroy them or bring them out of order.
Certain units of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Belarus continue to carry out the tasks of strengthening the protection of the Ukrainian-Belarusian border in the Brest and Gomel regions.
In the Slobozhansky direction, separate units from the 6th Army and coastal troops of the Northern Fleet continue partial blockade of the city of Kharkov, artillery shelling of certain areas of the city continues.
In the Izyum direction, aerial reconnaissance of the area continues in order to identify the positions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
For this, the enemy uses the UAV "Orlan-10".
By force to two battalion tactical groups, the enemy tried to attack in the directions of the settlements of Dovhenke and Dmytrivka, was unsuccessful and left to previously occupied positions.
In the Donetsk direction, the enemy's main efforts continue to focus on taking control of Popasna, Rubizhne, Nizhne and Novobakhmutovka settlements, as well as establishing full control over the city of Mariupol.
The enemy tried to carry out assaults in the Golden area, was not successful.
In the city of Mariupol with the help of artillery and aviation, the occupiers continue the assault in the areas of the Azovstal plant and the seaport.
By the forces of separate units, the enemy carried out artillery shelling of the positions of Ukrainian troops in the areas of the settlements of Vysokopillya, Trudolyubivka and Maryanske.
On the territory of Donetsk and Luhansk regions, the defenders of Ukraine in the past day repelled four attacks of the enemy, destroyed five tanks, eight units of armored vehicles, six units of automobile equipment and eight artillery systems of the enemy.
Don't understand your thoughts?
We'll try to make it, but I doubt it.
How can you want to sleep and I'll hold you
You sure you don't mind if I come?
Maybe you just don't want to see me today, so tell me, I'll understand)
Thank you. We did not watch TV at home and more than 1+1. We do not need to configure :)
I will turn on the TV only in order to listen to the Czech language
I'm running out of money for a month :)
Can we do this on the phone today?

Hello, we are the things you brought, but are there things that the little ones can bring you in 10 minutes?
I thought about work.
If the director arranges, then from next week I can start going to work because tomorrow before lunch I plan to go to the work desk to submit documents (if it happens, because very large queues) and on Saturday rain :)
I am looking for a team at the beginning, I really liked chemistry at school, I study Czech to know perfectly, I dream to work for you
Friends are old and not very, friends with whom I am not personally acquainted, friends in spirit and mind.
Now you too have had a hard time.
Over the past month, I have spoken to many of you.
Your life, which has never been easy, has turned upside down, as has the life of every Ukrainian.
Many of you are fleeing Russia.
And many of you have admitted that you feel guilt and shame over your country’s actions toward your neighbors.
That's why they're suing Ukraine on your behalf.
Some of you activists have been under threat for a long time, and you have been preparing for a decisive strike.
In early March, I wrote to Oleksandr Cherkasov, my very old friend from Memorial.
I will tell you a little later, – as usual, answered Sasha laconically. – Now after the search we go through the ruins.
Others – cultural figures, artists, critics, writers – are impressed by the sudden collapse of your fragile world.
None of you likes Putin and his regime of thieves and fascists, most of you hate them.
But let’s be frank: with the exception of very few of you – those who worked in the Memorial, the New Newspaper, the Echo of Moscow, the Medusa, the Navalny organization and a number of other places – did many of you at least do something to oppose this regime?
Except for the fact that they were participating in rallies when they were still taking place.
Read also the column of the Russian journalist "To be late to hide, to be late to be silent"
And if so, are you sure that your sense of shame and guilt is not just an abstraction?
Perhaps they are caused by your long-standing indifference to what is happening around you, your apathy, and your passive complicity, which is now probably a great burden on your soul and heart?
That wasn't always the case.
In the 1990s, there was a short period when you had a certain amount of freedom and democracy — messy, even bloody, but real.
But the year 1991 was no better than the year 1917.
Why is it that every time you finally have a revolution, you end up with such a strong fear of embarrassment that you are looking for salvation behind the back of the king, whether his name is Stalin or Putin?
No matter how many people he's killed, you still think it's safer around him.
In fact, mistakes were made.
Instead of capturing and publishing the archives of the KGB, as the Germans did with the staff, you took your soul to the monument of Dzerzhinsky – and allowed the KGB to sink, upgrade, reform and seize power over the country.
When you were faced with the choice between robbing the country and returning the communists, you did not fight for the possibility of a third option – and you humbly reconciled with robbing.
In 1998, your economy collapsed, and this marked the end of mass rallies for great social justice or against the war in Chechnya.
The main concern was survival.
Then Putin appeared. Young, enterprising, aggressive, he promised to deal with terrorists and raise the economy.
Few of you bought it, but you either voted for it, or preferred not to vote at all.
When he began to level Chechnya again with the ground, most of you closed your eyes to it.
I remember those years well.
I was working in Chechnya at the time, helping the victims of Putin’s “anti-terrorist operation”, and I saw with my own eyes the ruins of Grozny, Qatar-Yurty, Itum-Kala and other cities.
Sometimes on the weekend I returned to Moscow and had fun hanging out with you, my friends.
We drank, danced, and sometimes I tried to tell you about the horrors I witnessed: the torture of civilians, the killing of children, the soldiers who sold the bodies of the dead to their families.
You said to me, "Brede, we're tired of your Chechen." I remember those words very well.
In response, I was outraged: "Friends, this is not my Chechen, this is your Chechen.
This is your country, damn it, not mine.
I'm just a stupid foreigner here.
It is your government that is bombing one of your cities, killing your fellow citizens.”
But no, it was all too difficult, too painful, and you didn’t want to know anything.
Then came the economic rise in the middle of the zeros, caused by rising oil prices and Putin’s willingness to look through his fingers at the fact that part of the stolen money will remain in the pockets of the middle class.
Many of you have started to earn well, some are rich, and even the poorest of you have bought new housing and found a better job.
Prices have gone up, is that a problem?
Moscow festively shined and languished from chic.
When several opponents were killed – Yuri Chekochikhin, Anna Politkovskaya, Alexander Litvinenko and others – many of you were shocked and expressed horror at what was happening.
However, the matter did not go further.
When, after two terms, Putin handed over the post of President to Medvedev, and he himself took the place of prime minister, you, as I see, barely paid attention to it.
When, after several months of Medvedev’s rule, Russia invaded Georgia, most of you either ignored it or were silent.
How many of you have I met in the following years on the mountain slopes of Gudauri, in the foothills of Kazbegi or in the cafes and Turkish baths of Tbilisi, while part of this country has been occupied by your army?
I have to admit that it is unlikely that we in the West did a lot of things, if we did anything at all.
A little outrage, a little sanctions; but what does it matter that Russia is blatantly violating international law when there is such a great temptation of Russian oil, gas and the domestic market?
Living in Russia was good.
And after the hard 1990s, it was the most important.
However, at the end of 2011, you, my Russian friends, still woke up.
When Putin again swapped places with Medvedev and took the presidential seat, as before, many of you decided it was too much, and you went out in droves to protest.
The name of Navalny became insidious, you did not leave the streets for half a year, and the regime eventually felt horrified that it was losing ground under its feet.
He then struck a blow in response.
At first, alternative actions were organized, then more repressive laws were passed, and prisons were filled with people.
Thousands of people were behind bars.
Some of them had huge deadlines.
"And what could we do?"
I’ve heard it so many times and I’m still hearing it.
“The state is so strong and we are so weak.”
Well, look at the Ukrainians.
Look at what they did two years ago.
Angered by a pro-Russian president who had betrayed their European hopes, they once captured the Maidan – and never left it.
They completely independently built a tented town and prepared for the decisive defense.
When the police came and tried to destroy it, they began to defend themselves with the help of sticks, fittings and Molotov cocktails.
Eventually, the police opened fire.
But instead of running away, the protesters went on the attack.
A lot of people died, but they won.
Yanukovych became a fugitive, and the Ukrainians regained democracy, the right to choose their own leaders and expel them if they do not do their job well.
I didn’t like Putin very much.
That was a bad example.
Therefore, taking advantage of the general confusion, he captured Crimea.
Some of you were against it, but the benefits were few.
How many of you were excited!
As far as I know, 91% of Russian citizens supported the annexation.
From somewhere a new myth was born, and many of you who despised Putin and his shaikh, suddenly returned 180 degrees and began to adore him.
I find it difficult to find a reason, because immediately after that we stopped communicating.
The rest of those who remained my friends were mostly silent.
“We are not interested in politics,” he said.
And you hid the new in books, movies, IKEA catalogs and parks, just like the new ones after the restoration, which was started by the mayor of Moscow in 2012, – with their binges, publicly accessible Weifa and hipster cafes.
In fact, Donbass is far away, and Moscow is so beautiful – and it is only getting better.
You have barely paid attention to Syria.
There were terrorists, right?
ISIL or something... Even the Moscow editor who published my book on Syria criticized it at the time in an interview, because I didn’t really understand what was going on in Syria.
Well, at least I went there and saw myself on the streets of Homs state snipers shooting cold-bloodedly at my children's peers.
Among all the citizens of Russia there were only your soldiers, who in 2015 began to bomb thousands of civilians, gaining experience for the next serious war.
Of course, many of you know the words of Pastor Martin Niemeller:
“At first they came for the socialists, but I kept silent – because I am not a socialist.
Then they came for trade union members, but I kept quiet because I’m not a trade union member.
Then they came for the Jews, but I kept silent because I was not a Jew.
Then they came for me, but there was no one left to speak for me.”
How many of you have talked about Chechens, Syrians or Ukrainians?
Some of you have done that.
But the vast majority were silent.
Some really speak now – such as, for example, Dmytro Glukhovsky, Mykhailo Shishkin, Mykhailo Zygar, Maxim Osypov and others.
Most allow themselves to speak from abroad, some from the middle of the country, like Marina Ovsyannikova, risking to get into the new GULAG or to form a company Navalny.
As for others, you know best which country you live in.
Therefore, I am sure you understand: when Putin deals with the Ukrainians – or, which seems very likely, if he does not succeed – he will take over for you.
For all of you, my friends: for those who bravely, but mostly alone, went to the protests and still held for a small period of time, but soon will get more serious.
For the thousands of you who have signed petitions, who have expressed disagreement on social networks (even if only a black square on Instagram) or who have expressed themselves in private conversations with colleagues at work.
The times when 10 or even 25 years of imprisonment were given simply for a joke, remained not in the distant past – and now they are, with a high probability, waiting for you in the future.
Who will speak for you then? Who will remain?
The example of Ukrainians – even more than in 2014 – scares the Putin regime: they prove that it can be fought.
And that mind, motivation, and courage can stop him, no matter how oppressive his preference may be on paper.
In spite of everything, few in Russia realize this, as well as the fact that the war in general continues.
But you, my friends, know very well what is happening now.
You read foreign news on the Internet, you have friends or even relatives in Ukraine with whom you keep in touch.
And Putin knows what you know.
So be ready.
You know what it's all about.
A good life in exchange for your silence has come to an end.
Your choices are just a hochma, your laws, if you don’t take the repressive ones into account, are worth no more than the paper on which they are written, your last free media no longer exists, your economy is collapsing faster than I write, you no longer have credit cards to buy a ticket for a plane ride, even if you’re not in a hurry.
Now Putin will not be satisfied with your silence, he will demand your consent, your submission.
And if you don’t give him what he wants, you can try or go somewhere, or you’ll be disappointed.
I doubt you see any other option.
Still, there is one more.
Which, in the end, will bring down this regime.
And, perhaps, in the conditions that have arisen, you will need less from you than you think.
Think about it.
The spark is not from you: because of the economic collapse that is coming on Russia, it is likely to burn up in the province, in small cities.
When prices go up and wages go unpaid, those people who voted for Putin all these years because they wanted bread and peace will take to the streets.
Putin knows this and fears these people much more than he fears the intellectuals and the middle class of Moscow and St. Petersburg, that is, you, my friends.
But if each city goes to rallies on its own, as it has done periodically, it will not be difficult for him to suppress them alone.
Organization and coordination will be necessary. The crowd will need to be turned into a mass.
You have this wonderful magic tool – the Internet, which mode can limit, but which still works and which can be set up under almost any circumstances.
Navalny's organization was defeated, but you can create others, more informal, more decentralized.
You are many, you are millions.
The Moscow police can handle 30 thousand people on the streets of the city, possibly hundreds of thousands.
If she gets more than 300,000, she'll be stunned.
We will have to use the army, but will this army fight for Putin when it comes to the matter?
After everything he forced them to do in Ukraine, everything he forced them to go through?
Of course, the danger will be very great.
Many of you will feel a sense of fear; those who have children will be afraid for them.
And it's natural, it's normal.
I would be scared if I were you, too.
On the example of Syria, and now Ukraine, Putin wanted to show you what happens to those who dare to neglect their master, who dare not only demand freedom, but really try to gain it.
But even if you do nothing, the lives of many people will still be lost in vain.
Your son will make a joke in the computer game chat – and will be arrested; your daughter will express outrage on the Internet – and will be arrested; your close friend will make mistakes – and will die in a gray room under police batons.
This is what has been going on for many years – and will only continue to strengthen, becoming more and more large-scale.
So you have no choice. If you do nothing, you know how it will end.
Act cold-bloodedly, think strategically, and make it a reality.
We were in class on Friday, we were told we could come on Monday.
We'll be home in the evening.

She had an unpleasant situation.
Because when the children went home, one mother refused to take the child, because she said that she came to look at things and lay them out in that room with clothes and Mr. Valeriy opened our children's room to her yesterday until 19:00.
