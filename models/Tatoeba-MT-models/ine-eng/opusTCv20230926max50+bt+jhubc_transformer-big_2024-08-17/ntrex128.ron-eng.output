Members of the National Assembly of Wales are worried about the fact that they might give the impression that they are "marionettes"
Several members of the National Assembly of Wales are dismayed because they have been suggested to change their title, i.e. to be called MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
This issue was caused by plans to change the name of the assembly in the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the National Assembly of Wales present on the political scene fear that this would cause ridicule.
A member of the Labour Party in the National Assembly of Wales is concerned that he is "riding with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh, "twp" means "obtuse" and "pwp" means "fecal matter".
A member of the Welsh Country Party in the National Assembly of Wales said the group was "not delighted" overall and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party said the group had an "open" attitude to the name change, but also noted that "MWP" resembles "Muppet".
In this context, the letter "w" is pronounced in Wales as well as the letter "u" in English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on how the members of the Assembly are appointed will certainly depend on the members themselves."
The Wales Government Act 2017 gave the Assembly the opportunity to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which revealed that many of them want to use the "Parliament of Wales".
As regards the membership of the National Assembly in Wales, the Commission preferred ‘Members of the Welsh Parliament’ or ‘WMP’, but the ‘MWP’ option received the most votes in the public consultation.
It appears that members of the National Assembly of Wales have suggested alternative options, but an attempt to reach a consensus could give a head start to Elin Jones, the chairman of the steering committee, who is expected to submit the bill on the amendments within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules on disqualification of members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will have the final say on their title when the law is debated.
Macedonians vote for referendum on changing the country's name
This Sunday, citizens with the right to vote will express their opinion regarding the change of the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized to settle a decades-old dispute with Greece, the neighbouring country that has its own province called Macedonia.
The government of Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a pretense of its territory and has repeatedly opposed Macedonia's accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, a vehement opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would not consider this vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is just a compromise that will allow him to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of the Episcopal Church of St. Martin have stopped ringing as a result of the problems facing the churches in Harlem
“Historically, the veterans of the place I was talking about told me that before you found a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams said.
“Today, there are no more bars and no more churches.”
He also said that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he said.
“Bars no longer have the role of a living room for the whole neighborhood, where people usually gather.”
And as far as churches are concerned, he is concerned that the money obtained from the sale of goods will be spent faster than leaders expect and that, “sooner or later, the disunity will be the same.”
He added that the churches could be replaced by residential buildings with condominiums full of people who will not support the remaining sanctuaries of the neighborhood.
“The overwhelming majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “thus this will accelerate the closure of churches, as it is unlikely that many of the people who move into these condominiums will become members of those churches.”
Both churches were built by congregations made up of white people before Harlem became a metropolis of African-American people – the St. Martin Metropolitan Community in 1870, a decade ago.
The original Methodist congregation, made up of white people, moved from that area after 1930.
A congregation of African-American people, who carried out their religious activities nearby, took over the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a congregation of African-Americans, led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who boycotted merchants on 125th Street, a main shopping street in Harlem, who opposed hiring or promoting African-Americans.
A fire that took place in 1939 greatly affected the building, but Father Johnson's enormities made plans to rebuild it and included the carillon in them.
Reverend David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and successor to St. Martin's Church, called the carillon "the bells of poor people".
The expert who commissioned the carillon in July described it as “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument”.
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also said that it was the first carillon in the world acted by an African-American musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger carillon, at Riverside Church, 18 years ago.
Merriweather said it wasn't replaced at St. Martin's.
What has been heard from St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated story, which included architects and contractors, some brought in by church deacons, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
Sacristy, the deacons’ governing body of the parish, wrote to the diocese in July to complain that the diocese was “seeking to pass the costs” to the sacristy, even though it was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some of the enorias complained about the lack of transparency that the diocese showed.
Shark Injured 13-Year-Old Child Trying to Catch Lobsters in California
Authorities said on Saturday a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old child while he was swimming, trying to catch lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack took place around 7 a.m., near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was swimming for about half an hour with his friends on Saturday morning when he heard a boy screaming for help and that he then moved in with a group that helped him get out.
Hammel also stated that he initially thought the boy was delighted to catch a lobster, but then realized that he was yelling “It bit me!
He bit me!"
The entire collarbone was torn, Hammel said he noticed when he reached the boy.
“I called out to everyone in the water and told them to get out of the water: ‘It’s a shark in the water!’” said Hammel.
The boy was taken by helicopter to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is still in critical condition.
The shark responsible for the attack is not known.
The lifeguard, Captain Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was concluded that it was not a shark species that posed a danger.
Giles added that the victim suffered trauma to the upper part of the trunk.
authorities have restricted access from Ponto beach in Casablad to Swami in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons .
Giles also mentioned that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but many of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury retailer plans to strengthen its position in the UK beauty and fashion products market
Sainsbury acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, providing areas with beautification products in the style of a universal store, with specialized sales assistants.
As part of a strengthening position in the UK beauty market, the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn mark will continue to grow, although sales of home and fashion products are not on the rise, larger areas with beauty products will be tested in the 11 stores and many will be tested in the UK.
The investment in the beauty industry comes in the context where supermarkets are looking for a way to use the previous space for TVs, microwaves and household products.
Retailer Sainsbury’s representatives said the number of beauty products it offers will be doubled, reaching as many as 3,000 products, including, for the first time, brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing games, such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees, will also receive more space, with marked areas similar to those in Boots stores.
Also, the supermarket relaunches its range of makeup products, Boutique, which means that most of the products are intended for vegans, an increasingly common demand among young buyers.
In addition, products from French retailer The Fragrance Shop will be included in two Sainsbury’s chain stores for testing, the first opening last week in Croydon, south London, and the second in Selly Oak, Birmingham, in the second half of this year.
Online shopping and the tendency to buy smaller amounts of food every day from the nearest grocery store means that supermarkets need to find new ways to motivate people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of retailer Sainsbury’s, said outlets will increasingly look like universal stores as supermarket chains try to cope with major discount stores, Aldi and Lidl, which offer more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury’s has included both Argos outlet products in hundreds of stores and Habitats since it acquired both chains two years ago, which means it has seen increases in food sales as well as increased profits.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to refresh its pharmaceutical and beautifying product compartments has failed.
Sainsbury tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but negotiations ceased after a divergence over how Boots's store revenues were distributed in its supermarkets.
The new strategy was conceived after Sainsbury sold his pharmaceutical business, which included 281 stores, to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
This means that Lloyds will play an important role in the plan, adding an extensive range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look of our districts with beautification products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in the specialized training of our colleagues, who will be at your disposal to offer you advice.
Our range of brands can adapt to all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations transform us into an extraordinary location to purchase beauty products, revolutionizing the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones is furious after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract
'Dragons' Den' TV star Peter Jones is furious after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle contract with his company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time to get involved in their Truly brand project, which includes accessories and household items.
The couple's company was compared to the Goop brand, owned by Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old show host of “This Morning” announced on Instagram that she would be retiring.
Holly Willoughby sparked the anger of Peter Jones, the star of “Dragons’ Den,” retiring at the last minute from their lifestyle services business to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was furious when one of the most beloved people on television admitted on Tuesday, during a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contracts, worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, no longer allow her to access the trusts that she had agreed to.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and nearly doubled Willoughby's fortune, with an estimated value of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
After Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he would quit his contract for Truly, Jones left the UK to take refuge in one of his holiday homes.
A source said: “Truly was by far one of Holly’s priorities.
It was going to be her long-term future for the next two decades.
The decision to step down shocked everyone.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was still a little before launch.
There’s a warehouse full of products at Marlow headquarters that are ready to be sold.”
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the presenter of the show "This Morning", which is among the best-selling stars in the UK, could harm the company by millions, as a result of investments in products such as pillows and candles, clothing and household items, as well as the possible additional delay of the launch.
It can also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three, and Dan Baldwin, her husband, have been friends for ten years with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby formed the Truly brand with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined them as a director in March.
The couples spend their vacations together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s “I’m A Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to comment on his business.”
I was very tough, and then "we fell in love"
He made a mockery of the critics he would receive from journalists for making a comment that some would consider “disgusting of a president” and for having such a positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump take such a big step back?
He said Trump was imitating a voice as a “news presenter.”
“I didn’t take a step back.”
He said Kim is interested in having another meeting after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a huge step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have ceased.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea had not observed a "appropriate response" from the United States on North Korea's previous moves.
Instead, it noted that the United States continues to issue sanctions to put pressure on it.
Trump had a more optimistic point of view in his motivational speech.
“Everything is going well for North Korea,” he said.
“We were heading for a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a great relationship.”
He also said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim had had positive results: the cessation of missile tests, the support offered for the release of hostages and the return of the US military.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s easy to act like a president, but if I behaved like that, instead of the 10,000 people outside trying to get into this inhospitable arena, it would be around 200 people,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have devastated an island, causing the deaths of hundreds of people.
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10% of the population of Lombok has been displaced, it has not been declared a national disaster, a necessary condition for triggering relief actions at the international level.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, they were very clear that I don’t ask for international assistance, so it’s kind of a difficult situation,” he said.
Although the Save the Children Foundation is trying to form a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet known whether foreign personnel are allowed access to the site.
Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster agency, said authorities in Indonesia are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international agencies can contribute to relief efforts.
Given Indonesia’s constant earthquakes, it is inconceivable that the country continues to be underprepared for nature’s fury.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, they are not very common on other coasts.
It appears that the lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although a warning has been issued in this regard, could have contributed to the loss of life.
Even under the best of circumstances, the journey between the islands of Indonesia turns out to be a challenge.
Natural disasters complicate this even more.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the earthquake victims is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has proposed that improving Indonesia’s precarious infrastructure be the focal point of his election campaign, and he has vehemently allocated money for roads and railways.
But the lack of funds has affected Joko’s administration, which will participate in a new election campaign next year.
Joko also faces persistent pressure from Indonesia’s sectarians as members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims clashed on the streets, using machetes, bows and arrows, as well as other rudimentary weapons.
Video: Daniel Sturridge from Liverpool gives the saving goal and equals the score in the match against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge football stadium.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri, while he was about 30 meters from the opponent's gate, and his team was led by Chelsea 1-0.
He hit the ball and sent it to the left before taking a shot in the direction of the gate.
The ball reached over the cue, heading towards the top right corner of the gate.
Finally, the ball passed Kepa Arrizabalaga who jumped towards her and fell into the gate.
“I just had to try to get to the ideal position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq are always trying to get ahead as much as possible, so I tried to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante coming and it was enough, I didn’t think much about it, I just took the ball further.”
Chelsea led 1-0 to the break after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The blue team striker sent the ball to Mateo Kovacic, then turned around in the middle of the field and ran to the Liverpool team's half-field.
Kovacic made a quick one-two move in the middle of the field.
Then he sent the ball to Hazard, who went into the cage.
Hazard overcame the defense and sent the ball into the net, managing to hit it with his left foot and pass Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
Liverpool will have a match against Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio Sao Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832
The number of deaths caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached 832, according to the national disaster agency, on the morning of Sunday.
Several people were trapped under the ruins of buildings collapsed by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that took place on Friday and triggered waves up to 6 meters, the agency's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000, has been covered by debris caused by the collapse of buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a woman with a knife
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Mews, on John Street, and a man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have asked people in the area who have heard or seen anything related to the matter to come to the statement section.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I appeal to all people who were near John Street in Birkenhead and who heard or saw something suspicious to contact us.
I also want to ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who have recorded any useful material using the onboard camera to contact us if they have any information essential to our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the body belonged to a woman from Birkenhead and that it had been found on a property.
This afternoon, a few people came to the crime scene who think they know the woman to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway, and police say they are trying to inform the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews tried to return to his own apartment, but was told by police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was shocked when he found out what had happened.
People living in the building were told it would take several hours before they were allowed to enter.
A police officer told a person that the entire area is now considered the scene of the crime.
At the scene, a woman appeared in tears.
He kept saying, “It’s so terrible!”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were in the perimeter and another one was outside.
A few police officers were standing in the perimeter, monitoring the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC police, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and mention case 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's Parliament statue becomes the most recent memorial to be affected by altercations over "rewriting history"
Its removal would represent a poetic justice for the Taliban-style destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts by its fanatical Puritan descendants.
But the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate about removing statues as Oliver Cromwell’s figure from outside the Palace of Westminster to become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars was neither commanded nor executed by Cromwell.
Perhaps a wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than he is today, as a defender of parliament against external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether it is an exact representation, this is the subject of an ongoing historical debate.
But surely the conflict of the mid-17th century led to the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual figure who is part of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
A pig caused the death of a farmer in China
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local news agencies.
The man, identified only by the family name "Yuan", was found dead after an artery was severed and was covered in blood near a pig farm in Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, according to the Sunday Morning Post editorial in southern China.
A pig farmer was preparing to inject swine vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly came with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs to the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby cot was open.
He said there was a large male pig with blood on its mouth in the litter.
Legal doctors confirmed that a pig weighing about 300 kg caused the death of the farmer, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were full of blood and wrinkled,” the cousin, whose family name is “Wu,” told Guiyang Evening News.
The surveillance cameras recorded Yuan entering the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The animal that caused the death of the man did not belong to Yuan, nor to his cousin.
A market representative told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking someone else, while police collected evidence from the crime scene.
It appears that Yuan's family and authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pigs attacking humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm, causing serious injuries to the man.
10 years ago, because of a 300 kg pig, a man from Wales was stuck in his tractor until his wife came to scare and drive away the animal.
After an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the taste of blood can trigger such reactions.
“They’re just playing.
They like to bite, they are very curious...they don’t want to hurt you.
You just have to give them proper respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa, which has lost its intensity, will cause torrential rains in the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is losing intensity as it moves to cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa records wind conditions at 85 km/h, being a Category 1 hurricane on Sunday, from 5 a.m. and was located about 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to arrive in the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depressed area has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastwards, toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula on Monday, in the form of a tropical storm, she will begin to push intense tropical moisture from the north to the southwest of the United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in some parts of Mexico.
Then, the tropical humidity that will interact with the depressed zone will generate abundant rainfall in the southwest in the next few days.
Locally, rainfall between 3 and 10 cm will cause dangerous rapid floods, waste flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Intense tropical humidity will cause rainfall rates of up to 5 and 8 cm per hour in certain areas, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Precipitation between 5 and 10 cm is expected in the southwestern part, especially in most of the Arizona.
Rapid flooding may occur due to rapidly deteriorating conditions as a result of the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot, given the threat posed by tropical rain.
Heavy rain could cause canyons to turn into violent rivers, and storms will bring local winds into gusts and dust.
The near-depression zone will bring torrential rains to areas on California’s southern coast.
Rainfall of almost 2 cm is possible, which could lead to minor flows of debris and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region in the wet season.
Scattered tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona in the second part of the day on Sunday and in the first part of the day on Monday, before more rain spreads on Monday evenings and Tuesdays.
Intense rainfall will spread to the so-called “four corners” on Tuesday and will persist until Wednesday.
There will be intense temperature changes in the U.S. in October as the Arctic region gets colder, but the tropics remain quite warm.
Sometimes, this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
On Sunday, dramatic temperature differences are encountered in the central U.S. area.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 10 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the prolonged heat of summer will try to form and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to face a warm early October, with temperatures as high as 27 degrees in extended areas, from the southern plains to certain portions of the northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 27 degrees, with about 4 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast indicates high chances of above-average temperatures for the eastern U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh’s audition
More than 20 million people watched the press statement supported by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of a sexual assault that allegedly took place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television networks.
At the same time, the political confrontation continued, with TV stations interrupting Friday's normal schedule for a breaking news story: an agreement between Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations for a week.
Ford told the court he was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had harassed her while he was drunk and that he had tried to undress her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an intense testimony, said he was 100% sure this didn’t happen.
According to Nielsen, more than 20.4 million people watched the hearing on Friday.
The company counted average viewing on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other networks that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people watching from the office.
To put this in perspective, this audience is similar to that for a football game in the play-off or with the Academy Awards.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, whose opinion hosts strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was ahead of all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the daily audience.
ABC was in second place with a viewership of 3.26 million.
According to Nielsen, CBS was watched by 3.1 million people, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million, and CNN by 2.52 million.
Interest remained at a high level after the hearing.
Flake was at the center of Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would vote in Kavanaugh’s favor, he was filmed by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning as protesters shouted at him and he tried to climb into an elevator at a Judiciary Committee meeting.
He stared down for a few minutes as people disputed him, and everything was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m right here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?
He was told, “You have power, while so many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office issued a statement and said, before the lift was closed, he would have more to say at the commission meeting.
Televisions later broadcast the vote live on the Judiciary Committee to advance Kavanaugh's nomination for the Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if the FBI agreed to consider the charges against the nominee next week, a move demanded by minority Democrats.
Flake was largely convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake's decision came after a conversation with Coons and several senators thereafter.
Flake's election was an important one, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Accuses Critics of ‘Political Games’ on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “political games” with Britain’s future and undermining national interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, attended the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside his front-page photo, former Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued an attack on her Brexit plan, the so-called Chequers plan, saying that the proposal that Britain and the European Union collect their reciprocal tariffs was “completely reciprocated.”
Shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of fatally shooting the LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities posted footage of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the brawl.
Police recovered the glasses from the crime scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
Following Simpson's interrogation, police say he admitted to shooting Wayde dead.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to the lawyer.
The Baton Rouge Office of Forensic Medicine released a preliminary report on Friday, saying the death was caused by a shot to the head through the neck.
The department credits the Louisiana police force, the state police forensics laboratory, Southern University police, and citizens in the area for the help provided in the investigation, which led to the arrest in question.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the police for "diligence and the pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20.
The 1.98 m tall striker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and had 2.6 rebounds.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This worries me all the time,” Wade said.
A volcano has thrown a column of ash over Mexico City.
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexico’s citizens on Saturday to keep their distance from the volcano after activity in the crater began and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitors several whorls and vibrations.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano, which is 72 km southeast of the capital, after a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with gendarmes on the first anniversary of Catalonia’s secession vote, gathering thousands of opposing demonstrators.
A group of masked pro-separatists kept away from the gendarmes bombarded them with eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that were usually flooded by tourists.
The stabbing later intensified, with the police using their batons to control the situation.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive,” while union protesters shouted “Long live Spain!”
14 people have received medical care for minor injuries caused during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in the region that wants to become independent a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by Catalan separatists.
Voters voted, overwhelmingly, to become independent, although turnout was low, and those against secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 100 people were injured last year after police tried to stop voting at polling stations in the region, with violent clashes taking place.
Pro-independence groups camped overnight on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration continued, but the protesters were forced to choose a new path.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of gaining independence from Catalonia.
“Last year I had some of the best moments of my life.
I looked at my parents crying with joy that I can vote, but now we have nothing to do,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital but narrow victory in the regional elections in December last year, Catalan pro-independent parties have tried to maintain momentum this year, with many of the most well-known leaders either in exile or in detention, awaiting trial for their role in organising the referendum.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the police protest on his phone, said politicians on both sides fueled the conflict.
“The situation is becoming increasingly tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in prison since the end of last year, announced that he would run for election to the European Parliament next year.
“As a candidate for the European elections, it is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Several men have been arrested after entering a house by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly entered a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. in Ballynagard Crescent.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and even the building.
It seems that at some point a crossbow was used against the car.
Menga's shot helped Livingston win 1-0 against the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston left the Rangers unchallenged, with Steven Gerrard reaching his second loss in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to make a difference while Gary Holt's team played at the same level as Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team is without a win in the Premier League this season and faces the Hearts leaders with eight points behind them next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers hosts Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston remains undefeated in the division for up to six games, with Holt's head coach still feeling the taste of defeat as he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses his chance against the cruel visitors
Holt's team should have advanced long before they signed, and their orientation caused all sorts of trouble for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to break in and try to shoot into the gate space, then Alan Lithgow managed to shoot wide after he slipped in to intercept the ball sent with Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were pleased to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause visitors problems with free kicks.
And that was how the crucial void came about.
The Rangers accepted a free-kick, and Livingston managed an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson collaborating to care for Menga, who shot and scored from the center of the pitch.
At that stage, the Rangers dominated the possession, but faced the impenetrable defense of the host, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was no longer at large disturbed in the rest of the match.
This pattern of play continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a defense from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was unsuccessful against Rangers' Allan McGregor, and Lithgow took a wide shot from another Livingston player.
The diagonal passes continued to come in Livingston's box, but without success, and the two penalty requests - after Halkett had abruptly sacked Glenn Middleton and after a heist - were not accepted.
"Fenomenal game" offered by Livingston – analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
They were excellent, without exception, continuing to exceed expectations on an upward trajectory.
Their style of play and the team have not changed at all since their return to the top, but the merits should be given to Holt for the way he has coached his team since taking over.
He had so many models to follow.
Captain Halkett was great, with a well-organized defense, while Menga put Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall in a difficult position throughout the game.
But the Rangers weren’t too inspired.
Although they have performed well since being led by Gerrard, they have not reached the same standards.
The empty passes were unsuccessful, they managed once to catch the opponent's gate free, and this should be an alarm signal for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan's visit to Cologne
It was all pink on Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin for breakfast.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They are unhappy about issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
In this context, Erdogan went to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish citizens in the world, outside of Turkey.
Police have invoked security reasons to prevent the gathering of a crowd of 25,000 people in front of the mosque, but enough supporters have gathered nearby to see its president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan, mostly Kurds, have made their voices heard, condemning Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him with open arms into the country.
The conflicting protests reflect the division over a visitor considered a hero by some of the Turks in Germany and an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies as a result of collision with a car
A cyclist died after a collision with a car in London.
The crash occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, at around 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped, and the paramedics showed up at the scene of the accident, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes just months after another cyclist died in an accident that took place on Childers Street, where the driver fled the scene, which is about a mile from where Saturday’s accident took place.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Access is restricted in the area, the route of the buses is diverted, and motorcyclists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in a Clashes
Six prison officers were injured in a brawl at a high-security men's prison, a prison official said.
On Sunday, a brawl broke out at HMP Long Martin in Worcestershire at around 9:30 a.m.
Specialized officers were brought in to deal with the brawl, in which eight inmates are involved, isolated in a wing.
Officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said: “The assistance of the prison’s specialist staff has been requested to deal with an incident unfolding at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff members received medical care after they were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have very clear rules regarding those responsible, who will be transferred to the police and could spend a longer period of time behind bars.”
There are more than 500 inmates in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor needed hospital treatment after being attacked by a detainee.
And last October, officers dealing with the disorder were called to prison to deal with a very serious situation, with staff being attacked with billiard balls.
Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City are in danger of being flooded due to Hurricane Rosa (dry areas can enjoy benefits as a result)
There is rarely a tropical depression in Arizona, but this is quite likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy resources of Hurricane Rosa will be used in the southwestern desert, posing a risk of rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued rapid-flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in the western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada region, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to have a direct route to Phoenix on Tuesday, and in the second part of Monday it will cause precipitation.
The Phoenix National Meteorological Service said in a tweet that only “ten tropical cyclones have maintained a tropical storm or depression at a distance of about 320 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane with action over a distance of about 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall between 5 and 10 cm, with isolated amounts of up to 15 cm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
In other areas of the southwest desert, including in the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, quantities between 3 and 5 cm will be recorded, with total possible quantities of up to 10 cm in isolated areas.
For regions outside the risk of rapid flooding, the rain brought by Rosa could be a blessing, given that the region is affected by drought.
Although flooding is a very serious problem, in some areas, torrential rain will be beneficial, as the southwest faces drought problems.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona faces at least severe drought, the second-largest category, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will lead to landslides on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which still had hurricane power on Sunday morning with winds of up to 136 km per hour, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving north at 19 km per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific, and will therefore decrease.
Thus, it is expected to produce landslides in Mexico, with a tropical storm force in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
The torrential rains in Mexico could be significant, presenting a high flood risk.
"There is expected to be torrential rain between 8 and 10 cm" from Baja California to northwest Sonora, and it can reach as high as 25 cm, according to weather.com.
Then, Rosa would head north into Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, as a tropical depression, passing through Arizona and arriving in southern Utah on Tuesday night.
“The main danger posed by Rosa or her remains is extreme torrential rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the desert in the southwestern United States,” said a representative of the National Hurricane Center.
It is expected that these rains will produce sudden floods, which will endanger people’s lives, and bring waste streams into the deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old man was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at about 4 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital, where he is in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and one 20-year-old were arrested last night in the Radstock area, according to police in Avon and Somerset.
The officers asked for the help of citizens who could have materials on their mobile phone, respectively, to report to the police station.
Trump says Kavanaugh has faced "discontent and anger" from Democratic Party
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump also said Kavanaugh faced "discontent and anger" from the Democratic Party during his nomination.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified before Congress, vehemently denying Christine Blasey Ford’s claims that she sexually abused her ten years ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her claim.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw on that day the genius, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh.
“A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote for one of the best legal minds of this generation,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president has indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he talks about the importance of Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important choices in our lives.
“I’m not a candidate, but I’m a candidate,” he said.
"For this reason, I express everywhere my positive opinion about candidates I consider to be outstanding."
Trump said Democrats were on a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate since Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, an assistant to the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesia earthquake, number rising
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them from the huge waves that hit the beaches when a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered on Friday at a festival on the beach in Palu city, when waves with a height of six meters hit the beach at dusk, people being taken by the water and destroying everything in their way.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat was issued yesterday, people were still seeing their activities on the beach and did not immediately run away, thus becoming victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the BNPB disaster relief agency, told a news conference.
“The tsunami brought with it cars, logs, houses, hitting everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami traveled at 800 km/h before hitting the shore.
He added that some people had to climb trees to get rid of the tsunami and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The photos published by the disaster agency show several destroyed buildings and shops, overturned and collapsed bridges, as well as a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the raids continued to shake the coastal city.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy emitted by Friday’s powerful earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb from Hiroshima in World War II.
The city’s geographic structure, which is at the end of a long, narrow gulf, has likely intensified the scale of the tsunami, the official added.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, in addition to the 540 people injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage could be greater along the 300-km-long coast north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the quake's epicenter.
The communications were "completely disrupted, without any information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said, adding that its staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
He added: “This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse.”
On Saturday, the agency was harshly criticized for failing to report that a tsunami would hit Palu, although authorities said the waves arrived at the time of the warning.
In posts on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami is approaching people on the adjacent street.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water hits the shore, taking with it buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the material.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which blocked communications in Palu, making it difficult to coordinate authorities’ rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending aided cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the evacuees still need food and other basic supplies.
The city's airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo planned a visit to the evacuation centers in Palu for Sunday.
The number of deaths caused by the tsunami in Indonesia exceeds 800 people.
The situation is extremely serious.
While Word Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees are housed in makeshift shelters in the office yard, they passed by devastating scenes, Doseba said.
He added: “They told me they had seen many houses destroyed.”
The situation is very serious.
Even though aid groups began to start relief efforts in the event of a disaster, some people complained that foreign workers with comprehensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, financial resources, delivery of materials and personnel can only reach the site of a disaster if it is declared a national disaster zone.
This hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Red Cross.
“After the government says, ‘Yes, this is a national disaster,’ we can begin international assistance actions, but nothing has been announced yet.”
After the second night of Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and families of the missing hoped that their loved ones would be miraculously saved from such a national disaster.
On Saturday, a boy was pulled out of a canal.
On Sunday, rescue workers freed a woman who had been in ruins for two days, with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of the national paragliding team, trained for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia, two of the missing paragliding pilots.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mandagi, were his students.
“Given the experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon told how, a few hours after the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel in the community of paragliding sports practitioners, he sent desperate messages on WhatsApp to competitors from Palu who participated in the festival organized on the beach.
But in the line of his messages appeared only a gray steak, and not two blue steaks.
“I think that means that the messages were not transmitted,” he said.
A group of thieves stole $26,750 while feeding an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who feeds an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to transport more money, Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "flew through the back of Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money to be transported.
According to the statement, witnesses noticed several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not mention the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity is asked to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his stage name to "Ye"
Rapper Kanye West changed his stage name to "Ye".
He made the announcement on Saturday about the change on Twitter: "the individual officially known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has been called "Ye" for some time and uses this title as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
It comes to the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, who canceled "for reasons of an emotional nature," the show's producer said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current stage name, West has previously stated that this word has a religious significance for him as well.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year as he discussed the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m new, it’s about us.
It all started with “Kanye”, which means unique, and it came to “Ye”, this being a reflection on our good, bad, unclear things and on the whole.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are as people.”
He is one of several rappers who have chosen to change their stage name.
Sean Combs had countless stage names, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
And a former West collaborator, JAY-Z, changed his name, sometimes with a cratum, sometimes without, as well as with capital letters.
Mexico’s president vows not to use military force against civilians
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military forces against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody reprisal against students.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador promised at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
The troops fired at a peaceful demonstration from the market on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when the students' leftist movements were entrenched in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those studying and by opening several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities attract young people to criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for AI
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, the AI investor and user who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several members of the U.S. government made AI announcements, even though the U.S. lacks an official AI strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to be at the forefront of AI innovation by 2030.
“Duplicateing the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that all other countries are far behind the US and we are looking for the next AI discovery,” Lee said.
Doubling the funds could double the chances of the next big AI achievement being made in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most prominent companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated American player Othello, who was the best in the field at the time, and later was executive director at Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China subsidiary.
Lee appreciated previous U.S. government competitions in technology, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be next, to help identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that puts hammers on academic leaders, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired outstanding university graduates to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. intensify its AI efforts.
“I think that it should automatically be offered to PhD students in AI,” he said.
The State Council of China issued a New Generation Development Plan for Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Foundation for Natural Sciences in China provides financial support to people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Foundation for Science and other government organizations provide money for researchers in the United States, but the quality of academic activity is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to engage industry partners and academics, and the White House announced the formation of a selection committee in the field of artificial intelligence.
This month, the U.S. Army Research Institute (DARPA) announced a $2 billion investment for an initiative called “AI Next.”
Also, at this time, NSF is investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, there have been no changes in U.S. law aimed at creating a National Security Commission in the field of artificial intelligence.
Macedonians will vote in a referendum if they want to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum if they want the country’s name changed to “Republic of North Macedonia,” a change that would resolve a decade-old dispute with Greece that opposed its accession to the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which includes a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the neighbouring country represents a claim on its territory and has opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The two governments agreed in June on the proposed new name, but opposition nationalists argue that this change would undermine the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had cast doubt on the presence of the vote, and it was possible that the minimum threshold of 50% needed to validate the referendum could not be reached.
The question on the ballot in the referendum will be: “Do you agree to join the EU and NATO, accepting the agreement with Greece?”.
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price that must be paid by Macedonia, one of the countries that resulted from the break-up of Yugoslavia, in order to be accepted into entities such as the EU and NATO.
“I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because it means safer lives for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, quite a few members of parliament have said they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name to be changed, a two-thirds quorum is required in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 when 66% of eligible voters cast their ballots.
“I came to vote for my children and for our place in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter from Skopje, the country’s capital.
On September 30, 2018, Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and their son, Dushko, voted for a referendum on changing Macedonia’s name, which will allow them to join NATO and enter the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small-sized scene and threw chairs in front of tents raised by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We support NATO and the EU, but we want to join them at the top, not the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we are not wanted by the name of Macedonia, we can go to other countries, such as China and Russia, and we can become part of the Eurasian Union."
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership would bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I think the majority will be in favor of changing the name, because more than 80% of our citizens are in favor of joining NATO and the EU," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a result in favor of changing the name would be "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published last month by the Institute for Policy Research, between 30% and 43% of citizens with the right to vote will participate in the referendum, under the necessary number of participants.
According to another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia, 57% of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour of the change.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the voter turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since the takeover of the government in May last year.
Video: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City manages to pass the entire Brighton team’s defence and score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to pass the Brighton team's defence and scored a 2-0 victory for Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
It seemed to Aguero that it was incredibly easy to score in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the sequence.
He moved very quickly among the three defensive players from Brighton, before reaching the free side of the field.
Then, Aguero woke up surrounded by four players from the opposing team.
He managed to pass by a defender, and then overtook several opposing players at the edge of Brighton's that team.
After that, he gave a pass to the left, the ball reaching Sterling.
The English forward sent the ball back to Aguero, who hit the ball with his right foot, managing to avoid Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan with a shot to the right of the goal.
“Aguero is facing some problems on his feet,” Pep Guardiola, Manchester City manager, told reporters.
“I talked to him and agreed to play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We’re lucky he scored a goal at that point.”
But Sterling is the one who got their initial advantage for the Azurii in the Premier League match.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero scored an in-depth pass to the Brighton team at that stage.
Then he gave a pass on Leroy Sane's left flank.
Sane dribbled the ball several times until he sent a pass to Sterling, who sent it in the direction of the gate.
The Azur attacker hit the ball towards the net just before heading off the field.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ravage the game against the Rockies
With the national team eliminated from the competition in the play-off, there were not too many reasons to force another start.
But Scherzer, being extremely competitive, hopes to win Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still play-offs implications for the Rockies, who hold an advantage with a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies have gained at least one unpredictable spot with a 5-2 win against the national team on Friday night, but are still trying to retain their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play for nothing, at least we can enjoy the atmosphere here in Denver with the crowd, and the other team would probably play at the highest level of any point I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete under these circumstances?”
The national team has not yet announced the player who will open the match on Sunday, but, according to sources, is inclined to let Scherzer take his first hit in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be at the opening kick of the game with the number 34, had a warm-up session on Thursday and will throw in normal conditions this Sunday.
The Washington midfielder has a score of 18-7 and an ERA of 2.53 and 300 in 220 and 2/3 matches this season.
Trump expresses support in West Virginia
The president referred to the situation regarding the Supreme Court’s decision on Brett Kavanaugh as he spoke about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections.
“All our efforts are at stake in November.
There are five weeks until one of the most important choices in our lives.
This is one of the big ones, not a candidate, but actually a candidate, which is why I try hard to support good candidates,” he said.
Trump continued: “You see this horrible, radical group of Democrats, you see what’s happening right now.
And they are determined to take power again by using whatever means necessary, you can see their wickedness.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, that’s what they want, to have power and control, and we’re not going to give it.”
He also said Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“And you can see that in the last four days,” he said, describing the Democrats as “angry and evil, naughty and lying.”
He referred to Senator Dianne Feinstein of the Democratic Party, who is on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which was heavily shunned by the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you divulge the document?
Excuse me?
I... wait a minute — that was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer tolerates people from a different point of view.
People who express their opinions are no longer tolerated.
It did not surprise me at all that Momentum activists in my local party supported the motion of censure in my case.
After all, I am just one of the members of the Labour Party in Parliament who has been told that they are not welcome, just because we have expressed our opinion.
Joan Ryan, my fellow Member of Parliament, received similar treatment because she was vehemently anti-Semitic.
As far as I'm concerned, the motion of censure was a criticism of me for disagreeing with what Jeremy Corbyn said.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, similar problems, ironically, concerning which even Jeremy did not have a common opinion with previous leaders.
The statement for the Labour Party's Friday session in Nottingham East said that "we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For much of the eight-year period as a member of Parliament for the Labour Party, Friday night’s GC meetings were like that.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings do not take place in this way, and the promise of a “better, gentler” political environment has long been forgotten, if ever respected.
It has become increasingly obvious that different opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged according to what is accepted by the party leadership.
Things have started to be this way since Jeremy became the leader, when I noticed that some colleagues with whom I had a common vision in terms of politics began to expect to change my way of thinking and to agree with some things that I would not have previously agreed with, including national security in the EU or national security in the EU.
Every time I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a wave of abuse on desocialization networks calling for my removal from the party, denouncing center politics, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only person facing this.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than my colleagues, because comments about my person tend to be of a political nature.
I am impressed by the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexual or racist abuse, but maintain their level of involvement in this regard.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that abuse has become a normal thing.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer accept different views within the party, and with each motion of censure or change of selection rules, the party becomes increasingly less flexible on this issue.
Many people have recommended in the last two years to put my head down, not to be so vocal, and everything "will be fine" like this.
But that's not why I got into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I was a student, motivated by the fact that the negligence that the Thatcher government demonstrated led to the collapse of my class, I wanted to fight for improved public services for those who most need them, as a local councillor or councillor.
I have never hidden my political opinions, even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can say that my views on politics and issues with which I disagree with the current leadership are unclear.
To the people who supported Friday’s motion, I can only say that, in the context of the country heading for Brexit, which will affect our households, businesses and local services, I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But the only message I want to convey is not for the Momentum group in Nottingham, but for the citizens, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to represent you and I promise you that no threat of removal from the party or superior political opportunism will stop me from making the decisions you consider to be in your interests.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr football team reaches the top of the rankings
Despite the fact that two late attempts somehow influenced the final result, there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win today's highly interactive match in Tennent's Premiership.
He is now at the top of the standings, being the only team without any defeat in the ten.
In the end, it all came down to their better defense, as well as the fact that they took more advantage of the chances that emerged, which helped the host team and thanked coach Peter Murchie.
“We’ve been tested several times in our matches so far and we continue to be undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie from Melrose said: “The merits are given to the Ayr team, they took advantage of the chances more than we did.”
Grant Anderson's 14-minute try, transformed by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr an advantage, but a yellow card received by Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who was able to join the team, he playing for the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of our goal and try to score a goal.
Climo scored a penalty for Ayr and, even in the middle of the match, managed to score, and then managed to turn an individual try, and the score was 17-5 for Ayr on break.
But Melrose started the second round very well, and Patrick Anderson's essay, transformed by Baggot, reduced the margin to five points.
The match was suspended for a few minutes due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott, who was removed from the pitch, and since the restart of the game, Ayr has been unleashed through the attempt of Stafford McDowall, transformed by Climo.
Ayr team captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again, the Melrose team made the backup player pay with an unconverted try by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a vicious pressure.
However, the host team recovered, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for placating Climo without the ball, MacPherson managed to score, giving him the advantage of the Ayr team.
Climo transformed the attempt, as he did again near the start of the match, after Kyle Rowe performed a box kick movement and sent extreme Gregor Henry deep for the host team's fifth try.
The star of the sitcom "Still Game" seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kiernan, the star of the sitcom “Still Game,” appears poised to move into the hospitality industry after learning he’s been named the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis on the BBC's beloved show, writing the script and playing alongside his long-time partner, comedy actor Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that the next series, the one with the number nine, will be the last, and it seems that Kieman is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the information in the official register, this is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the news, though a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the "restaurant development industry".
‘The sea is ours’: Bolivian island hopes court will reopen way to Pacific
Sailors patrol a naval headquarters full of cranes in La Paz.
The public buildings bear the blue flag, like the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca to Amazon are covered with the motto: “The sea is our right.
We have to get her back."
Along Bolivia, which has no outlet to the sea, the memory of a lost coast in front of Chile in a bloody conflict of resources from the 19th century is still alive – just like the desire to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably at the highest level in recent decades, as Bolivia awaits a ruling by the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the necessary momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, awaits the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ICJ’s decision on the big screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will give a ruling in favor of Bolivia’s claim and that, after decades of firm talks, Chile is forced to negotiate the granting of a sovereign exit to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia – who faces a controversial battle for next year’s re-election – also has much to gain from Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to decide in favor of Bolivia, and that too little would change if it did.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the power to grant the territory that belongs to Chile and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the ICJ decision comes just six months after the final pleas were heard indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And not only did Bolivia not succeed in the cause, but it is possible that the last four years have given it back.
"The problem of access to the sea has been diverted by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has weakened any Chilean residual benevolence, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making process was unusually fast.
Monday will bring for Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance "to end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – another of Latin America’s most beloved presidents – used the maritime issue as political support.
“Bolivia will never give up the right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to see that we have to go through the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not take place if it cannot be trusted in the United States
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, said his country would never disarm its nuclear weapons if it could not trust Washington.
Ri spoke about this on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to honour its promises made during a summit in Singapore with the leaders of its rivals.
His comments come in the context of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appearing to be on the verge of resuming diplomatic actions on the nuclear threat more than three months after his meeting in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an “unreal dream” that continued sanctions and the United States’ objection to the declaration regarding the end of the Korean War would ever make the territory of the North give way.
Washington has reluctance to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking significant disarmament measures.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there are many sceptics who do not believe that Pyongyang has serious intentions to give up the arsenal that the country considers the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris presents the latest trends in hats and will be available in stores soon
If you are looking for hats to expand your collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, you no longer need to look.
Fashion creators Valentino and Thom Browne shocked participants at Paris Fashion Week by launching a series of oversized and extravagant hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection.
The non-practical hats have taken over the Instagram platform this summer, and fashion designers have sent the eye-stealing creations to the podium.
Valentino’s piece of resistance was an extravagant beige hat with a wide, feather-like boron, in which the heads of the models sank.
Other oversized accessories included melons adorned with beads, a witch hat, and even a pineapple, but these are not designed to protect your head from the cold.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and brought more of the accessory chosen by Hannibal Lecter, and not haute couture fashion.
One of the creations appeared to be a diving equipment, having an oxygen tube and glasses, while another appeared to be a cone with melted ice cream.
And if you want to continue to adopt such a style of clothing, with oversized items of clothing, you are in luck.
The stylists are predicting a return of huge bonnets in luxury fashion stores.
Oversized hats come after the appearance of the “La Bomba” hat, the straw hat with a wide boron, seen by everyone, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The return of the non-practical hat that appeared on all social networks caused the appearance of another oversized creation on the podium, namely the straw bag for the beach, with a size as large as the model in the swimsuit that wears it.
The orange raffia bag, with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the resistance piece of Jacquemus’ spring-summer 2019 “La Riviera” collection at Paris Fashion Week
Star designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect to see oversized hats and beach bags in luxury stores next summer because the fashion designer has had such a strong impact that it will be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills, essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional exam results, which is underpinned by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community efforts.
With over 30,000 students in Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide services at the highest level to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for high school and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an educational sector that can conceive and implement a special school curriculum, we note that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable topic of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language he understands, your words will come to his mind.
If you speak to him in his own language, the words reach his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we can’t just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s competition, we note that foreign languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest promotion rates in independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained a Higher Grade A certificate.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students obtained a Higher Grade A certificate in Mandarin; also, 72% of those who study German, 69% of those who study French, and 63% of those who study Spanish obtained such a certificate.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that children and young people will certainly need in the future.
Now, foreign languages, as a matter, hold the same as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and in other fields.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission found that, for reasons employers gave for the fight to fill vacancies, 17% were attributed to a language skills shortage.
Therefore, more and more, language skills become imperative for preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities that require foreign languages, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career one chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future, having such a skill throughout life.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person before the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to carry on a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%.
Therefore, investing in foreign language learning is important for today’s children.
Having more languages, especially in countries with a developing economy, children will be more likely to find meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, each school will teach other foreign languages.
A number of schools will focus on more modern classical languages, while others will learn languages that are considered to be most important to the UK when looking ahead to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be more languages of choice within independent schools, with teaching staff who are specialized in this field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and encourage them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages continue to be vital to the future of the country, so it must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should indeed be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done (it has to be done).
John Edward is Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James make his Los Angeles Lakers debut.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how many minutes he will play remains to be determined.
“There will be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell wrote on Twitter that James will likely play limited minutes.
Following training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason program.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need games in the preseason to prepare,” he said.
Time for Trump’s West Virginia election rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five Trump rallies scheduled in the next week, which include stops in places where the electorate favors him, such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
As the confirmation vote for his running mate for the Supreme Court seat is temporarily suspended, Trump wants to bolster support for future midterm elections as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s election rally take place in West Virginia tonight and where can I watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m., East Coast time, tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s election rally in West Virginia online via the live video stream below on YouTube.
Trump is likely to discuss this week’s hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a hearing that has become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, while the Senate’s expected confirmation vote is suspended for a week for the FBI to investigate the allegations.
But the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans, who face tough elections in November, gain some ground.
Trump’s campaign said the role of these five rallies next week was “to energize volunteers and supporters, while Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majority held in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Control of Congress is so important to his program that the president will travel to as many states as possible before entering the very busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, who declined to be named.
Scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, tonight’s rally could draw supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and be featured in the Pittsburgh media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won the election by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is being run in polls.
“The fact that the president came to try to propel him into polls is not a good sign for Morrisey,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: The U.S. team gives determination and continues to fight to keep the chance for the simple tests that start on Sunday
After three clearly dominated sessions, it’s possible that Saturday’s foursome test was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The ever-oscillating pendulum of motivation is a concept invented for the world of sports, but players really believe in it, especially in competitions like this.
So where is their motivation now?
“They were leading us by six points, now the difference is only four points, so we’re relying on this drop for a bit of motivation,” Spieth said at the end of the day.
Europe still has the advantage, of course, with a four-point lead, when there are still twelve points in play.
Americans, Spieth says, feel that the game is starting to change in their favor and that there are plenty of reasons for encouragement, the most important of which is the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have played together all day and won every three out of four points.
Spieth sent the beans to the green area with lethal precision, setting an example for his colleagues.
Those festive guttural shouts became louder as the round progressed, especially when he scored a crucial point by re-equalizing the score in the fourth game, after he and Thomas had been led by two points after the first two holes.
The shot he won the match at 15 was celebrated with a similar howl, a howl that makes you think the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth says.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to leave a good impression.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s strange but adorable couple have won four out of four matches and it seems they can’t go wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only pair that didn't need any extra kicks on Saturday afternoon, but this statement is valid for Saturday morning, and for Friday afternoon, and even for the nine points on Friday morning.
This performance and the way their energy seems to flow to and from the enthusiastic public reinforces the view that they will be the most dangerous players on Sunday. No other player would be more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari if they would end up a potential victory over the Europeans when the sun goes down.
Preferably, both at the same time, at different holes.
Discussions about the glory of Europeans remain premature, for the time being.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly passed Sergio Garcia, the morning hero at the fourballs, when he teamed up with Alex Noren.
An extra shot and two doubles at the first nine holes sank the Spanish and Swedish into a pit so deep that they were not even close to getting out of it.
On Sunday, however, no one will be safe.
Samples of fourballs and foursomes are fascinating and well worth watching closely due to the interactions between pairs, given and ungiven tips, and how a strategy can change on the spot.
The Europeans have played better as a team so far and have a significant advantage on the final day, but this foursome session also showed that the U.S. team has the motivation to continue the fight, which some, especially those in the United States, doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe starts the last day of the Ryder Cup with a significant advantage after finishing the fourballs and foursomes on Saturday with a 10-6 advantage over the United States.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the offensive with two wins in front of a hesitant Tiger Woods, which has boosted their score so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, trying to regain the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the American players who made many mistakes on the morning fourball trial and won the series with a score of 3 to 1.
The U.S. opposed a more serious resistance to the foursome, where it won two matches, but was unable to reduce the deficit.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points from Sunday’s 12 singles matches to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European novice to win four points in a row, and along with Molinari, a pair named “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four of the four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly defended to defeat the discouraged Woods and American novice Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer score, 5-4.
Woods, who struggled in the two games on Saturday, had occasional glimmers of genius, but has so far lost 19 of his 29 fourballs and foursome games, seven of which were consecutive defeats.
Justin Rose, who rested during the morning fourballs session, returned with partner Henrik Stenson in the foursome test and defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2-1, positions one and three in the world.
Europe, however, did not have an unhindered journey on this pleasant and cool day in southwest Paris.
Jordan Spieth, a triple major tournament winner, and Justin Thomas became the benchmark for Americans, earning two points on Saturday.
They managed to win a 2–1 game against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-balls, then came back later and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4–3 in the four-game, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team managed to recover a four-point deficit in the singles, although, because they are the current holders of the trophy, Furyk's players only need an equal result.
However, after being in second place for two days in a row, a Sunday counterattack seems unlikely.
North Korea says there is "no chance" of unilateral disarmament as long as there is no trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that extending sanctions would deepen mistrust in the United States and that it was impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the Global Council that “significant measures to prove good faith” were implemented in North Korea last year, such as halting nuclear testing and missile testing, dismantling the nuclear test site, and committing to nuclear weapons non-proliferation.
“However, we do not see any proper response from the United States,” he said.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t trust our national security capabilities, and in such circumstances, we can’t unilaterally disarm first.”
Although Ri reiterated North Korea’s familiar objections to Washington’s opposing resistance to a “temporary” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded if it took gradual steps, his statement seemed significant because it did not directly reject the past unilateral denuclearization as it did.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a summit for the first time between a U.S. president and North Korea’s leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to make progress toward a “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump offered North Korean assurances.
North Korea sought an official end to the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington has not heeded calls to relax tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on the ‘first denuclearization’ option and increases the pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive way, even objecting to the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The impression that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an illusion that only people who don’t know us have.
But the problem is that the prolonged sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader referred to at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-in, the president of South Korea, in the last five months, adding: “If the issue of denuclearization had been negotiated with South Korea and not with the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have been imposed on it.”
Even under these conditions, Ri’s tone of speech was very different from that of last year’s speech when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target US territory with missiles from North Korea after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim “a mischievous son-in-law.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened North Korea with “total destruction” last year, praised Kim for the courage to initiate the disarmament process, but said work was just beginning and that sanctions would remain in place until North Korea is denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no planned period for this and added: “It doesn’t matter if it lasts two or three years or five months.”
China and Russia say that Pyongyang should be rewarded by the UN Security Council for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without interruption until we achieve complete, final and confirmed denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions imposed on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to block funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest visit has not yielded very good results.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, but after just a few hours, North Korea denounced the fact that he had made “gangster threats.”
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile launch pad and a nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim told him that the "appropriate measures" he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and that he wanted normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take courses on how to get enough rest
A new Harvard University course this year encourages students to sleep longer, in an attempt to combat the growing “macho” culture that makes them subject themselves to “all-night” learning sessions energized with lots of caffeine.
A scientist has discovered that students at the world’s most prestigious university often don’t even master the basic concepts of how they should take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is the one who created the course, which is believed to be the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to create the course after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on the ability to learn.
“In the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why am I being told this just now, in the last year?’
She told me that she had never been told about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, introduced for the first time this year, explains to students the essential concepts of how good sleep habits help improve academic and athletic performance, as well as overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students were seriously sleep deprived during the week.
An hour-long course can involve a number of interactive tasks.
Within one section is presented the image of a bedroom, and students can click on coffee mugs, curtains, sports pants and books to tell them what are the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deficiency, but also about the importance of a sleep program.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression, and cancer.
A campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily schedule.
“We know we can’t change students’ behavior instantly.
But we believe that they have a right to know, just as anyone has a right to know what the health effects of smoking are," Professor Czeisler added.
The culture that makes students proud to have learned all night still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students have turned sleep deprivation into a growing problem.
Enough sleep, of good quality, should be a student’s “secret weapon” for combating stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid weight gain because sleep deprivation makes the brain think that the body is hungry, which makes students feel that they are hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler create the course after attending one of his first year courses at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote a course for all students.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all post-graduate students to complete a similar degree program before enrolling in this institution where competition is fierce.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students program an alarm to know when it is time to go to bed, as well as for the waking hour, and to know what are the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disturb the circadian rhythm and cause difficulty in waking up.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal knocks down Gerrard's team
The Rangers are suffering from another case of depression on the move because Dolly Menga's stroke has condemned Steven Gerrard's unconvincing team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to get their first win on the road from a 4-1 win in February against St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team managed to manage Gerrard's second defeat of 18 games as a coach, putting the Rangers eight points behind the Premier League's Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before the break and the uninspired players from the Rangers did not seem at any point able to equalize.
The Rangers thus fell to sixth place in the standings, while Livingston climbed to third place, behind Hibernian, at a single-goal difference.
And the Rangers could face other problems, too, as the Calum Spence referee had to be treated for a head injury after an object was apparently thrown out of the visitors' team's lawn.
Gerrard traded eight players from the lot who easily won against Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, used the same 11 players from Livingstone who managed to get an equal with Hearts last week and has every reason to be proud of the way his well-trained lot suffocated his opponents during the match.
Even though the Rangers had a superior possession, Livingston used the mines they had more efficiently.
He should have scored just two minutes after the start of the game, when Menga's first pass propelled Scott Pittman to the goal defended by Allan McGregor, but the midfielder missed a very good opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' deep free kick found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, sent her to the bar.
The Rangers took control, but left the impression that they hoped for more than they trusted in their game in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos strongly believed he should have received a penalty when he collided with Steven Lawless in the fifteenth minute of the game, but referee Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's request.
The Rangers managed only two shots on the goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not bothered at all by Lassana Coulibaly's head or Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
Although Livingstone's 34th-minute goal failed to keep pace with the game, no one can deny that it was deserved, not just for the effort.
Again, the Rangers failed to prevent a deep Jacobs centering.
Scott Arfield had no reaction when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and looked after Menga, who finished with a simple kick.
Gerrard acted on the break when he replaced Ryan Kent with Coulibaly; this move almost immediately paid off, when the extreme centered on Morelos, but the impressive Kelly came out of the bushes to block him.
But Livingston continued to attract visitors in the exact same type of match he preferred, with Lithgow and Halkett intercepting centering after centering.
Holt's team could have extended their lead in the final stages, but McGregor managed to block Jacobs' shot, then Lithgow sent the corner shot with his head next to the goal.
Glenn Middleton, a reserve at the Rangers, asked for a penalty towards the end of the game, when he hit the Jacobs but again, Thomson did not agree.
Almanah: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Sunday morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago (and counting CONTINUE...), is the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the creation of the device known as the Geiger counter.
An essential device for science ever since, the Geiger counter has also become essential for pop culture, as happened in the film The Bells of San Coronado (1950), in which they played Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the role of cowboys with unlikely proclivities to science:
Man: “What’s that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you can hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals."
Evans: "Yes, you can hear a lot of bangs!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before he turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘Detect’ Harmful Cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “detect” harmful cells and destroy them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in a laboratory
They can “detect” a protein common to many cancers and then be reinjected.
A test vaccine offers promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
Ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells has been gone for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, altering them in the laboratory so that they can “detect” a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Institute of Oncology in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we are dealing with a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "determines the growth of several types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, pulmonary, and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to target cancer cells, also worked for the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West held a diatribe of support for Trump while wearing a MAGA hat after appearing on SNL.
Didn't work out too well
Kanye West was run down in the studio during Saturday Night Live after a disillusioned show in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he plans to run in the 2020 election.
After performing the third song, called Ghost Town, during which he wore a Make America Great hat, the artist unleashed himself in a speech against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
“Many times when I talk to a white person, I’m asked, ‘How can you like Trump?
Well, if I had been worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a scene featuring Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star took over Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's diatribe footage was uploaded on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to take over West with this post.
In addition, West complained to the public that he had back problems because of his hip.
“They tried to intimidate me in the back.
They said, "Don't go out wearing that hat."
I've been assaulted!
They also told me that I got very low,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see how low I’ve come?”, then said, “I’m going to get Superman’s mantle, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. Do you want the world to evolve?
Try it with love.”
His comments have drawn public outcry at least twice, and members of the SNL team appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported; a person on that team told the publication: “A full silence has been laid in the studio.”
West was invited as a last-minute replacement for soloist Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West raised many eyebrows when he performed the song I Love It dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who wrote on Twitter: “For one of the bravest spirits among us: THANK YOU FOR FRONTING THE GLOAT.”
Karen Hunter, host of a talk show, wrote on Twitter that West simply “was himself and that’s great.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothing or supporting their ‘art’) that I think embraces and expresses an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, announcing that he is now "the being officially known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name; West follows in the footsteps of Diddy, previously known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, took the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the former music legend, Prince, changed his name to a symbol and then to the "artist formerly known as Prince".
Accused of attempted murder for a stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after another man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defence lawyer is expected to appear before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Kit Harington, star of Thrones, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval violent fantasy series The Wrath of the Thrones, produced by HBO.
But the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that the presentation of these roles on the screen makes boys think they need to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he felt "something was wrong" and wondered how the issue of toxic masculinity could be handled in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is also 31, admitted that he is "very determined" to talk about the issue.
“Personally, I’m very determined to talk about it now: where did I go wrong with masculinity?” he asked.
“What have we taught men about how to be like adults, given the problem we face now?”
Kit believes that television could be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity through very masculine characters.
He continued: “What is born and what is learned?
What do young boys learn on TV and on the street, what makes them think they have to be a certain type of man?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time: how can we change this?
Because it's clear that something went wrong with the young people."
In the interview, he acknowledged that he would not play in any of the series based on The Throne Room after the series ended in the summer of next year, saying that he "finished with the battlefields and the horses".
From November, Kit will star in a new production of Sam Shepard's play True West, which features the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that the best thing that happened to him due to the series The Wrath of the Thrones is that he met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife when I did this series, so it ensured my family’s future and my life from now on,” Kit said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's girlfriend, the character Kit played in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018, on the property of Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in the number of new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of Chinese citizens suffering from HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected by the disease in China, officials say.
Approximately 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases have been sexually transmitted, unlike those in the past.
In the past, HIV has spread rapidly in some areas of China as a result of transfusions with infected blood.
But the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials say at a conference in Yunnan province.
From year to year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is considered widespread.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men will eventually end up marrying a woman.
Many of the cases of disease transmission stem from inadequate sexual protection measures in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked Republican Party senators' data, talks about "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday denounced allegations that a member of her team posted personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat has claimed that the allegations are made by analysts and “extreme right” websites.
“Minds, lies, and other mischievous lies,” Waters said in a tweet.
The information disclosed included the addresses and personal phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online Tuesday, posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior against Brett Kavanaugh, who has been nominated as a Supreme Court judge.
The leak came shortly after the three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with Waters’ office and presented information to a Waters team member, Hill reported.
“These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false, an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of the team, whose identity, personal information and security were compromised as a result of these false allegations, was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false, an absolute lie."
Waters' statements were criticized online shortly after they were made, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is furious,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that he doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they don’t have to be angry.
It doesn't have to be challenging.
They must not question the accuser’s motivation.
You have to be calm and quiet.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to that of Judge Kavanaugh, who was criticized by Democrats, who said he seemed a little too angry during Tuesday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican running against Waters in the midterm elections, also commented on the situation on Twitter.
“Important, if it’s true,” he wrote.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted “appropriate authorities and legal entities to these false allegations.
“We will make sure that the perpetrators are discovered,” she continued, “and that they will be held accountable before the law for all their destructive and dangerous actions for any of my team members.”
Johnny English Hits Again: A Moistureless Parody of Spy Movies, With Rowan Atkinson in the Lead Role
It has become a tradition to look for Brexit-related meanings in any new British film, but this does not apply to the new film in the action film parody series starring Johnny English, a series that began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English returning.
Will this baffling satire of how strange we are become the nation’s new export opportunity?
However, Johnny English, the incompetent spy with blindfolded eyes and rubber face, has been renewed for the second time his license to spoil everything. The name of the character means, first of all, that it is a general comic creation for the cinematic audience in English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the shriveled secret agent who, despite his claims to luxury and extravagance, has a bit of Clouseau, a drop of Mr. Bean and a knife tip of the kind that contributed a single note to the musical theme of Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.
The character is based on the explorer and the mysterious countryless man Atkinson once played in the Barclaycard commercials for TV, which left chaos behind him.
This last adventure of JE also has one or two nice moments.
I liked it when Johnny English approached a helicopter dressed in a medieval armor and the rotor blades slightly hit his helmet.
The gift that Atkinson has for physical comedy is highlighted, but the humor is rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially because “serious” films, such as those in the 007 series or Mission Impossible, confidently offer comic moments as an ingredient.
The humor seems to appeal more to children than to adults, and for me Johnny English’s daring adventures are not as inventive and clever as Atkinson’s silent film gags when he plays Bean.
As usual, the premise has always been that the UK has serious problems.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret web network of spies and revealed the identities of the undercover English agents, to the dismay of the service agent, a regrettable small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a pompous prime minister under siege, who is already suffering a serious crisis due to declining political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything she can with her Theresa May-like character, but the script doesn't give her a chance to shine.
Her secret intelligence advisers inform her that all active spies have been compromised, so she must activate an agent in reserve.
This is Johnny English himself, now working as a teacher in a high-class school, which also gives lessons on how to be an undercover agent. Here are some cute hookers, because English runs a spy academy in the style of School of Rock.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency session, then reunited with his former partner, Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a very enthusiastic and precious character, in which the talent of Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
So these Batman and Robin of creating trouble in the Secret Service of His Majesty are back in action, facing the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls under the spell of a billionaire tech-industry charismatic who claims he can solve Britain’s IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough embark on an odyssey of burlesque adventures: disguised in waiters, setting fire to a fashionable French restaurant, creating chaos when he sneaks aboard Volta's luxury ship, then English unleashes anarchy in sheer form when he tries to use a virtual house-to-house set of glasses.
This last sequence is very ambitious, but, no matter how cute and colorful the film, it seems like a children's television production.
A rather mediocre film.
As with the other Johnny English films, I can’t help but wonder: Can’t the British film industry really give Rowan Atkinson a role to match his talent?
Labour denies they plan for the British to work four days a week, but get paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party would have a radical plan, according to which the British would only work four days a week, but would be paid for five days.
It seems that the party wants the heads of companies to take advantage of the possible savings due to the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution by giving employees another day off.
Thus, the employees would enjoy a three-day weekend, but the salary would not have changed.
Sources say the idea would “fit in” with the party’s economic agenda, which wants to tip the balance in favor of the workers.
The shift to a four-day workweek is supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A source from the Labour Party leadership told The Sunday Times: “An announcement of a policy review is expected before the end of the year.
It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a fitting aspiration in the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the party’s overall strategy on industry.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support this idea; the four-day working week was one of the promises of the Green Party in the 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not a party policy and is not taken into account by the party."
Shadow Cabinet Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week’s Labour conference to describe his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from "faceless executives" and "profits" from utility companies.
The plans of the shadow cabinet’s chancellor also refer to the fact that the current shareholders of the water-supplying regions may not recover their shares in full, because the Labour government could collect “deductions” due to established crimes.
He also confirmed plans to appoint workers to the company’s boards of directors and to create property funds by which to transfer 10% of the equity of private sector companies to employees, who will receive annual dividends of up to around <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy reveal in '60 Minutes' whether FBI investigation of Kavanaugh would cause them to change their minds
The FBI’s investigation of the charges brought against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his candidacy as a Supreme Court judge by at least a week and raises the question of whether Republican senators could be persuaded not to support him anymore because of the FBI’s findings.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, 60 Minutes correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find information that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more willing to do that than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said that from the beginning of the hearings; I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when this happened, when the charges came up, and I asked him, “Are you guilty?”
The answer has been decided, promptly, unequivocally."
Graham’s vote, however, seems to be carved in stone.
"I'm determined about Brett Kavanaugh, so we'd need some explosive charges," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett strongly rejects the allegations,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people named by her confirmed the story.
And it happened 36 years ago.
I doubt anything will change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it managed to do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event attended by an impressive group of stars with an equally impressive mission: eliminating global poverty.
Reaching its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will draw tens of thousands of people onto the Central Park lawn, not only to follow artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B or Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event, eliminating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eliminate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the spectators had to pay for a series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls or other significant things that help the degree increase.
But how successful was the Global Citizen Festival when there are only 12 years left to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to get them to act, or is it just another case of so-called “clicktivism,” a concept that refers to people who feel they’ve accomplished something by signing an online petition or sending a message on Twitter?
According to Global Citizen, since 2011, more than 19 million “actions” have been registered from its supporters, who have promoted different goals.
The organization says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group was talking about 390 commitments and announcements caused by its actions, in which at least $10 billion has already been spent or collected.
The group estimates that the funds insured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of 4 investors and middlemen who have pledged to “help children grow to their full potential,” which has promised to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help eliminate a lot of malnutrition in the country after they receive a lot from Twitter.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition just a footnote in the history book,” Tracey Ullman, The Power of Nutrition’s ambassador, told the crowd during a live concert in April.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions were taken in the UK to improve the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced it would fund The Power of Nutrition project, which will provide nutrition interventions for 5 million women and children.
The answer to one of the most common questions on their website: “What makes you think you can eliminate extreme poverty?”
Global Citizen responded, “It’s going to be a long and difficult road, sometimes we’ll fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights or anti-apartheid movements that took place before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists who will sing at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use naval forces for a “blockade” that would make Russia’s energy exports more difficult, Interior Secretary
Washington can, “if necessary,” turn to naval forces to prevent Russian energy from reaching certain markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke argues that Russia’s engagement in Syria, particularly where it acts at the legitimate government’s invitation, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason I’m in the Middle East is that I want to mediate the sale of energy, as I do in Eastern Europe and the southern part of Europe,” he said.
And, according to the official, there are ways and methods to manage the situation.
“The United States has the capacity, through our naval forces, to ensure that maritime routes are open and, if necessary, to create a blockade so that energy does not go out on the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organization that declares itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He went on to compare the way Washington interacts with Russia and Iran, showing that the approach is virtually the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less the use and replacement of fuels,” he said, saying of Russia that he “knows one trick” because of the fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements come at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe to replace Russia, the much cheaper option for European consumers.
In this regard, representatives of the Trump administration, including President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inadequate” project of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which, according to Trump, would turn Berlin into a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin said U.S. fierce opposition to the project is fueled by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we’re looking at things the same way: energy can’t be a pressure tool and consumers should be able to choose suppliers,” Alexander Novak, Russia’s energy minister, said after a meeting with Rick Perry, the U.S. Secretary of Energy in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position drew criticism from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s main industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to intervene in EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem with a third state intervening in matters of our energy,” Dieter Kempf, president of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren ‘seriously considering’ running for president in 2020 election, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she must "think seriously" if she is to run for president after midterm elections.
During a meeting at Holyoke City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for a woman to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and that requires a strong woman,” she said.
“After November 6th, I’ll seriously think about running for president.”
Warren also had something to say about President Donald Trump during the town hall meeting, saying that he “directed the country in the wrong direction.”
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was a vocal critic of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his nominee for the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "normally we need an FBI investigation before voting."
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that Warren’s majority of voters don’t think he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of the “probable” voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent of respondents support such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick: 38% of respondents support a potential candidacy of him and 48% are against.
Other names of well-known Democrats who could run in 2020 are those of Vice President Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, the Vermont senator.
Biden said it would be officially decided by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about the post-traumatic stress syndrome that Track Palin suffers at a rally of Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enrolling in September.
On Monday evening, he was arrested and charged in a domestic violence case.
“The things my own son goes through, what he went through after he came back ... I can understand the suffering of other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress syndrome and the aftermath of the wounds our soldiers are coming back with,” Trump said.
Palin called his arrest the "elephant in the room" and said her son and other war veterans "are coming back a little different, tougher, they're coming back wondering if there's any respect for what they and their soldiers in the military and air force, as well as all the other members of the Army have done for them."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, preventing her from reporting an act of domestic violence, and possessing a drunken firearm, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia challenge a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims trying to escape gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed an amicus curiae application Friday in Washington to support a policy challenge on asylum seekers, NBC News reports.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace v. Sessions trial that the American Civil Liberties Union initiated in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons, members of a gang," abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was detained in Texas.
The state-appointed lawyer representing Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have produced a large number of asylum seekers in the US, as nations facing a widespread problem with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Appeals Council that allowed undocumented immigrants trying to escape domestic violence to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international legislation."
“Federal law states that all asylum applications must be tried on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such a limitation violates this principle,” amicus curiae wrote in the petition.
In addition, the lawyers argue in the lawsuit that policies that deny immigrants entry affect the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary workforce.”
Jeff Sessions, the U.S. attorney general, ordered immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to victims trying to escape gang abuse and violence.
“Asylum is granted to those who leave their country driven by persecution or fear because of discrimination on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a social group or because of a political opinion,” Sessions said on June 11 when announcing the policy.
The role of asylum has never been to solve all the problems people face every day in the world, not even all the serious problems.
Desperate rescue operations in Palu, where the death toll has doubled, in a race against the clock to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation has become increasingly serious.
“The situation seems very tense,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother who soothes her fever-stricken baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Ambulances bring bodies all the time.
Drinking water is not enough.”
Residents began to return to their destroyed homes and organize their flooded property, trying to save everything that could be saved.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by the 7.5 magnitude Richter earthquake, were overwhelmed by the situation.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to the spine and shoulder, rests outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients are treated outdoors due to strong and continuous replicas.
He has his eyes full of tears when he remembers how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the hotel room on the fifth floor that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to save ourselves.
I was trapped in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, then just silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope I'm safe."
US ambassador accuses China of ‘abuse’ of ‘propaganda ads’
A week after an official newspaper in China published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to distribute propaganda material.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China's paid supplement in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, after he accused China of meddling in the November 6 congressional election, an accusation China rejects.
The accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters is a new phase in a escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
Although it is normal for foreign governments to publish commercials in which they promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war, which involves waves of tariff hikes for imports.
Tariffs imposed by China in retaliation at the start of the trade war were created to hurt exporters in states such as Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, experts from China and the United States said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
In an editorial published Sunday in the Des Moines Register, Branstad wrote that China “continues this abuse by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“When it spreads propaganda by publishing an ad in the Des Moines Register, the Chinese government does not respect America’s cherished tradition of freedom of expression and a free press,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, at the newsstand on the street here in Beijing you will find few voices of dissenters and you will not see any real reflection of the divergent views that Chinese citizens have about China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media is under the control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he said.
He added that “one of the most important newspapers in China refused to publish” his article, although he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections due to Kavanaugh scandal, analysts warn
Because many of the top Republicans support and protect Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh from multiple allegations of sexual abuse, analysts have warned that there will be a backlash, especially from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions created by this scandal were extremely strong, and most Republicans who publicly discussed it intend to continue voting.
"Such reactions will not be forgotten," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute initiative to investigate the FBI would calm the angry electorate.
“Women will not forget what happened yesterday, they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive group, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "Come November!" as they demonstrated in the halls of the Senate when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to continue Kavanaugh's nomination process despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, Mic reported.
“The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very high,” Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst for the news site, said.
“People say they were already very big and that’s true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the undecided female voters in the suburbs and the young electorate, between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which he detailed allegations of sexual abuse brought to the nominee in the Supreme Court, analysts suggested that he might follow a backlash if Republicans continue the confirmation process.
“This has become a mess for Republicans,” Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote or the possibility of Kavanaugh being confirmed, it’s also about how Republicans treated this situation and how they treated it,” Guy Cecil, director of US Priorities, an electoral support group for Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be relatively divided about the part they should believe according to Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony: a little more seem to believe the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41% of respondents believe strongly or believe that Ford’s testimony is likely to have been true, while 35% said they believe strongly or that Kavanaugh’s testimony is likely to be true.
In addition, 38% said Kavanaugh lied, probably or certainly, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s initiative, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other person, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh abused her in a drunken state at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee exposed her genitals to her while attending a party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to set up a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that wants to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, Berners-Lee’s open-source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has the right to access the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is “global domination.”
“Now we have to do it,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own “personal online data archives” or PODs.
It may contain contact lists, programs, calendars, music libraries, or other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available in one browser, all at once.
What is unique about this online personal data archive is that the user has complete control over who can access this type of information.
The company calls this “personal data consolidation.”
According to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, the idea is for Inrupt to contribute adequate resources, processes and skills, so as to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a team of developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team don’t talk to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a complete change when their business models are completely overlooked at once.
"We don't ask their permission."
In a post published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "the Inrupt mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of a new Internet on Solid."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate on Internet neutrality.
Even after launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic for this next era of the Internet,” Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won the Victoria Cross in the First World War is celebrated
The only clergyman of the Anglican Church to win a Victoria Cross medal as a combatant in World War I was celebrated in his hometown after 100 years.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he had been awarded Britain’s highest military honour.
A commemorative stone was unveiled Saturday by his two grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of the grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "wonderful symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very fine mist and under the intense fire of artillery and machine guns".
Later, he hastened to get to the front line and, with "a fantastic bravery", opened the way for the soldiers, then attacked himself an artillery nest and managed to eliminate three of the detachment's weapons.
Lieutenant-Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “a thing I know I’ll never be able to equal, but it makes me feel humble.”
He, along with his brother, Dr. James Vann, also filed a crown after the parade, which was conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he "feels very honored to play a role in the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people give him."
MMA fans stayed up all night to see the Bellator 206, but received cartoons with Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine that you stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, a multi-star event, just so you couldn’t watch the main event.
The San Jose event schedule contained 13 matches, including six on the main panel, and was to be broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi was preparing to face Rory MacDonald, viewers in the UK were stunned when the broadcast was replaced with an episode of Peppa Pig.
Some were not at all satisfied, because they stayed up all night to watch the fight.
A fan on Twitter described the move to the children's cartoon as "a kind of stupid joke".
“Government regulations say this content is not appropriate for 6 a.m., so they had to change to children’s programs,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Pig Peppa, yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that in the future, they will schedule their events in such a way that they can be watched by viewers in the UK.
“When I think about the replays, I think we could probably sort it out,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on a Sunday here and we won’t be able to do that until Sunday, our time, or Monday, their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, I started getting a lot of text messages and they weren’t all friendly.
We tried to solve the situation, I thought it was a technical mess.
But it wasn't about that, it was about government regulation.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We’re going to sum up five fights instead of six, as we usually do. We’ve tried to offer fans more and we’ve exceeded the limit.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" due to sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but this motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he only realized when he got to school that “not everyone is like me.”
Invited to Lauren Laverne’s first Desert Island Discs show on Radio 4, he said he was talking about gay people’s rights to give others “hope.”
The athlete also said that when he became a parent, he cared less about the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular presenter of the traditional show, will be missing for a few months due to an illness.
Invited to the first edition presented by Laverne, Daley said that when he was a child he felt "inferior" to others because "it was not socially acceptable for me to like both boys and girls."
He said: “Until now, these feelings of inferiority and the fact that I felt different were the real things that gave me the strength and stamina to succeed.”
He wanted to prove he’s “someone,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint everyone when they finally find out about his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a renowned supporter of LGBT campaigns and has taken advantage of this year’s appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt lucky to be able to live free, untethered, and because he wanted to give others “hope” as well.
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" by falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black.
Daley was married last year to the Oscar-winning filmmaker, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference was never a problem.
"When you go through so much at such a young age" - he participated in the first Olympics when he was only 14, and his father died of cancer after three years -, he said, it's hard to find someone of the same age who has gone through the same good times and bad.
The two became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, which Daley says changed his "whole outlook."
“If I had been asked last year, I wouldn’t have been interested in anything other than winning a gold medal,” he said.
“You know what? There are more important things than gold medals at the Olympics.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and that one of the last things he wanted to know was if he had received the tickets for the 2012 London Olympics, because he wanted to be first.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You won’t be able to be first, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it wasn’t until he stopped breathing and died that I finally accepted that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“I knew that this is what I dreamed of all my life, to jump in front of spectators in my country at the Olympics, there is no better feeling,” he said.
This also inspired him in his chosen music, Proud by Heather Small, a song that encouraged him before the Olympics and still excites him.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson, out of form, was transferred to the reserve bank on Saturday, in the Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday when he plays in the forty-seventh game of the Ryder Cup, but he will have to recover to a good form so that this is not an unfortunate opportunity.
Mickelson, who plays in the biennial event for the twelfth time, another record, was passed on the reserve bench by Captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursome samples.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as was often the case for the U.S. team, the five-time major tournament winner split his day between being a cheerleader for the team and practicing his kicks, hoping he would right what he did wrong.
The 48-year-old has never had the straightest drives, not even in the best period of his career, so it is not the best choice for the narrow terrain at Le Golf National, where long rough areas often punish the wrong shots.
And if the pitch isn’t a big enough challenge, Mickelson will face Francesco Molinari, the meticulous British Open champion who has teamed up with novice Tommy Fleetwood and won all four matches of the week.
Mickelson's match could prove absolutely crucial for the Americans, led by four points at the entrance to the 12 singles matches, which must begin in force at this stage.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player’s ability, but he couldn’t have said anything else anyway.
“He fully understood the role he played today, hit me on the shoulder, hugged me and told me he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has contributed greatly to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play in two games.
I imagined more, but that’s what happened and that’s how I thought we should proceed.
He wants to play, like everyone else."
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
This could be the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which has not risen to his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brought some intangible advantages to the team.
“He’s funny, he’s sarcastic, he’s smart, he likes to joke with the players, he’s a great guy in the team locker room,” he explained.
“I think the young players are having fun with him, it was fun to see them doing that during the week.
His role is more important, it’s not just about the game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the considerable advance could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of the Europeans, knows from experience that the considerable advance held before the first day of the simple tests in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable journey.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, when the team led by captain Seve Ballesteros led the Americans by five points, but only managed to beat them by a minimum difference of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 to 131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“I remind myself that we had a considerable lead at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we barely managed to win,” said Bjorn (pictured) after watching how the 2018 team, which won 5-3, both Friday and Friday with the National and now with the Le 6 lead.
“So history shows me and my team that it’s not ready yet.
Tomorrow we have to play at full speed.
Let’s go out on the field and do everything perfectly.
The game is not ready until the points are passed on the table.
We have a goal and it is to win this trophy, it must remain the goal.
We’ve always said we need to focus on the 12 players on our team, but we also know what’s on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Delighted with the way his players handled a difficult field, Bjorn added: “I’m not in a hurry to draw any conclusions.
Tomorrow is a completely different situation.
Individual performance is important tomorrow, and this is different.
It’s great to be on the pitch with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re on your own, then you’re tested to the max, as a golfer.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, that you need to be in the best shape tomorrow.
Now they're leaving their partner behind and they have to play as well as they can."
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk, the captain of the opposing team, hopes his players will play better on the simple test than they did with their partners, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself was on both sides of such a comeback on the last day: he was on the winning team at Brookline, then on the losing team when Europe managed the "miracle at Medina".
“I remember every word,” he replied when asked how the 1999 captain, Ben Crenshaw, managed to encourage his players before the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow and we would like to start with some quick wins, like at Brookline, like at Medina.
When inertia develops in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those midfield matches.
We created our lot accordingly and ordered the players as we would like, you know, we're trying to create a little magic tomorrow."
Thomas has been tasked with leading the fight: he will face Rory McIlroy in the main game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the second half of the program.
“We chose this group of players, in that order, because I think it covers all the topics,” Bjorn said of the lot for the simple test.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
Germany’s newest frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War warships, but this will only happen this year, due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The entry into service of the Rhineland-Palatinate ship, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a military spokesman.
The ship should have been introduced to the maritime forces in 2014, but post-delivery issues have affected this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
It is assumed that they will be provided with a powerful cannon, with a range of anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles, as well as with stealth technologies, which provide a radar, infrared and reduced acoustic footprint.
Other important features will include longer maintenance periods; it should be possible for new frigates to be able to depart on two-year missions without returning to their original port.
However, the continuing delays mean that these state-of-the-art warships, which are said to increase Germany’s maritime strength, will already be obsolete before they enter service, Die Zeit notes.
The frigate wrecker F125 was discussed in the press last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the builder after delivery.
Not much information is available about the reasons for the refusal, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that would have rendered the warship useless in a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels would be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half of the crews of the older Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it turned out that the vessel was much too heavy, which reduced its performance and limited the Navy's ability to add future equipment.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as the German warships used in World War II.
In addition to the faulty mechanisms, and the price of the entire project, including that of crew training, has become a cause for concern.
It is said to have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion), from the original price of 2.2 billion euros.
The problems of the newest frigates are of particular importance given the latest warnings that Germany’s maritime power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee in Germany’s parliament, acknowledged that the Navy “began to run out of ships that could be sent on missions.”
The official said the problem has grown steadily over time, as the old vessels have been taken out of service without being replaced with new ones.
He complained that none of the frigates in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class had entered service in the Navy.
National Trust Spying on the Secret Life of Bats
New research that is being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands wants to reveal how bats use their environment to hunt their prey.
It is hoped that the findings will reveal new things about the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help future conservation activities.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will look at common dwarf bats and pygmy bats, as well as eared bats and water bats from the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed in key locations around the property to track the activity of bats throughout the season.
The NHS team and volunteers will also conduct mobile studies using manual detectors.
Specialized audio analysis of all recordings will estimate the frequency of sounds made by bats and what species emit certain sounds.
There will also be a habitat map and a report, to create a detailed picture, on a scale, of their behavior in the environment.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas in the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as lawn creation, and which is the best way to maintain forest meadows for bats and other associated species.
Populations of bats in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably in the last century.
They are endangered by the construction and development work that affects their nests, but also by habitat loss.
And wind turbines and public lighting are risks, as are fly traps and some chemical treatments for building materials, but also domestic cat attacks.
Actually, bats are not blind.
However, due to the fact that they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to accurately identify the insects and obstacles on their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, is thinking very seriously about bats.
They have ten trained experts, who conduct periodic studies, control nests, and sometimes perform rescue missions.
The organization created the very first and only bat reserve in Scotland, on the Threeve estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten species of bats are found in Scotland.
The estate’s manager, David Thompson, says this is the ideal territory for bats.
“Here at Threeve, the area is great for bats,” he says.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and a perfect habitat.
But there are many things we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us understand why they need to multiply.”
It stresses the importance of looking for bats before carrying out maintenance work at properties, because the simple unintentional destruction of a maternal nest could kill up to 400 females and chicks, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected, and killing, harassing or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests, are prohibited actions.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official at the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and we don’t know how populations evolve for many of our species.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations as lawyers prepare to sue German magazine <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Cristiano Ronaldo said the allegations against him were “fake news” and that some people “want to advertise” using his name.
His lawyers are determined to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese striker and Juventus team were accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported Friday that the footballer paid her $375,000 to not talk about the incident.
Hours after the allegations were released, in a video posted on Instagram Live for his 142 million followers, Ronaldo, 33, said they were "fake news".
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the Golden Ball winner said in front of the video camera.
“They want to advertise using my name.
It's normal.
They want to get famous using my name, but I'm used to it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over these allegations, which they called “an inadmissible report of suspicions concerning privacy,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player will seek compensation for “moral damages equivalent to an appropriate amount for the seriousness of the act, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009, in an apartment at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a club, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where he raped her anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that, after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees in front of her and told her that he is "a good boy" in the proportion of "99%", and that he was betrayed by that "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sexual relations with the accuser, but that they were consensual.
Mayorga claims that she addressed the police and that the photographs of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later accepted a settlement outside the courtroom because she was "terrified of the possibility of revenge" and was worried that "she would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman is now seeking to nullify that understanding because she continues to be traumatized by the incident.
At the time of the attack of which he was accused, Ronaldo was about to transfer from Manchester United to Real Madrid. This summer, he was transferred to the Italian giant Juventus, after a transaction worth 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'would regret forever' the loss of automakers
Britain “would regret it forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in vehicle production after Brexit, Business Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The factory in Burnaston, home to Toyota’s Auris and Avensis brands, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer at Burnaston.
Other automakers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have said they fear leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal.
BMW, for example, says that after Brexit, it will close the factory in Oxford where the Mini is produced for a month.
The main concerns are created by what manufacturers call risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “fix on time” principle: for custom-made cars, parts arrive at 37-minute intervals from UK and EU suppliers.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be problems at the border, which industrial producers say could cause delays and a parts deficit.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more of the inventory for a day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company says, so production would be halted.
Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “precisely calibrated to avoid these delays at the border.”
"We want to have the best deal, which will allow us not only to enjoy the success of the present, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers shows that we need to continue to use what has been a very successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will have to stop, but warned that increased prices could reduce the factory’s competitive capacity in the long term and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is head of the United Trade Union at the factory, said members are becoming increasingly concerned: “Experience has taught me that after they disappear, these jobs don’t come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have created a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU."
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as the fight for Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russia’s interference in the election, the links between Trump’s aid and Russia’s potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumors of Trump firing the deputy attorney general, endangering Mueller’s independence, have been circulating in Washington circles for months.
Earlier this month, The New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of suspending the president through Amendment 25 to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied this report.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and reports say he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday, which was at the time at the United Nations headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "would rather not" fire Rosenstein, but then the meeting was postponed to avoid a conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump called for a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which again delayed the vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “It hasn’t been decided yet. It can be this week or it can be postponed by a week, taking into account all the other things that are happening now in the Supreme Court.
But we’ll see, and I always like to keep the press up to date.”
Some reporters would dispute this claim: Sanders no longer had a press briefing at the White House on September 10.
Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the reduction in the number of briefings was not caused by the dislike of TV reporters, who like to give themselves in the show, although he added: "I don't deny that they like to give themselves in the show."
Then he suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
“The president is participating in more question-and-answer sessions than all previous presidents,” she said, adding without mentioning any evidence: “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
“There will be more briefings,” Sanders said, but “I think it’s much better that the press have the opportunity to address questions directly to the president of the United States, not to me.
We try to do this most of the time and you may have noticed that we have done this many times over the last few weeks, and talks with the president of the United States will replace press briefings when it is available."
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries visiting him.
Press conferences given exclusively by him are rare.
This week in New York, the president demonstrated why this is happening, having an impromptu appearance, in bizarre places, in front of gathered reporters.
A State Secretary of the Ministry of Health addresses, in a letter, EU employees from the National Health Service (NHS) in Scotland on Brexit-related concerns
The Secretary of State has written to EU employees working at the NHS branch in Scotland to express his gratitude on behalf of the country and his desire for them to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent the letter on condition that there are less than six months left until the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to bear the costs of applications for permanent resident status for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have continued, with decisions expected to be taken this fall.
But the UK government has begun to prepare more and more for a different scenario, in which there would be no agreement to leave the EU.
I know this is a very stressful time for you.
For this reason, I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues in the European Union and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and also bring benefits to the patients and communities we serve.
You can consider Scotland your home and we want you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head
Tennessee State Tigers head coach Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a blow to the head on Saturday, in the match his team lost to the Vanderbilt Commodores team, with a score of 31-27, said Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State’s head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the strike took place shortly before the break.
“He got to the ink line and he just collapsed,” Reed said.
Abercrombie was put in the oxygen mask by physical trainers and medical staff on the cough line before putting him on a tarp and transporting him off the field for a detailed assessment.
A representative from Tennessee State told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of the operation to which he was undergoing at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there are still no details on the type/range of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a student in Year 2, is in his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
On Saturday, he managed to make five placards in total before leaving the match, reaching a total of 18 placards throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher court fee when buying a property in the UK.
Foreign buyers will pay a higher court fee when buying a property in the UK, with the extra money to be used to help homeless people, according to new Conservative Party plans.
This change will neutralize Corbyn’s successful efforts to attract young people with the right to vote.
The stamp duty will be applied to non-taxpayers in the UK.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher court fee for buying a property in the UK, and the extra money will be used to help homeless people, as Theresa May is due to announce today.
The change will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract young people with the right to vote, promising more affordable homes and targeting high-income people.
The higher stamp duty will be applied to natural and legal persons who are not taxpayers in the United Kingdom, and the additional money thus obtained will be used to support the Government’s efforts to help the homeless.
The surcharge, which adds to the current stamp legal fee, including the high levels last two years for the second property and properties purchased for rental purposes, could reach a value of 3%.
The Treasury expects this change to bring an increase of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
About 13% of newly built properties in London are bought by non-residents in the UK, which leads to higher prices and puts those who want to buy their first home in difficulty.
Several prosperous areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend much of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the legal stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused major construction firms of keeping property prices high as a result of the purchase of land without using it, and called on Theresa May to drop taxes on affordable homes in order to solve Britain’s “home problem.”
Corbyn announced a number of attractive real estate reform proposals, including checks on rents and the cessation of unmotivated evacuations.
He also wants to give the councils greater powers in terms of building new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my term as Prime Minister to fulfilling the British dream of a better life for every new generation.
And that means remedying the problems that exist in the real estate market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not fair that people who do not live in the UK, as well as companies based abroad, can buy homes as easily as British residents who work hard.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become far too distant, and living in unworthy conditions is far too real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to be the manager of Scotland’s national team’
Jack Ross, manager of the Sunderland football team, said his “final goal” was to become, at one point, the manager of Scotland’s national team.
The 42-year-old Scotsman enjoys the challenge of "resurrecting" the north-eastern club, which is currently in 3rd place in the Premier League, with a three-point difference from first place.
He moved to the Light Stadium team this summer after the return of the St. Mirren football team to the first division of the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to be a member of the national football team, but as a player.
We got into national team B and that's it," Ross told Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“But I spent a lot of my childhood watching Scotland play at Hampden with my father and I always wanted to come back.
But I will only have this opportunity if I am successful as a club manager."
Ross' predecessors as managers of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former club manager Alloa Athletic has said he has no emotion about being the successor to such consecrated names and at such an important club after refusing offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“The only thing that concerns me and that could affect my success is the question ‘Can I help this team get back into the Premier League?’
There is no doubt that the structure and facilities in this club allow him to be in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not easy to get her there, but I think the only thing that would make me feel like a successful man is to contribute to the club’s return to the Premier League.”
Ross has only three years of leadership experience after serving as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and another 15 months as a member of the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover after relegating to Division C and managed to save St. Mirren from relegation, helping the team win the championship the following season.
Ross has said he feels better now than in his entire playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was a decisive moment," he said of taking over Alloa's leadership.
“I really thought I was more suited to the role of manager than the role of player.
Maybe it sounds strange, because we had a good time, we won well and we had a few successful moments.
But it's hard to be a player.
You have to do a lot of things and repeat them weekly.
I face similar situations as a manager in terms of stress and pressure, but I feel it’s the right role for me.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now that I can do that, I feel like it’s the thing that suits me the best in my entire adult life.”
You can listen to the entire interview on Sunday, 30 September, between 12:00 and 13:00 on Sportsound on Radio Scotland.
The ideal time to drink a pint of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a survey
This summer’s heatwave has led to an increase in revenue in UK pubs, but putting more pressure on restaurant chains.
According to figures, pubs and bars saw a 2.7% increase in July, while restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
Peter Martin, the CGA representative who provides business consulting services and who conducted the survey, said: “The constant heat and England’s participation in the World Cup for a longer period than expected contributed to a pattern in July, similar to the one of the previous month, when the pubs recorded up to 2 per cent.
The number of customers less than 1.8% in the restaurant industry in June decreased even more in July.
Pubs and bars that serve only drinks have recorded a much higher profit than restaurants.
And the pubs that serve food have experienced heat-related losses, but not as large as those of restaurants.
It seems that people went out into the city just to drink.
Sales of beverages at all bars and pubs rose 6.6% this month, and food fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, representative of RSM, which provides services in the hospitality industry, said: “These results continue the trend that we have observed since the end of April.
Weather conditions and the impact of large-scale sporting and social events remain among the most important factors contributing to sales associated with the OOH advertising market.
Not surprisingly, restaurants continue to suffer losses, although a 4.8% year-on-year drop in sales will add to ongoing cost pressures.
The long summer of cannula could not come at a worse time for food industry operators and only time will decide whether the more moderate temperatures recorded in August will bring better news.”
The increase in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the small number of newly launched locations.
The company that monitors sales of UK pubs, bars and restaurants, Coffer Peach Tracker, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined profit of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, which is the official industry standard.
One in five children has a secret account on a social network they hide from their parents.
According to a survey, one in five children, some as young as 11, have a secret social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in “false Insta” accounts.
The news has raised fears about posts with sexual content
20% of students said they have a “principal” account that they show to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, create an account on a social network that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in “false Insta” accounts, referring to Instagram’s photo-sharing platform.
The news has raised concerns about posts with sexual content.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “principal” and “clean” account that they show to their parents, but that they also have other private accounts.
A mother who mistakenly discovered her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account noticed the posting of a teenager demanding to be “raped.”
According to research by Digital Awareness in the UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) in independent schools, 40% of young people aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having secret accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces that parents and teachers don’t have access to.”
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘Sportsman’s Voice’ on Scotland’s Athletes’ Commission
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the post of director, without executive power, of the Scottish Athletes’ Commission, at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most decorated track and field athlete, and Ian Beattie, the president, has described the change as a great opportunity for decision-makers to take advantage of the vast experience it has gained internationally in the past year.
“Eilidh enjoys the respect of the whole community of athletes in Scotland, the UK, and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletes will have significant benefits once it is included in the commission,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am delighted to be able to represent the athletes and I hope to make a real contribution and to be able to help the way sporting activities are carried out in Scotland."
The American athlete, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, in addition to the four gold medals won at the Olympics, is now a frequent commentator on the BBC, has remained disabled after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
She wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't go.
The doctors told me that only time will tell if I will recover or to what extent.
It was a titanic job, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again, and today I do agility exercises!
Thank you for your messages of encouragement!"
A breast pump ad comparing women to cows divides public opinion in the online environment
A breast pump company has caused the division of public opinion in the online environment with an ad that compares nursing mothers with milking cows.
To mark the launch of a pump that wants to be “the world’s first silent and portable breast pump,” consumer technology company Elvie has launched an ironic ad, inspired by a music video, to showcase the freedom that the new pump offers breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay for cows on a song that includes lyrics like “Yes, I mow, but I don’t have a tail” and “if you haven’t noticed, they’re not weaning, they’re my breasts.”
“I pump, I pump, I breastfeed babies, I pump, I pump, I extract milk from girls.”
However, the ad, posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked controversy in the online environment.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has been the target of mixed reactions from those who watched it, many of whom say it exposes the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to use cows to promote this product.
Like us, they have to stay pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are stolen just a few days after birth.”

Another person commented: “It’s understandable how traumatic it is for both mother and child.
Of course, why not use them to promote a breast pump for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone else added: “An extremely inappropriate ad.”
Other people defended the ad, with one person saying it was a “hidden” ad.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping really made me feel like a cow.
The ad is a bit inappropriate, but I took it as such.
But the product is brilliant,” wrote one person.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny ad that targets mothers who use the pump (often at work or in the toilets) and who feel like ‘students’.
It’s not an ad that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the group of women reveals that they danced with discreet pumps inserted into bras.
The concept behind the campaign is that many women who use the breast pump say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly fits into a nursing bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold their children in their arms and even get out into the city while using the pump.
Ana Balarin, Partner, Consultant and Design Developer at Mother commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves such a bold and challenging launch.
Comparing nursing mothers and milk cows, we wanted to highlight what it means to use a breast pump and the challenges in this regard, presenting, in a fun and real way, the incredible feeling of freedom that the new pump will give.
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made it to the front page.
During the presentation of fashion designer Marta Jakubowski at London Fashion Week, on the podium appeared the mother of two children while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have been smuggled into a refugee camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has increased, although the number of people who have crossed the border each month has remained relatively the same, largely because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to place children with sponsors.
Usually, many sponsors are undocumented immigrants themselves and are afraid that they will endanger their stay in the country if they ask to take over children.
The risks increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors, as well as other adult family members, must register their fingerprints and that their data will be communicated to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a high-ranking official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested the sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
“About 80% of the people who are sponsors or family members of sponsors live illegally in the country, and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Which means we will continue to look for those individuals," Albence said.
To speed up the processing procedure in the children’s system, authorities have introduced new rules that require children to appear in court one month after detention, rather than 60 days as the previous standard required, according to shelter employees.
Many will plead the case through a video call, and not personally in front of an immigration judge, to apply for legal resident status.
Those who are not considered eligible will be deported immediately.
The longer children remain in custody, the more they can become restless or depressed, which can lead to violent reactions or escape attempts, according to employees of shelters and system reports issued in recent months.
The lawyers said these concerns are accentuated at a larger unit, such as Tornillo, where there is the possibility that signs indicating that a child has problems are not noticed, due to the size of the unit.
They added that transferring children to the refugee camp without giving them enough time for emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends could cause them trauma, which many of them are already suffering from.
Syria calls for U.S., French and Turkish military forces to withdraw immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also urged Syrian refugees to return home, although Syria has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who is also interim prime minister, said that foreign military forces are on Syrian territory illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "the situation will be properly managed."
"This must be withdrawn immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have been uprooted from their homes.
He added that Damascus would continue “this sacred struggle until we remove terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence from all Syrian territories.”
There are about 2,000 U.S. military troops in Syria, who are primarily training and advising Kurdish and Arab forces in Syria who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
Also in the war-torn country there are more than 1,000 French military troops.
Regarding the issue of refugees, Moualem said there were favourable conditions for their return and accused “several Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that caused refugees to keep their distance.
He added: "We have requested the support of the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate their return."
“Political influences are being brought into an issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have issued warnings that they will not support reconstruction in Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on ending the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a demilitarized zone in the Idlib region to drive out the last rebel group has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped to avoid a large-scale assault with the help of Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military action will target jihadist groups, including those on the Nusra front, which have ties to the al-Qaeda network and "will be eradicated".
Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations envoy, hopes to meet soon at a first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and prepare the ground for elections.
Moualem presented the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the committee's activities should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and issued a warning regarding interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
If we follow this logic, Trump will be re-elected in 2020, unless the impeachment proceedings or scandals end his term as president sooner, which a large portion of the liberal audience hopes will happen.
In this case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end to a presidential term of all time!”
So far, it seems that the audience is still interested in the topic.
Since 2014, first-time audiences have doubled at CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled at MSNBC to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, in prime time, Fox News is watched, on average, by 2.4 million people, compared to four years ago when it was watched by 1.7 million, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has recorded an audience record, with 3.5 million people watching it on major television shows.
“This is a topic that attracts the public, because we can’t understand it,” Neal Baer, the producer of ABC’s drama “Reserve President,” said of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol building.
Nell Scovell, a comedy writer with extensive experience in the field and the author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride through Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote with Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” Scovell said.
In chaos, entertainment is harnessed.
Of course, unlike anything else broadcast on TV, the action taken in Washington could determine the future of the Roe versus Wade case, if immigrant families can be whole and about the state of the global economy.
Changing jobs is a luxury that only the privileged public can afford.
However, you’re not just an informed citizen when you get to the sixth hour of Daniel’s “Oppression” post (“The Washington Post” and the Washington Post’s “The Daily News” by a committee of experts on how Bob Woodward uses “deep background” (confidential) sources for his book, “Fear,” about Paul’s ostrich-skin jacket worth 1 cent.
For example, I will never look at Super Mario in the same way again.
“A lot of what it does makes you feel like you’re watching a reality show and it feeds you into American football every night,” said Brent Montgomery, executive director of the media group Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the show “Axis of the Handmaid’s Tale,” about the constantly changing distribution of Trump and the twists and turns of the pro-life situation.
Don’t miss an episode because you’ll feel like you’re left behind.
When I went to visit Mike Fleiss this week at his house on the northern shore of Kauai Island, it was 27 degrees outside and it was sun, and he was sitting inside looking at MSNBC and recording from CNN.
He couldn’t get away from the TV, especially as Brett Kavanaugh was to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and decide the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember doing some out of the ordinary shows in the past, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end for Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it seems they were right.”

Overwhelming external financial resources for the tightest mid-term elections associated with the House of Representatives
As a result of a realignment of the electoral districts, which resulted in two incumbents in an electoral race for the same position, it is not at all surprising that the 17th electoral district of the state of Pennsylvania enjoys overwhelming financial resources.
Thus, the new suburb of the Pittsburg district brought Democratic Representative Conor Lamb into the race, who won, in another district, last spring's special election.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th electoral district, which overlaps significantly with the 17th.
Electoral maps were reconfigured after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were not constitutional, manipulating the boundaries of the districts in favor of Republicans.
The race in the 17th new electoral district sparked a competition in funding campaigns between major party funding bodies, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a well-known name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in special, maximum-audience elections that took place in March for Pennsylvania's 18th electoral district.
For more than a decade, the office was occupied by a Republican, and President Donald Trump won in the district by a difference of 20 points.
According to political commentators, Democrats enjoy a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador because of its agreement with China, but then gave up.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Trump had a welcoming meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and held a hotel in Panama until the partners evacuated the Trump Organization leadership team.
State Department officials have decided to call U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama as a result of “recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But they were only taken into consideration sanctions against the state of El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included reductions in financial aid and visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and the high rate of unemployment and its crimes.
As internal meetings have progressed, officials in North and Central America have postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to continue a similar meeting last year, seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants from heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, officials at the top of the administration had made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference, effectively ending any review of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to highlight the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. ambassadors returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without receiving any new messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations only if they were kept anonymous.
Their reports were corroborated by an external analyst who is a close to the administration and who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Study of History
The next thing that could happen is Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on President Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is now solid evidence made public.
It also appears that Mueller is orienting his investigation into the existence of a plot between Trump’s campaign and Russia regarding the attack on the US election.
If Congress changes, Trump will face the proper responsibility within the body, even as he prepares to stand before voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There are many possible situations and I don’t want to suggest that a “fall” of Trump is inevitable, which is also true for his counterparts in Europe.
There are choices that we all have to make on both sides of the Atlantic and that will decide the length of the investigation.
In 1938, German officers were prepared to strike a coup against Hitler only if the West opposed him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and thus missed the opportunity to avoid the years of massacre that followed.
The course of history depends on such critical moments, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing a number of such critical moments right now.
What would we do if Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a difficult position since it was reported in this newspaper that last year he suggested secretly recording the president and speculated about his incompatibility with the role of president.
Rosenstein said the Times report was incorrect.
“How will we respond if the new investigation requested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or correct or if it is confirmed in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fail, after the lesson we learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jewess who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy residence.
He survived, emigrated to America, and 60 years later, he sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the wand.
With such a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
On Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna, knowing that the victory in the match against the Austrians, after Spain's impressive draw against the Villarreal team at the beginning of the month, will put her in a strong position to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury did not allow midfielder Graham Dorrans to play this season until 2-2 with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers team can use this result to its advantage to achieve better performances.
“It was a good point for us, given that Villarreal is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We started the game thinking we would get a good result and we won a point.
Probably we could have scored in the end, but overall, I think the tie was a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half, and we scored better in the second.
On Thursday, it will be another important night for Europe.
With little luck we will get three points, but it will be a difficult match, because they had a good result in the last game played. However, having the support of the supporters, we will certainly feel even more motivated and we will have a positive result.
Last year was clearly a difficult one, given my injuries and changes at the club, but the situation is better at the moment.
The team is good and the guys really like to be here; the training also goes well.
Hopefully we will persevere, we will leave behind what happened last season and we will have good results.”
Women have insomnia because of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the survey participants clearly knew how they wanted to be cared for, few people talked to family members about it.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their husband/wife about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t initiate this conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
Here's how you can get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide the care you need if you don’t make your wishes known in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these choices could be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: and the financial advisor can be a real help in paying for these expenses.
Your financing choices for long-term care may include a standard long-term insurance policy, a mixed cash life insurance policy, to help you cover these expenses or you can insure your own well-being – as far as you have the money.
Prepare your legal documents: come to meet the problems of a legal nature.
Get a power of attorney for medical decisions, to appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care, and to ensure that professionals in the field respect your wishes if you can’t communicate them.
Also, consider making a power of attorney with respect to your financial resources.
Choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure your bills are paid, if you don’t have the capacity to do so.
Do not forget the little details: imagine that a parent of yours with an advanced age has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer the questions about his medications and allergies?
Note these details in a written plan to be prepared.
"And it's not all about the financial side. Can you tell who the doctors are dealing with it?", Martin asked.
“What are the medications?
Who will take care of your dog?
Write a plan for all these things.”
A man was shot several times with a compressed air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle while walking home after a night spent in the city.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the incident, which took place at 2:30 a.m., as “accidental shooting.”
The victim was unable to see his attacker.
The injuries do not put his life in danger, and police have called on witnesses to make statements.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died from a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications networks, disaster authorities could not obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area in the north of Palu city, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here is some key information about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow gulf on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi, with a population of about 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated 40 years of existence when it was hit by a tsunami and an earthquake.
Donggala is a regency that lies on a coast with an area of more than 300 km in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, an administrative region located at the bottom of a province, has a population of about 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fish farming and agriculture activities are the central point of the province's economy in the centre of the Sulawesi island, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Mining activities for nickel extraction are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
Also in 1996, a tsunami hit the western part of the Donggala regency, causing the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Circle of Fire, an area with intense seismic activity.
Here are some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: On December 26, a powerful earthquake off the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra Island triggered a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them from Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale struck the south of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake on the Richter scale occurred near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale struck one of the Mentawai Islands off the coast of Sumatra, triggering a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: A low-intensity earthquake occurred in the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, causing damage and panic as people remembered the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004, which killed a large number of people.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died because of the collapsed buildings.
2018: Several powerful earthquakes have occurred on the tourist island of Lombok, causing the deaths of more than 500 people, most of them on the northern side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded under the rubble.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on violent charges.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, being involved in a domestic violence complaint and opposing arrest, according to a report published Saturday by police in the state of Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to claim the alleged crimes, he took his phone.
Palin is in police custody at the Mat-Su unit awaiting trial and is being held on a $500 bail bond, according to KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he pleaded “100% innocent” when he was asked to plead, according to the network.
Palin faces three Class A felony charges, meaning he could be jailed for up to a year and fined $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B felony, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with such crimes.
In December 2017, he was accused of violence against his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to announce the alleged assault.
The case is currently on trial at the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, being involved in a complaint of a domestic violence crime and possessing a gun while he was in a state of intoxication in connection with an incident.
According to his girlfriend’s statement, he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 after her son’s violent behavior was associated with the post-traumatic stress syndrome he suffers from after being part of Iraq’s military forces.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people have died
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter scale triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and telecommunications networks are damaged and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred off the coast of the central Sulawesi province, which lies in the northeastern Indonesian capital Jakarta.
There are videos on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the shore.
Federal prosecutors want capital punishment for suspect in New York City terror attack
The New York federal prosecutor’s office wants the capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that was no longer enforced in the state for a 1953 federal crime.
It appears that Saipov, 30, used a rented Home Depot truck to carry out an attack on a bike lane on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, hitting pedestrians and cyclists on his path in October.
To justify the capital punishment, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily harm, according to the notice of intent on the request for capital punishment filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges can receive a capital sentence, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 counts of murder, including eight counts of murder in support of organized crime, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed the act as “odious, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevich Saipov caused injuries, suffering and loss to the families and friends of the following people: Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian de Pagnucco”, according to the press release.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been a decade since the last trial of a capital punishment case in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was charged with the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last capital punishment applied in a federal case in New York took place in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, two husbands executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War, two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a Uzbek citizen, showed no regrets in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he was happy with what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he felt inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the prosecutor.
According to police, he also demanded that the ISIS flag be flown in the hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges against him.
David Patton, one of the office defenders who represented Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to apply the death penalty, instead of accepting a life sentence plea with no possibility of release, will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov's defense team has previously asked the prosecutor's office not to apply capital punishment.
A Conservative Member of Parliament says Nigel Farage must be at the forefront of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised today that he would "mobilize the civilian army" during a protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former Ukip leader said politicians must "feel the pressure" from eurosceptics, following a statement by a member of parliament Theresa May who suggested he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a demonstration in Birmingham that the UK “would have come out” by now if Farage was secretary of the Brexit campaign.
But May’s challenge to the highly divided camps was accentuated by members of the Conservative Party who joined another protest against the European Union’s planned exit from the city.
The Prime Minister is trying hard to ensure that his compromise plan, the so-called Chequers plan, is carried out properly, facing attacks from those who support leaving the European Union, those who want to remain in it, as well as from the European Union.
Allies have stressed that it will continue to try to conclude an agreement with Brussels, regardless of the consequences, and will force the Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between its offer and “chaos”.
Bone said at the event of the pro-Brexit movement "Leave Means Leave" in Solihull that he wants to "give up the Chequers plan".
He suggested that Farage should be part of the team and be given the responsibility associated with the negotiations with Brussels.
“If things were being led by him, I would no longer be in the European Union,” he said.
The Conservative Member of Parliament, the Wellingborough constituency representative, added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to give up the Chequers plan.”
Referring to his opposition to the European Union, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone denied suggestions to change public opinion at the 2016 vote: “It’s not at all true that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the Union.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a member of the Conservative Party that supports Brexit, was also at the demonstration and told reporters: “I just want to say this: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the voices of the people.
“The public does not agree with the Chequers plan, the opposition will not vote for it, our party does not agree with it and neither do our activists who go out into the street and who support us, first of all, in the elections.
Quit the Chequers plan and start listening."
In a message targeting Theresa May, she added: “The prime ministers who keep their jobs are the ones who keep their promises.”
At the rally, Nigel Farage said politicians should be put in a position to “feel the pressure” if they are about to give up on the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let them do that.”
In a message to his enthusiastic thanks, he added: “I want you to help us put pressure on our political class, which is about to betray Brexit.
“We are mobilising the civilian army of the country that brought us victory in Brexit and we will not give up until we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of remaining in the European Union marched through Birmingham ahead of a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists raised banners that read “The Conservative Party is against Brexit” after the group’s launch this weekend.
Lord Adonis, a member of the Labour Party, laughed at Conservative Party members and the security issues they faced in the party's application at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who tell us that they can deploy IT systems and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for digitizing customs procedures, for free and unrestricted trade in Ireland,” he added.
“It is a prank.
“Brexit has no benefits,” he added.
Warren plans to think seriously about running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said she will seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future Saturday during a town hall meeting in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, a member of the GOP House of Representatives who was co-chair of Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could defeat Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting of eligible citizens using the format of the town hall since Trump took office as president.
One participant asked her if she was going to run for president.
Warren responded that the time has come for “women to come to Washington to solve the problems of our seriously affected government and this includes putting a woman at the head of it.”
A suspect was arrested in the case of the death that caused the death of Sims player from the LSU team
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, announced on Saturday that a suspect had been arrested in the case of the death that caused the death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at an ET news conference at 11:00 a.m.
They posted video footage of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying the man in the images.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head, causing his death,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the scene, that he was in possession of a gun, but also that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into police custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a junior player with a height of 1.98 m, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, being 10 times in the original batch in the last season and playing, on average, 17.4 minutes, with 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins world title after his team helps him win against Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the orders given by the Mercedes team will have an essential role in the race.
Being in the top position in the standings, Bottas had a good start and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to stop at the box and left Hamilton at the tail of the group, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes stopped a lap later and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton managed to advance after several schemes that forced the Ferrari driver to leave the interior free, after making a double move to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started the race in the back row of the carriage and was in seventh place near the end of the first lap, just on the day he turned 21.
Then he was in the lead for much of the race, aiming for a quick finish and trying to overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
In the end, he stopped at number 44, but was unable to step up in the last eight laps, with Raikkonen remaining in fourth place.
“It was a difficult day. Valtteri did an exceptional job all weekend and behaved like a real gentleman, letting me pass in front.
And the team did an excellent job to win against Ferrari and to achieve this double,” Hamilton said.
A Terrible Body Language
President Donald Trump on Saturday ironed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a rally on her insistence that she did not facilitate the "leakage" of Christine Blasey Ford's letter, which accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate has shown that people are “evil, immoral and lying.”
“The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and evil and immoral and lying,” he said.
“When you see they published and leaked information and then they say they didn’t.
They're not responsible.
Do you remember?
When did I ask Dianne Feinstein if she facilitated the leak of the document?
Do you remember her answer? She said: umm..poftim?
Uh... no.
I didn't do that."
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't," he added, imitating the senators.
Feinstein was sent a letter detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh by Ford in July and was "scuttled" in September, but Feinstein denied that the "leakage" occurred from her office.
“I did not hide the allegations against Ford and I am not the one who facilitated the leak of her report,” Feinstein told the commission.
“He asked me to keep it confidential and that’s exactly what I did.”
But her denial did not seem to have pleased the president, who commented during Saturday’s rally: “To be honest, it was a terrible body language.
Maybe she didn't, but it was the most horrible body language I've ever seen."
Continuing the defense of the Supreme Court candidate, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges to achieve their own ends.
“They are determined to take power in any way possible.
Notice the wickedness, the immorality, they don’t care who they hurt and who they have to destroy in order to gain power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars win 5-3 against the Giants in Belfast
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Stars of Dundee paid for Friday's loss from the Elite League, winning ahead of the Giants of Belfast in Saturday's return match with a 5-3 score in Dundee.
The Giants had a two-goal lead with Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied the score before Dwyer brought the Giants back to the opposing team.
Francois Bouchard equalised the score for Dundee before two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third Elite League defeat this season for Adam Keefe's players, who had reclaimed ground by beating the Dundee team 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the last three matches.
Dwyer's opening show kicked off in the fourth minute, i.e. 3:35, from a pass by Kendall McFaull, then David Rutherford passed decisively to Beauvillier who doubled the team's lead four minutes later.
In a match that started so dynamically, Sullivan brought the host team back into the game in the 13:10 minute, before Matt Marquardt offered Cownie the opportunity to score for an equal score in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break, when he scored his second goal at the end of the first half.
The host team regrouped and Bouchard equaled again with an impressive goal in the 27:37 minute.
Later in the second half, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen gain an advantage for Dundee for the first time in that match, securing the team's fifth-place finish in the last half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller has died after securing the take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers during an earthquake.
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is considered a hero, dying after ensuring the safe take-off of a plane with hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake shook the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There have been several powerful replicas in the area and many people are trapped under the remains of the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport control tower in Palu, which was shaking violently.
It remained in place to ensure that Batik Air’s flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the air control tower when he noticed he was about to crash.
He died later in the hospital.
The spokesman for Indonesia’s air navigation service provider said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to ABC News Australia.
I've prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning, before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are saddened by this news,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, with the national disaster management agency saying access is limited in the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"We believe that the number will increase because many victims are still under the rubble and we have not had access to many of them," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the agency's spokesman, said in a statement.
Waves up to six meters high devastated the city of Palu, with a joint funeral to be held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings victims.
It is almost impossible to find drinking water.
All the mini-markets are looted."
Jan Gelfand, director of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Red Cross in Indonesia is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It's already a tragedy, but it could get worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the national army: “Please work day and night to carry out all evacuation operations.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by the Lombok earthquake, which killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini now says one person is missing after a plane crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia
The airline that owned the plane that crashed in a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says one person is missing after it previously said all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a press release that a male passenger had disappeared since Saturday afternoon.
She also mentioned that she is trying to find the man, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for additional passenger details, such as age or nationality.
Local boats were used to retrieve the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
On Friday, authorities said seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is not yet known what caused the accident and the exact order of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane missed the runway and landed in a lagoon next to it.
Some witnesses believe that the plane crossed the end of the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane had reached a very short distance from the ground.
“It’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes also said that he and other passengers managed to cross the water, which had reached the bridge, and reach the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He also said that the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to renovate a landing gear jumped in to help, using an inflatable boat to transport people to shore before the plane sank 30 meters underwater.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents at PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but none of them included an Air Niugini aircraft.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night in which a woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the U.S. Attorney’s Office concluded its plea regarding the resumption of the trial for a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in information analysis.
He presented to the jury how he used the recordings on his mobile phone to put together the actions of 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, as well as those of his victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night she died.
Rowlett said she received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she was killed, contradicting her earlier claims, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
The moment the data revealed that his mobile phone was with Chambers when he said he was with his friend, Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford was called into the witness box and confessed that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville."
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Records on mobile phones indicate that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
“He erased it from his life,” Hale said.
According to the schedule, the defense will begin its final plea on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the jury to decide at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A trio that sings hip-hop music wants to change the negative way this kind of music is seen, with the help of songs with positive messages.
The Bristol-based band The High Breed says hip-hop has stopped broadcasting political messages and tackling social issues as it originally did.
They want to go back to the origins and make hip-hop conscious to be popular again.
A recent revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common in the UK has been observed through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another person of color?
A New York City nanny is suing a couple for firing her after she received a “racist” text message.
A New York City nanny is suing a couple for dismissal on discriminatory grounds after she accidentally received a text message from her mother complaining that she was “another person of color.”
The couple denied they were racists, saying she had sued them for “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, expressed her dissatisfaction when she learned that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was colored when she showed up on the first day of work in 2016.
“NUUUUUU! Still a person of color,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing the flaw, feeling embarrassed, Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, stating that the nanny, who is African-American, had not fulfilled his duties properly and that he had expected to receive a suitable nanny of Filipino, Post-Philippine nationality.
Maurice was paid for the day’s work and sent home with Uber.
Now, she sues the couple to be awarded compensation for her dismissal and claims the amount of $350 a day for six months, the period she was supposed to live with them and carry out her work, despite the fact that this is done without a signed contract.
“I want to show them that this is not the case,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple denies claims that they are racist, saying it was normal to fire Maurice because they feared they could no longer trust her after they insulted her.
“My wife sent him the wrong message.
He's not a racist person.
We are not racist people,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you were wrong about, even if by mistake?
The newborn baby?
Let's be serious."
Considering the trial an "extortion" action, Plasco said his wife would be born in two months and that she was in a "very difficult situation".
“Do you really want to take revenge on a person in such circumstances?
This is not the case,” added the banker.
While the trial is ongoing, public opinion has accused the couple on social media, judging them for the behavior and logic they have shown.
Editors of Paddington’s story feared that readers would not be able to identify with a talking bear, according to a new letter.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s acceptance, said the following about the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of a person who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
It's very funny now, after seeing that Paddington had a huge success."
She also said her father, who was a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a toy bear to write the children's book, would be optimistic about the rejection of her work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication was a "sweet year."
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she added that her father had a discreet pride in the success he later enjoyed.
“He was a pretty quiet man and he didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was like he had a kid who had a success: you’re proud of him, even though it’s not your success.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his creation, based on his imagination, he always used to give Paddington credit."
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was quickly transported to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“He doesn’t call often to tell me he’s very serious and doesn’t think he’s going to survive,” Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad telling me he was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's exactly what I did.
I said, "Tashi, my dear, I love you very much.
We'll be together soon.
I'll join you.
The effect of medications given by doctors to keep her heart pumping began to diminish and out of her body.
She died a short time ago and her organs were no longer functioning.
I had to sit there and wait, aware of everything that was going on.
I couldn’t scream or scream because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to control myself.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the death of his daughter, boarded the plane, along with other passengers, who did not know what he was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I kept my head down and the tears didn’t stop flowing.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I had a overwhelming feeling of sympathy for Nad.
I realized that he needed love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Two grieving women place various messages on a bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent other people from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys post various messages on a bridge in Wales, many of which are motivational and include phone numbers that people can call to get support.
Sharon Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and says his son was going to be a promising cook with a molybdenum smile.
“Everyone appreciates his smile.
They always said that his smile would change your mood.”
However, he gave up work before he died because he had reached a very unhappy time in his life.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after taking his own life.
Davis said, "I keep thinking you'll have a domino effect."
She created the messages “to convey to people that they can call someone or that they can talk to someone, even a friend.
Go outside, you need to talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, Davies' longtime friend, lost Mark, the life partner he was 15 years old, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t tell me he wasn’t feeling well or that he was depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, I noticed that he had changed his attitude.
She was in a deplorable state on Christmas Day, when the children unwrapped their gifts and didn’t even look them in the eye.”
She said his death was a huge trauma for them, but she must overcome it: “It caused immense pain within the family.
We are devastated.
But we have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as a result of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's investigation into the case
“I thought if we could get something similar to what he was asking for — a limited-time, small-scale investigation — we could have a little unity,” Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was about to “disintegrate” amid a partisan blockade.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
Their reticence is entirely due to the temporal factor.
There are only five weeks left until the November 6 election – if, as predicted, Republicans have poor results, their attempts to place the one they want to win in the country’s highest court elections will be significantly weakened.
George W. Bush continued to make calls to senators to convince them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met his wife, Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI completes the report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Kavanaugh can reach at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to make a difference in the case of equality and confirm it in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's Number of Refugees Drops Under Kim's Rule
The number of North Korean refugees in South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said about 1,127 people fled the country last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the key factors were tougher border controls between North Korea and China and higher tariffs levied by those illegally transporting people across the border.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of refugees in the North are finally granted South Korean citizenship.
Officials in Seoul say more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily-protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two sides of Korea.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants rather than refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still practically at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for a few talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed, in general terms, to collaborate for a Korean peninsula without nuclear weapons.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho accused U.S. sanctions have caused a lack of progress since then.
“If we can’t trust the United States, we won’t be able to trust our national security, and in such situations, we won’t be the first to unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as "hysterical", saying he is unable to serve on the Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of the Democratic minority in the House of Representatives, described Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to the Supreme Court as “hysterical,” and said his temperament was inappropriate for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments Saturday in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help but think that if there was a woman in this situation, she would have been declared ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied allegations that he sexually harassed Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and losing his voice due to emotions, while discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him “a grotesque and coordinated character assassination” organized by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved he can't serve in the Supreme Court because it showed he has a bias against Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements and the way he attacked the Clinton family and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi deviated from the topic when asked if she would try to suspend Kavanaugh if he would be confirmed and if Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I just want to say this: if he’s not telling the truth in front of Congress or the FBI, then it’s not right, not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court he’s in right now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, she is concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe versus Wade case because he is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh ignored the question of whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“It’s not the right time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Wow, that’s great!’” Pelosi said.
And women need to be able to handle it.
It is a justified diatribe, there are months and years of accumulated anger and can not speak without bursting into tears.
“We cry when we get angry,” Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, is it?”
She continued: “I received significant help from a woman in an executive position, who told me that she was crying when she was nervous, but that she developed a technique according to which, when she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, that she was going to say, ‘I’m going to say,’” she said.
I'm nervous."
And then it goes on.
I thought it was a brilliant thing."
Tears are allowed for the exteriorization of anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of the clearest memories of one of my first jobs, in a male-dominated office, where I started to cry because of an unspeakable heist, is that I was grabbed by the head of an older woman, a cold director to whom I always felt apprehensive, and I was always afraid of a picture.
“You never have to cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
I think you’re sad and they’ll be glad they made you feel that way.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democrat in Congress in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in the presidential election.
In 1987, when Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, Schroeder, extremely frustrated, thought he had no reason not to run for president.
“It wasn’t a very well-thought-out decision,” she says, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone referred to the situation as “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Because the campaign was at the end, she was behind the fundraising and swore she wouldn’t get into the race if she couldn’t raise $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
She learned that some of her supporters who had given the men $1,000, they were giving her only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting discounts?" she asked.
During the speech in which she announced that she would not officially launch a company, she was so affected by the emotions – as a result of gratitude for the people who supported her, the frustration caused by the system and the fact that it was so difficult to raise money and target voters in place of the delegates, but also by the loss of gender – she was so hurt by her voice.
“You’d say I have a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls about the media’s reactions to her.
“You would say one of my sponsors is Kleenex.”
I remember thinking about what they were going to write on my gravestone.
"And crying?"
How can the trade war between the United States and China be beneficial for Beijing?
The salvos that heralded the start of the trade war between the United States and China have been heartbreaking, and while there seems to be a long way to go, the fighting between the two countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued the first warning earlier this year by imposing taxes on key imports from China, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week came with new taxes affecting $200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively imposing taxes on half of all goods in China that reach the United States.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently imposing a tax of between 5 and 10% on US products worth $60 billion.
China has warned it will respond to every blow from the United States and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will take a step back in the near future.
For Washington to withdraw, China must agree to its demands, but publicly giving in to the United States would be far too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, U.S. trade war pressures could positively support China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could lead to an economic collapse in both countries would actually be more dangerous than previously expected,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher who focuses on Asia at the Center for a New American Security Group.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has lasted for more than seven years.
During his speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the conditions on the ground are more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists so that things get back to normal.
The existing conditions allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Six million people who continue to live in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he stressed that conditional assistance or aid from some countries sponsored by the insurgency would not be accepted.
European team wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup after defeating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 on Le Golf National off the outskirts of Paris, France.
The United States has now recorded their sixth consecutive win in Europe and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe came back in first place after the team led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored 14.5 points, needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who has made incredible efforts for most of the tournament, sent the ball from the initial blow into the water to the 3rd hair from hole 16, giving up the match to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari has had an incredible performance in all the replays, becoming one of the four players with a score of 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, since 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost in holes 5 and 4 to the player from the last place in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
World No. 1 player Dustin Johnson lost in holes 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter in England, probably his last Ryder Cup match.
A veteran of the Ryder Cup, who participated in eight editions, the Spanish Sergio Garcia, became the player in Europe with the most wins, recording an average of 25.5 points in his entire career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I am very happy that I was able to win the cup again.
It’s a team effort and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said, excited after the European win.
He hands the baton to his countryman, John Ram, who defeated Tiger Woods, an American golf legend, at holes 2 and 1, at the individual game on Sunday.
“I’m very proud to beat Tiger Woods. I used to watch his games when I was a kid,” Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has lost all four matches in France and now holds a 13-21-3 record at the Ryder Cup.
A strange statistic for one of the best players of all time, who won 14 important titles, being surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
Throughout the weekend, the American team put in a real effort on the golf course, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played tremendously throughout the tournament.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk said after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m proud of them, they really worked hard.
This morning, there were a few moments when I put pressure on the European team.
I've had a tough fight.
Down the hat for Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 players played very well.
We'll regroup. I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll move on.
I love these 12 boys and am proud to be their captain.
We have to give them proper respect.
They played better than us.”
