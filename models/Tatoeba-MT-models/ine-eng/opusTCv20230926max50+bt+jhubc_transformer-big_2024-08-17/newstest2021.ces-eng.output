Novak helped Trabzonspor to second place, <0xC5><0xA0>koda also hit
Defender Filip Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k helped the goal in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor to the title of vice-champion.
His team won 2–1 at Kayserispor and kept the third Besiktas behind them.
The striker Milan <0xC5><0xA0>koda gave the tenth goal for Rizespor after the January transfer from Slavia, which he saved, even though he succumbed 1:3 at Fenerbahce.
Nov<0xC3><0xA1>k confirmed the defender's excellent productivity with the seventh goal in this league year.
In the 63rd minute, Kayserispor's goaltender just fired a sharp shot and the Czech footballer fired the ball into the net from an angle.
The home team managed to settle five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor pulled the win to his side in the sixth minute of the set-up when he successfully ended the four-on-one break.
In the second half of the match against Fenerbahce, <0xC5><0xA0>koda equalized after a 1-1 draw.
Rizespor did not last long in an indecisive state, but it did not have to hate him, because thanks to the results of the opponents left behind three points above the descending zone.
The competition ends with the Sunday duel of the champion Basaksehir on the Kasimpasy court.
The well-hidden Cave at a hermit in the woods near Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor was not actually habitable
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lusatian Mountains, near Nov<0xC3><0xBD> Bor in the Czech Republic, in the forests that led the Count's Way, several sandstone rock formations are hidden.
Both natural and artificially created.
And we're going after that human hand made.
The place is called the Cave of the Deserter.
In fact, no hermit ever lived here, and the cave served as a hiding place, more precisely, a hiding place for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into a rock guard and accessible by stairs from above.
However, it is practically invisible until the last moment.
It will be revealed by narrow stairs leading to a kind of rock gallery, from where it just enters the rock.
Although the chamber seems to be a long way from human habitation, at the time of its creation it could have been on a plateau, where today there is a forest, a field.
"The fact that this object does not have a window and even a traditional place of heating clearly shows that no hermit could ever survive the winter here," explains historian Kamil Podrou<0xC5><0xBE>ek from the Faculty of Philosophy of Jan Evangelista Purkyn<0xC4><0x9B> in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem.
The single-storied building has only a stone bench at the back, apparently used for the storage of containers.
"I see it as a storage chamber for some food or products from the field," adds Kamil Podrou<0xC5><0xBE>ek.
On the walls of the cave are visible traces of tools.
Breaking the sandstone with the tip was quite simple and fast for the devotees.
It was enough to use the joints and gradually break down the sandstone.
Depending on the length of the trail after the tip and the way of cutting in general, the period of formation of the cave can be determined by the frame.
According to the historian, this is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is freely accessible and according to the disorder that appears in it, there is someone sleeping sometimes in these days.
If you approach the cave from the top of one of the forest paths and you are intrigued by the flowing stream and the nearby Count’s path, then you will definitely find the path down as well.
And by the way from the forest you may still be captured by nearby Havran<0xC3><0xAD> rocks.
<0xC5><0xBD>okej Mina<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k is in artificial sleep after a heavy fall in Germany
"Philip is now in the best hands.
The institute is set up for similar cases, and fortunately we have a part of the family in Hannover.
This greatly eases the situation and also the care of the daughter of Finja," the server Jezdci.cz quoted the statement of Mina<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k's wife Katji.
"Everyone is doing their best, Philip now needs time to recover.
It makes no sense to make any predictions.
Anyone who has ever encountered the problem of trauma to the head and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all have to be patient now and give it time,” said the 45-year-old jockey’s wife.
The injured Minar<0xC3><0xAD>k also received financial support from star Frankie Dettori, who on Saturday won the coveted King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Ascot, equalizing the legend of Lester Piggott.
Almost 70,000 euros have been raised on Gofundme to date.
The target is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100,000 (2.6 million crowns).
Videographer took the footballers Sassuola four goals, lost 0:2
Sassuola's players got the ball into the opponent's goal four times in Saturday's match in Naples, but eventually had to reconcile with a 0–2 defeat.
None of their goals were conceded by the referee after consulting the video due to the offside.
According to the Italian media, this is a record-breaking hostility of technology, so many interventions VAR has never had before for one team.
"The VAR was stricter on Sassuolo than the road radar and punished him like no other team.
The new technology is breaking records," wrote the newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport in a commentary.
"Festival of unknown goals Sassuolo.
VAR has never been so strict on a team," added Corriere dello Sport.
Napoli took the lead in the 8th minute on Saturday, but after half an hour of play, Sassuolo seemed to have settled.
Filip Djuri<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x8D>'s goal, however, was not recognized after the video decision maker's intervention due to offside.
For the same reason, Djuricic's further intervention and the hits of Francesc Caput and Domenico Berardi were not paid.
The home side, on the other hand, added another goal.
Electric vehicles set a new record.
In the Czech Republic, they recharged the most in history
"The growth was driven by both a 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of new e-car registrations," said Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Chmel<0xC3><0xAD>k, Head of Clean Technology Department at <0xC4><0x8C>EZ.
Other big players, such as PRE and E.ON, Tesla’s electric car manufacturer, as well as the supermarkets of Bill and Lidl, are also reporting their share in the market.
The operators of classic pumping stations are represented by MOL.
But she doesn't have the numbers yet.
"We started building our electromobility network only last year," said company spokesman Jana Juskov<0xC3><0xA1>.
However, the editorial office of the Journal exclusively obtained data from all 216 electric stands operated by <0xC4><0x8C>EZ.
It follows from them that the drivers took an average of 13.5 kWh from the stations.
This corresponds to the range of about a hundred kilometers of a smaller electric car.
If we skip the small pumping up to 1 kWh, the average charge takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refueling took place at a free rate.
If the motorists had already paid for the purchase, their typical expenditure was around 330 crowns.
Electric mobility is particularly important in the capital.
On the territory of Prague there are all five of the most used chargers of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which, due to its popularity, will be overshadowed by entire regional cities.
Between the regions it leads Olomouc.
On the contrary, the least interest is in remote stations at the border, for example in Bohum<0xC3><0xAD>n or in Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first half of this year alone, 1274 new e-cars were added.
In a wide-ranging poll of the Czechs on the Move, 8 percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car for their family.
However, only a third of respondents know where to look for the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
Environmental activists protested in Prague
According to the organizers, the government's current steps in the protection and healing of the Czech landscape and the solution to the climate crisis are insufficient, the speakers called on the state to take a more robust approach.
The event, called The Last Drop, was attended by representatives of large organizations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"We have here, for example, people who oppose long-term expansion in the Tur<0xC3><0xB3>w valley, there are people who oppose the mining of gravel near the Uhersk<0xC3><0xBD> Ostroh, there are people who oppose the construction of meaningless dams," said Marika Wolfov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She said that the main demands of the protesters are the creation of a plan to retain water in the landscape, a drastic change in agricultural policy and the system of subsidies to support sustainable agriculture and the fastest possible transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources.
"The government is supposed to defend the interests of the people, not a reckless and devastating business," she said.
On Malostransk<0xC3><0xBD> n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD>, a stand was placed with a petition calling on the representatives of the Czech state to focus on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the restoration of Czech soil and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "End of beetroot" or "Less coal, more boats".
From South Moravia, Jan <0xC5><0xA0>koda from the association Za voda pro lud, came to Prague to protest against the plan to mine gravel in Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"It threatens the drinking water supply for 140,000 people," he said.
He added that the wells represent the fifth most efficient source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
According to him, the planned mining of gravel is located only about 500 meters from the wells and according to estimates it is certain that the quality of the water will be endangered.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> came from the village of Vale<0xC4><0x8D> in Karlovarsk<0xC3><0xBD> Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Vesel<0xC3><0xBD> for so-called agroecological farmers.
He pointed out the pitfalls of small farms that do not marry for income and profit and supply residents directly on the spot.
“Small agroecological farms are able to feed the entire population in a completely normal way, and they will not do such a destruction on the form of the countryside and the environment,” he said.
Three people died when a plane crashed into a house in Germany.
Three people were killed and two others were injured when an ultralight plane crashed into a apartment building in western Germany today.
Local rescue teams said two crew members and a resident of the house were among the dead.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The attic apartment, which was one of the five apartment units in the house, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters have already managed to get the flames under control.
A spokesman for local fire chief Robert Meyboom said both crew members on the plane had died.
According to police, the third victim is a woman who lived in the house.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ) newspaper, referring to the mayor of Wesel, wrote that it was the mother of a lone survivor, whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from the apartment with minor injuries.
In the vicinity of the accident, an emergency parachute was found, which apparently served as a brake on landing.
Police say he came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two people on the plane.
The aircraft took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post, citing eyewitnesses, said the plane collided with a hot air balloon before crashing.
However, this information has not yet been confirmed.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, wrote that the plane crashed into the air before impact on the ground.
On Saturday, the Czech savings bank wrongly charged some card payments twice.
The error has already been removed
On Saturday afternoon, <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna wrongly billed some card payments to its clients twice.
According to Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Krop<0xC3><0xAD>k, a spokesman for the bank, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
The savings bank has already removed the error and returned the money to the clients.
Problems with the double billing of card payments were recorded by the savings bank on Saturday afternoon.
“Yesterday (Saturday) night we did an update to the system and immediately returned all these double payments to clients.
At the moment, everything works without problems," Krop<0xC3><0xAD>k said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice, the bank’s spokesman does not know, according to his estimate, was lower than thousands of transactions.
The cause of the problem is being investigated sparingly.
"It could have been a combination of several factors," Krop<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
At the end of March, there were 4.6 million.
The savings bank is owned by Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the Central and Eastern European banking market.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch will present a system of three emergency levels against the coronavirus on Monday
"There will gradually be, according to the strength of the community spread at the level of the regions.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch told <0xC4><0x8C>T.
It will be a so-called traffic light, individual regions will be marked in green, orange or red according to the risk of the occurrence of coronavirus.
The Minister added that the inclusion of individual regions will still be discussed with epidemiologists.
He admitted that only the Moravian-Silesian region would currently have an orange color, and Prague would be close to it.
The map will also include individual measures for regional hygiene stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to address this at the level of the regions, because the situation in them is not uniform," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said.
Vodn<0xC3><0xAD>k and Karol<0xC3><0xAD>nka
When the waterman Jonah and the miller's daughter Karol<0xC3><0xAD>nka look at each other, it is not at all simple.
In love with Jonah, his father, the merry waterman Hastrbuch, defends her, but Karol<0xC3><0xAD>nka has no recollection that her dear Jonah is not a man.
There is a young Libor who will do everything to protect the whole village, and especially Karol<0xC3><0xAD>nka, from that water-poison.
What if he's intrigued and lies?
Especially if she can get Karol<0xC3><0xAD>nka to reject Jonah and give preference to him, the brave Libor.
Soon it will be clear to all in the village who can drown the midnight Konvi<0xC4><0x8D>ka, spoiled flour, fire mill and other lotteries.
The angry villagers set out to hunt the waterman, and an irreconcilable watering curse will fall on Jonah’s head.
And now Konvi<0xC4><0x8D>ka's soul, Karol<0xC3><0xAD>nka!
How to soften the old Hastrbuch, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and free him from the curse?
The story was filmed in September 2010 in the Czech Republic and abroad near the Brzin pond, in Obdenice in Sedl<0xC4><0x8D>ansk and in the beautiful environment of the historical mill in Hoslovice.
Mostecky Autodrom launches a new e-shop

It will also buy vouchers for free and test rides by car or motorcycle on a large race track, which was previously only possible in person at a racetrack worker in the starting tower.
“We have started to improve the e-shop so that it is user-friendly, and at the same time we have expanded the portfolio of products and services that can be purchased through it.
At the same time, we have prepared a bonus for our customers in the form of a discount of 1,000 CZK for all safe driving courses from our offer.
The discount coupon can be found at www.autodrom-most.cz," explained Jana Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, Commercial and Marketing Director of AUTODROM MOST.
According to her, the website of the e-shop is now transparent, the customer easily orients himself in it.

Most cases are mild and only 3% of those infected need to go to the hospital.
Either the milder form of coronavirus is spreading in the Czech Republic, or the summer dose of the sun has significantly improved our immunity.
The infectious departments of hospitals are half-empty, although the numbers of infected are growing.
"The situation today and in April is completely different and this is mainly due to the number of hospitalized," confirms Minister of Health Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch.
It is worth recalling that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic broke out in our country, everyone was wearing a robe, the army was collecting, the republic was closed, and the Czechs had used up the disinfection for a year in advance.
Ten people died every day.
Now, the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with COVID-19, a maximum of two people die.
Karvinsko still has the highest number of infected people, and Jihlava already has similar numbers due to the outbreak in the local Alzheimer's Center, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another home for seniors was closed to hygiene in <0xC4><0x8C>erno<0xC5><0xBE>ice on Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lovéhradeck.
The disease was confirmed by tests on one of the nurses.
"We are tracking, we have restricted movement, we have all sanitary measures," says Martin Sch<0xC3><0xA1>n<0xC4><0x9B>l, director of the retirement home.
According to him, none of the clients of the home does not yet have symptoms of the disease.
Regular tests will begin to be carried out tomorrow and then decide on further measures.
Hospitals are also responding to an increased number of infections.
The Institute of Oncology in Brno today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance, which will detect whether people have a rouge installed at the entrance.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists, who have recorded twenty-five cases of coronavirus - most of them are foreign employees of the Prachata company.
A total of 131 cases were reported on Saturday - half of Friday's number - but less is being tested over the weekend.
A champion's debut!
Van den Bergh dopsal fairy tale, Anderson smetl
The great surprise of the tournament on behalf of Dimitri van den Bergh showed excellent performance even in the match against the player who won the second most prestigious company within the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was balanced on both sides, the break came as a condition of 8:7 for the Belgian striker.
Van den Bergh took the break with a 13-barret leg and has been on top ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his game and the much more experienced "Flying Cattle" was just hard to get to the doubles.
The way in which the "Dream Creator" had him in his hand is also evidenced by the fact that the tossed Anderson played his first maximum until the 24th leg.
In addition, a young Belgian managed a great high checkout.
The last time he lost was in the eleventh leg, but in an unfavourable state he "catched a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the game, Anderson was very frustrated.
Rather, he threw the darts, and his rival, who was walking behind the triumph, acted in a completely sovereign manner.
Van den Bergh changed the first of the three match darts and got his name - he wrote his big dream.
Winning a trophy named after Phil Taylor is even more valuable to the Belgian darts player than his first major win.
Still, the last player to beat van den Bergha is Karel Sedl<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
In Nantes, accused of the fire of the cathedral, the man confessed
St. Peter and Paul’s Cathedral in the heart of Nantes began to burn last Saturday and the fire seriously damaged the original stained-glass windows from the 16th century and destroyed the organs.
Investigators investigated the suspected arson because the fire was proceeding through the temple from three different locations.
At the same time, the police did not find any signs at the entrances that someone would get into the cathedral by force.
The accused is a volunteer at the local diocese, a thirty-nine-year-old Rwandan refugee.
The police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him, without initiating a criminal prosecution.
Now the prosecutor's office has informed that based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faces charges of arson.
If found guilty, he faces up to ten years in prison and a high fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets the act and decided to cooperate fully with the investigator, Le Monde wrote.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch: On Monday we will present "semaphor" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to play the role of a pandemic plan, due to the absence of which the government and the Ministry of Health face criticism.
"There will be degrees according to the strength of community outreach," the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a medium, orange degree.
The system is designed as regional, because the situation in individual regions is significantly different, he added.
On the system, the Ministry cooperated with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (<0xC3><0x9A>ZIS).
According to the minister, specific measures will be imposed at individual levels, whether it is the obligation to wear a robe or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
The Minister of the Interior Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) called for the creation of an epidemiological plan on Prima Party TV, according to which people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has increased in recent days, although the number of hospitalized remains low.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch commented on this by saying that there is no point in talking about declaring a state of emergency or re-invoking the crisis staff.
In view of the increasing number of people infected since Saturday across the Czech Republic, the government has once again introduced the obligation to wear a robe at internal events for more than 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it is 1000 people.
The government’s move, which until recently had not been clear about what measures would be taken and when they would be implemented or announced, was met with criticism.
"I think that in a situation that is quite tense, the main actors should create a sense of certainty on the contrary and level the confusion on the contrary," Senator Marek Hil<0xC5><0xA1>er said in Questions.
The measures may already vary by region, for example in Prague from Sunday the obligation to wear a headscarf also applies in non-residential medical facilities, i.e. for example in pharmacies or waiting rooms at the doctor’s office.
The obligation to wear a headscarf when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies has also been introduced in the Liberec and <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> regions since Friday.
In the Highlands of Jihlava, it is necessary to wear a robe in internal public spaces, in public hospitals and in medical facilities from July 14.
On the contrary, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, anti-epidemic measures were relaxed, as well as in the Central Bohemian Region in Kutnohorsk.
At the beginning of June, the Czech government also approved the so-called traffic light for Europe, which distinguishes the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and accordingly regulates the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
In low- and medium-risk countries, authorities do not require Czech citizens to undergo a negative test for coronavirus or quarantine it instead.
They are mandatory upon the return of Czechs from high-risk countries.
At the moment, all EU Member States are in the low-risk category.
Technoparty in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovska continues.
Plays at a third capacity, should finish at noon
Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota (Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovska) Technoparty at Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovska continues on Sunday evening.
It still plays a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to the evening estimates of the police, there are about 500 people left here after 20:00, the original rough estimates talked about three hundred, the morning of which was 900, said police spokesman Lucie Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Originally, techno parties were supposed to end on Sunday at noon, at which time some of the music systems were actually shut down.
"Some have already left and others are preparing to leave.
The music production is still going on.
We expect that there will be a gradual disconnection and dismantling of music systems," Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
“Police officers are still consistently checking on departing visitors in order to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or addictive substances.
Drivers have the opportunity to undergo a preventive breath test before departure," she added.
Dozens of police officers are supervising the action, there are foreign police, transport and law enforcement officers on site, and there are also dog guides with service dogs on standby.
"During today's day, the police checked 470 people moving at the scene of the event and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to breath tests, six of whom sat behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol," Nov<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
A total of 95 police officers tested for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances, one of which was positive.
The police have also investigated 14 traffic violations.
At the request of the participants of the technoparty, the police conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event on Saturday morning.
If the number of participants were not reduced, the police would intervene.
This was stated by Minister of the Interior Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) on Prima Partie TV.
However, the number of participants fell below 1,000, so the police assessed that the intervention was not necessary, nor was it requested by the sanitary station or the Ministry of Health.
Czech Television (<0xC4><0x8C>T) said on Sunday that the techno parties had spread to the surrounding land, whose owners disagreed with the use of the techno parties.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation for the damage.
Fans of techna on the meadow at Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kova Lhota arrived on Friday evening.
The police originally guarded the meadow in Bla<0xC5><0xBE>i in Bene<0xC5><0xA1>ovsk on Friday, where the techno parties took place last year.
Bla<0xC5><0xBE>im is located about 30 kilometers from Hlav<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> Lhota, where the technicians actually went.
According to Novak, no one came to Bla<0xC5><0xBE>i.
Snake bite: The girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year was recorded in <0xC5><0xBD>eleznorudsk.
The snake bit the girl in the leg there, the year 2010, which the parents themselves brought to the rescue service base there," said Maria Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, Regional Spokesperson of the Health Rescue Service, adding that the child was then taken to the hospital in Klatovy.
Snakes are the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic and it is on <0xC5><0xA0>umava that these animals occur in higher numbers, so it is good to be careful when walking.
However, there is no danger from these animals.
The chance that a snake will bite you is not too high, in normal contact it is afraid of itself.
And if she has room for it, she likes to crawl away for a loud sigh.
They will only attack if they feel very threatened – for example, if you accidentally step on them.
Even its bite is not a tragedy, its venom is very effective against small mammals, but it will not kill people.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism, or suffers from an allergy.
Therefore, the risk of danger is mainly among children, seniors and allergy sufferers.
"A person often feels vomiting, sweating, fever, thirst, abdominal pain and diarrhea after a bite, in weakened individuals and especially allergy sufferers, anaphylactic shock can occur," Miriam Gredov<0xC3><0xA1> from the Klatovsk<0xC3><0xA1> hospital told the daily.
The man threatened to throw the baby out of the window.
After the policeman lit the wine and threw the dishes
After 11 p.m., an intervention unit broke into the apartment and detained the men.
The babies were immediately taken to medical care, regional police spokesman Markéta Janovsk<0xC3><0xA1> said in a press release.
The man did not want to cooperate with the police, after the police negotiator threw dishes, knives or poured wine from the window.
He reinforced his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with the child in his arms.
He even climbed up to the window sill where he was crowing.
Police are investigating the man.
He doesn't want to publish any more information yet.
Stosurov<0xC3><0xA1> will give preference to his daughter before the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not be affected by the coronavirus-affected season this year.
The 46-year-old U.S. Open champion, who became a mother in June, but does not want to end her career yet.
He plans to return to the courts next year and believes that thanks to his family and his daughter, he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Stosur announced on social media two weeks ago that her partner Liz Astling had given birth to her daughter Genevieve in mid-June.
“I’m going to stay home, spend time with my family, be with all the little milestones that our Evie will be going through in the next six months and just enjoy it,” the former world number-one doubles star said.
The WTA Tour will resume the interrupted season on 3 August with an antuk tournament in Palermo.
Sapa Market: Razi reveals meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
"One of the vehicles entering the site transported 1,320 pieces of quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition, under inappropriate conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in the slaughterhouse," the State Veterinary Administration said.
When checking the stand with live fish, it was then found that the seller does not have proof of origin of the goods and is not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered a problem from a veterinary point of view in the long term.
For example, in the autumn of last year, veterinarians discovered an illegal food store, there was almost half a ton of unlabeled food without proof of origin.
For most, the date of consumption could not be ascertained, part of the products had a past shelf life and was spoiled.
In the case of five kilograms of sepia, the durability date was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers detained 80 kilograms of undocumented food, including dried fish, olives or frozen ducks, some of which were moldy.
Putin phoned Zelensky ahead of ceasefire in Donbas, Kremlin criticises planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by telephone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky about the situation in Donbas, where he is to start paying for a new truce from midnight.
According to the Kremlin statement, Putin, among other things, criticized the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
On Wednesday evening, the negotiators of Ukraine and Russia agreed on a new ceasefire with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The truce is to begin after midnight on Monday night, be "complete and general" and pave the way for compliance with other provisions of the peace accords.
In an interview with Zelensky, Putin said that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections contradicts the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects of settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian parliament last week decided that the upcoming local elections would not take place in the territory controlled by pro-Russian insurgents.
The Minsk agreement assumes that Kiev will regain control of the borders of the Ukrainian lands occupied by the separatists with Russia after granting these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections there.
According to Unian, the Zelensky office said that the two statesmen agreed on the benefits of the upcoming ceasefire in Donbas and on the need to take further measures to support peace in the region, such as the demining of the fighting areas or the withdrawal of part of the troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, on the occupied Crimean peninsula and in Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped to stop the fighting, but people continue to die on both sides of the front in occasional gunfights and artillery attacks.
The conflict in Donbas has claimed more than 14,000 lives since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky has made the end of the war in Donbas a priority, but a more fundamental breakthrough in the negotiations has not yet taken place.
The unexpected master in the decibels is Rykl, seven fights dominated by Novotn<0xC3><0xA1>
The defender of the last two titles Dole<0xC5><0xBE>al did not finish the Saturday program four hundred, Kopeck<0xC3><0xBD> on Sunday did not jump the base in the bar.
Deciboji was long ruled by the Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karas, but after the disc resigned.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor MCR so far, this time he was the only ten-year-old who got over the seven-thousand mark.
Another medal went to Vilém Str<0xC3><0xA1>sk<0xC3><0xBD> and Petr Urb<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
Rykl after the competition recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcelet and Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> S<0xC3><0xBD>kora.
"It's a shame there weren't guys here and he didn't start Kope because it would have made the results look completely different.
But the title tastes very good, I especially appreciate the fact that I gave myself a persona about 30 centimeters away.
Then I was still pleased with the stick and the disc disappointed me the most, I was below average," he admitted on the union's Facebook page.
On the first day of the seven-fight, Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Cachov<0xC3><0xA1> won by more than a hundred points, even though her ankle was injured on the spur foot.
In the remote sector, however, she recorded only 570 cm, did not exceed 40 meters with a spear and did not advance to the final eight.
Novotn<0xC3><0xA1> scored 5878 points and won by 241 points against Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
It was a long distance, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I really wish it was around 630.
“Yesterday I started to pull the calf, but I’m very happy that I didn’t feel it at all and that it didn’t limit me at all,” Novotn<0xC3><0xA1> said on her Facebook page.
Bio LPG arrived in the Czech Republic, promises ecological operation
Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is especially popular for its significantly lower price compared to gasoline or oil, given a significantly lower consumption tax, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre.
Just like gasoline and oil, it also has its environmentally friendly variant - "bio LPG".
However, it is quite new - it first appeared on the European market yesterday and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to the press report of the Czech LPG Association.
"In these days, we have received the first fifteen tons of bio-LPG, which will be distributed to our petrol stations in a mixture with classic fossil LPG," says the association Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Karl<0xC3><0xAD>k from Primagas.
Bio LPG, however, cannot be taken as bioethanol or biodiesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic oil LPG, which many motorists are now refueling in their cars.
Therefore, it is also possible to mix both versions at any time.
"The only difference compared to the classic LPG is the way of production," says Bio LPG Chairman Ivan Indr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
This is also one of the great advantages of bio-LPG compared to other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and the distribution infrastructure is also quite good, e.g. compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food residues and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced specifically, e.g. from cellulose biomass, i.e. from wood waste.
On the other hand, classical oil LPG is partly produced as a by-product in oil refining, partly by separation in natural gas production.
As a result, depending on the production technology and the source, the operation of the car on bio-LPG is 40-70% more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint than the operation on oil-LPG and up to 90% compared to oil.
But it is not CO2 emissions from car exhaust, but the ecology of fuel production, that is, the so-called "well-to-tank" part (in Czech "from source to tank").
One of the largest producers of bio-LPG currently includes petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Action Plan on Clean Mobility (NAP <0xC4><0x8C>M), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production in its Lithuanian refinery.
According to estimates of the association in the Czech Republic, about 170 thousand vehicles drive on LPG; the Ministry of Environment reports a slightly higher number in the NAP <0xC4><0x8C>M, about 200 thousand.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6 thousand conversions of cars to LPG were carried out last year alone.
It is possible to refuel LPG in the Czech Republic at about 950 stations of different operators.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch reviewed the number of infected, the number fell by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for ANO) ordered the Ministry to review the numbers infected with the coronavirus.
The new statistics were published by the Ministry of Health on its website on Sunday.
The number on Sunday afternoon fell from Saturday's 5254 to 3479 cases, which is 1,775 fewer infected.
There are currently 3,422 patients in the Czech Republic.
"Behind the jump in the number of cured is a revision of data, which recently failed to update hygiene," said Jaroslav Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek, head of health statistics.
As of Sunday afternoon, 15,212 people in the Czech Republic had been infected with the coronavirus, 11,419 recovered and 371 of the Covid-19 diseases unfortunately succumbed.
Mobile election units or correspondence election.
Politologist and sociologist searched for variants for the time of the pandemic
According to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD), the law needs to be changed in order for people in quarantine due to the coronavirus to be able to vote in the October regional and Senate elections.
Parliament could discuss it in August or September under an accelerated regime.
He made it to the Prima Television Party on Sunday.
On Tuesday, he wants to discuss possible solutions at the ministry with representatives of parliamentary parties.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean a change in the electoral law," Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek said.
The Senate on Wednesday called on the government to find a solution within the current legal rules.
However, the minister said that the provisions of the law will need to be amended, according to which people in quarantine due to the state of health can not vote.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop, on the OVM programme, said that the possibility of a correspondence election has been postponed since 2004.
Even the current draft law, which is in the House, then counts on its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
Prokop also considers the concerns of YES or <0xC4><0x8C>SSD (because, according to experience from abroad, it would rather record other types of parties) from the correspondence choice to be overestimated.
Personally, he is against the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant possibility of abuse.
Michal Kl<0xC3><0xAD>ma said that now it is necessary to invent ad hoc mechanisms (elections) that could be carried out already this year and with the least possible health risk.
He believes that the main thing is to be prepared for the year 2021, when parliamentary elections are to be held in the Czech Republic.
Correspondence choice (be it abroad or also in the Czech Republic) is considered one of the functional methods.
They also see the already mentioned electoral units or, for example, the possibility of proxy voting within the family.
He added that there is an opportunity to learn how similar situations - elections in the time of coronavirus - were addressed in Croatia, Poland or France.
Due to the spread of the coronavirus, various types of elections in 67 countries have already been postponed this year.
Protests in Bukhara: Pig ears were thrown at the government building
Participants in the demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyk Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
These were another of a series of protests against the "Mafia style of government" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide blockade on Wednesday, the DPA said.
Today's protest, which took place already on the 18th day in a row, had a weaker participation than the previous one, according to Radio Svobodn<0xC3><0xA1> Evropa/Radio Svoboda.
By 20:00, about 300 people had gathered, some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators in front of the government building played a theatre scene in which they symbolically locked Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in a prison cell in connection with the arrest of two advisers to President Rumen Radev, who is a strong political opponent of the prime minister.
Resignation of both is one of the basic demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the abolition of the announced health care reform and the end of corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
The organizer of the protests, Nikolai Had<0xC5><0xBE>igenov, said in a public radio broadcast that on Wednesday there is going to be a "peak of escalation" in the form of "a nationwide demonstration in Sofia and blockades throughout the country".
He reiterated the demand for the resignation of Borissov and his government, as well as for early elections.
The right ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has previously said he does not intend to resign.
It justified, among other things, the need to carry out Bulgaria's COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
On Friday, however, he replaced five members of his government team, even though his resignation did not calm the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov’s government stopped voting in parliament on confidence in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovi<0xC4><0x8D> no longer wants matches without spectators
Football coach Boloni Sini<0xC5><0xA1>a Mihajlovi<0xC4><0x8D> already has enough matches of the Italian league without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that from the new season, fans will return to the stadiums.
“What we’re doing right now is not football.
I'm already full of match teeth with no spectators.
It's sexless football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
These games are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I don't think I'm the only one who thinks that," Mihajlovic said ahead of today's match against Lecce.
After the coronavirus break, Serie A matches follow in a quick succession, and although they are played until the evening, their actors are exposed to heat.
"We play every three days in a terrible heat.
Under these conditions, we don’t even know how the teams are doing.
Let's get this season over with.
These measures had to be taken in order to win the competition, but I hope that from September fans will be back," said the coach, who also led Fiorentina or AC Milan in the past.
For Mihajlovi<0xC4><0x8D>, this season is unusual also because he was missing for four months on the bench for the treatment of leukemia.
"Despite my illness, the interruption of the league and everything else, our team has managed to move up a level.
We want to continue to grow and to do that we need players to be mentally stronger,” he said.
We have become the target of a cyberattack by foreign states, says Iran
Since the end of June, a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear installations, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and enterprises have been reported to have been set on fire and exploded.
Some Iranian officials said the fire, which broke out this month in the underground nuclear operation in Natanz, could have caused cyber sabotage.
The cause of many other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Musavi told Iranian media that the Islamic Republic’s infrastructure is facing “thousands of cyber attacks” on a daily basis.
He added that this is not a new phenomenon and that most of them will be able to bounce back.
In recent months, according to Musavi, several broader cyber-attacks have been recorded, behind which, according to the analysis, “certain governments and groups” have been behind them.
However, he did not share details of possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Musavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are frequent in the summer.
An article by Iran’s state-run IRNA agency this month argued that Iran’s enemies, such as Israel and the US, could be behind recent incidents.
None of these countries, however, were directly accused of specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States cut diplomatic ties shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the U.S. embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-term strained relations between the two countries intensified in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that have a severe impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the U.S. military killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
On January 8, Iran fired a large number of missiles at bases in Iraq, where the Americans are active.
The U.S. has admitted that dozens of U.S. soldiers have been wounded.
Israel sees Iran as its main enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is the main opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
According to the Israeli Prime Minister, Iran is trying to develop an atomic bomb, which Iran denies.
The TPCA has extended the production stop, now until May 25.
The Cologne-based Toyota Peugeot Citro<0xC3><0xAB>n Automobile (TPCA) has renewed its production shutdown due to the coronavirus.
The production lines are expected to restart on Monday, May 25 in the morning.
Dozens of hygiene measures will accompany the rush, said Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Paroubek, a spokesman for the automaker.
Production has been stalled due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
The company originally planned to renew it on Monday, May 18.
According to Paroubka, the reason for the extension of the break are closed borders and closed dealerships, so cars have no one to sell.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100 percent from the start, i.e. on two shifts.
The coronavirus has affected key markets of the company, such as Italy, the UK or Spain.
Mayor Michael Ka<0xC5><0xA1>par (Change for Cologne) said that the TPCA’s production stoppage is not signed for life in the city.
"From the beginning, it was known, the city was empty.
But the streets are gradually filling up, especially now since Monday, when it's been a lot of fun.
So the city is full," Kaspar said.
According to him, there are no complications with the foreign workers who remained in the hostels.
"In those two months we didn't have to solve almost any problem," Ka<0xC5><0xA1>par said.
For example, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Auto, which also stopped production due to the coronavirus crisis, renewed it on Monday 27 April at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants operate at 100 percent capacity.
The restoration of production in <0xC5><0xA0>koda was accompanied by more than 80 hygiene measures.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, the third night shift took place in Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time after the restoration of production.
About 2,500 people currently work at TPCA and the company represents one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and at the same time an employer in Cologne.
Cancer kills bride shortly after wedding: Leaves a message to family
For more than two years, she had battled with the insidious cancer of Gemma Sisson, and when it seemed that she had defeated the cancer, the disease came back.
A thirty-nine-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding eventually ended up in a hospice bed, where she still had enough to take her love of life.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to the disease.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for those closest to her.
Gemma Sisson, originally from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
She and her friend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for more than 16 years, traveled around the world for competitions.
A 30-year-old woman has been exercising and living healthy, yet she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma has started an exhausting treatment, radiotherapy, in the hope that she will recover.
After months of treatment, it really seemed that Gemma managed to win over the cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned and this time attacked the spine.
According to the Daily Mirror, the bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a ten-hour spine surgery and then began a drastic treatment again.
But everything was in vain.
Earlier this year, on her thirty-ninth birthday, doctors told her she had a few months to live.
In April, a handsome blonde finally decided to enter a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited every moment by her family, who even arranged for her wedding to her lover Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant for their two-month anniversary.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post Gema wrote for her family appeared on her social media account.
"If this was published, it means that I have finally died after weeks of fighting for too long.
Although I will have a broken heart to leave my loved ones here, I will be so glad to get rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can’t thank Ricky enough, who has been by my side all along and given me a huge amount of love and support during that terrible time,” she wrote on social media, adding that the pain and suffering finally stopped and she found peace.
“I’m also grateful for all the support I’ve received from all of my followers on social media,” she wrote, adding that everyone should value their life and live it to the fullest.
Art vending machines sell sweat dating, mushroom amulet and pexeso
For a hundred crowns, a passing pocket work will be won by most of the beginning Czech artists.
They create images and other creations directly for artmat, so they know in advance that they have to fit into the size of 8.5 to 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"There is always a curatorial text about the artist in the package and then the work itself," said project curator Petra Wid<0xC5><0xBE>ov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Artmat works on the principle of chance.
Thus, the buyer may be surprised at what kind of artwork he gets.
Currently, he can become the new owner of fantasy illustrations by Alexandra <0xC5><0xA0>toplov<0xC3><0xA1> or mini-views by Teresa Bonaventure, which can also be sent.
The artist Punx 23 in collaboration with Dora Dutkov<0xC3><0xA1> has prepared a pexeso associated with walking in Prague.
The cards must be paired with the house signs.
Ilona Polanski created a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladr<0xC3><0xA1>v<0xC3><0xA1> and Juli<0xC3><0xA1>na Chomov<0xC3><0xA1> sell a pocket-sized package of spirituality: the first of the artists offers a protective amulet from a wedding dress and a magic card, the second series of illustrations based on her comic Spiritistka.
Wages in health care will rise by a maximum of five percent next year.
According to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch, a larger increase is unrealistic
Wages in health care could rise by up to five percent next year, Health Minister Adam Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch (for YES) said in V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Moravce’s Questions on Czech Television.
The demand of the experts to increase by up to 15 percent is considered unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective aids.
According to him, the hospitals now have their supplies.
"I think that the increase (of wages) can be somewhere up to five percent," the minister said.
According to him, it is necessary to reflect the current situation, which since March has affected the selection of the coronavirus insurance pandemic and the government regulation against its spread.
Insurers' incomes declined at the time.
"A 15 percent increase seems to me at this moment unrealistic," Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch said.
The average monthly earnings of a doctor in acute bedside care according to the data of the Institute of Health Information and Statistics (<0xC3><0x9A>ZIS) will probably reach 88 312 crowns this year, sisters 47 498 crowns.
The difference between the salary of nurses in state hospitals and the salary of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
Data from <0xC3><0x9A>ZIS also shows that the decline of nurses in hospitals has stopped.
According to data from the Czech Statistical Office, the average salary in the Czech Republic in 2019 was CZK 34,125.
In June, representatives of the experts said that they would demand a minimum increase of ten percent for 2021, ideally by 15 percent.
They criticize in the long run the significant difference between the earnings of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which must be governed by salary tables, and contractual salaries in hospitals in cities, regions or private ones.
They therefore also demand that the pay tables be uniform for health professionals.
For nurses this year, the difference will reach up to seven thousand crowns per month.
For example, in the last year, salaries have risen faster than wages.
According to the President of the Czech Dental Chamber Roman <0xC5><0xA0>mucler, the experts should be aware of the current situation.
The House recently approved an increase in this year's state budget deficit to a record 500 billion crowns, of which 1.75 billion is to go to the salaries of doctors in hospitals and social services.
The Board of Health Care Providers, according to <0xC5><0xA0>mucler, does not agree with the flat-rate salary increase next year.
According to him, the hospitals and medical facilities themselves should decide on the remuneration, and the additional money should go to them through a payment order.
Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch also said that the hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
Pavel <0xC5><0xA0>vagr, Chairman of the State Reserves Administration (SSHR), said this week that the administration does not currently own any health care.
Waiting for the completion of the tenders.
According to Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch, suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March when they were redeemed.
According to him, the state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and also buy from Czech companies.
The dreaded smart quarantine could be taken over by the soldiers.
We are ready, they say.
"Smart quarantine works, of course, is something to improve.
We'll discuss this with the military tonight.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should be able to manage it all again," the prime minister said on his Facebook page.
According to him, it is not possible to sufficiently connect IT systems and hygienic stations, which gradually have to switch to more modern methods of operation.
The problems were, according to the Prime Minister, in the Moravian-Silesian region, where they are one of the current outbreaks.
Defence Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told the <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he did not have information about Sunday's talks and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
According to him, the army is ready for this step.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the army as an advisory body to the government, led by former deputy minister Roman Prymula.
The project was criticised by Interior Minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek (<0xC4><0x8C>SSD) on Sunday.
He also said that he could be recaptured by the army.
The shortcomings in the project were previously admitted by Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Dzurilla, the government commissioner for IT and digitization, who is in charge of it.
“The system works, but it’s still being worked on.
Twenty years it was created separately and unsystematically, now we are trying to unify it in a few months.
It can't be sprayed.
People on the march, poor people on the hygiene on the march are adapting those new systems and actually catching those mistakes," he said.
Ostrava mayor Macura will not run again, because he does not want to "get lost in politics"
The current mayor of Ostrava, Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Macura, will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is the attempt to "get lost in politics," he told Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the presidency of the YES movement, has been mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, he led the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava won almost a third of the vote.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I would last one term and with the experience of the business, I can turn everything around and get on my feet," he told Respect.
He added that during the second election period he was allowed to negotiate to a certain extent.
"But that's the maximum for me.
I don’t want to go into politics,” added Macura, who described himself as a heavy introvert who doesn’t like frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, there has been speculation for a long time about Macro's possible end to the YES movement.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticized the YES movement, for example, for its alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few YES personalities, he supported Zeman’s anti-candidate Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Draho<0xC5><0xA1> in the elections.
Of the YES movement he joined in 2017, Macura does not plan to leave.
"As long as I feel that I can change something in the movement, that it's not a completely futile fight and that no one is in my way, I don't have an immediate motive to end it," he told Respect.
Sixteen-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Prior to becoming mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura served as director of Walmark, a pharmaceutical company.
He has also served in other companies.
Uber, which offers transport services, is returning to Brno
Uber will return to Brno at the end of July, offering transport services.
This is the result of a change in the law, the Brno City Council for Transport Petr Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>l (ODS) said in a press statement on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested against Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as the designation as a taxi or taximeter.
However, since July, the law has changed the conditions for operating regular taxis and alternative ones.
Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>l has held several meetings with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
"Based on them, this company decided at the end of July this year to return to Brno with its services.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows this company to operate legally.
The city has been made aware of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given limits," Kratochv<0xC3><0xAD>l said.
Uber has operated in Brno in the past.
Taxi drivers protested against him for not labeling the vehicles as a taxi or a missing taximeter.
The court issued preliminary measures that banned Uber from driving in the city.
Brno originally supported taxi drivers, but Mayor Markéta Va<0xC5><0x88>kov<0xC3><0xA1> (ODS) said last year that the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to the court rulings, Uber could drive in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of it.
He will now return on the basis of a change in the law.
Since July, it is true that in addition to classic taxis with a flashlight and a taximeter, it is easier to operate the transport service ordered and paid exclusively through mobile applications.
Too big a celebration in Brno: a flying chair fell a metre from a man on a sidewalk
An office chair flew out of the fourth floor of the flat on Saturday evening in Brno and fell about a meter from the sidewalk.
He was followed by a walker who immediately called the guards.
Immediately after arriving at the address in the western part of the city, the patrol noticed an open window, under which there was still a chair and next to it several cans and cans.
"The movement from the room on the fourth floor suggested that there was a rather noisy party going on inside.
The guards went out of the hallway to the apartment and asked three young men present, aged between twenty-six and twenty-nine, for an explanation," police spokesman Jakub Ghanem said.
Rafa’s appeal request will be discussed by Babi<0xC5><0xA1> with <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> (ANO) plans on Monday to discuss with the coalition social democrats a request for the dismissal of the head of the antitrust office (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS) Petr Rafaje.
The appeal of Rafa was called by non-profit organizations to the anti-corruption council of the government and also the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> region.
The Social Democrats say the exchange at the head of the office is in place.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>TK Rafaj, he was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second term ends in the middle of next year, and he cannot be appointed for a third time under the law.
His appeal falls within the remit of President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman.
In addition to the calls of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> Region.
This is due, among other things, to Rafa's recent case.
Last week, the prime minister declined to comment on the request, saying that he would be familiar with the materials and that the government parties would take "any position" on it.
He also said that he has not yet negotiated the challenge with the president, he has no meeting with him in the near future.
According to the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS statement, there is no reason to appeal, because Rafaj was not charged with anything.
The servers IHNED.cz and Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz wrote last week that the police are interested in Rafa’s meeting with the chief of staff Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC4><0x8C>unk.
The meetings were related, among other things, to the decision on the competition for the controversial new Zlin hospital project for eight billion, which <0xC4><0x8C>unek is pushing hard.
The speaker of the meeting admitted, according to him, that they were jointly dealing with his "senatic activities".
Rafa says the same thing.
The representative office of the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> Region called on the government to revoke Rafaje at the end of June.
It also calls for reform of the Authority's decision-making mechanisms.
The decision of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS regarding public contracts according to Deputy Head of Transport Jaroslav Kom<0xC3><0xAD>nka is not transparent and has signs of arbitrariness.
Last March, the police intervened at the antitrust office because of a tender for the selection of a myth.
In June this year, the server Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz pointed out that Rafaj uses apartments written on the company of influential backstage player <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Alexandra <0xC4><0x8C>uba.
A deposit of $3.5 million for an apartment in Brno was paid from Rafa’s account.
The President of the Office for the Protection of Competition is Rafaj since 9 July 2009, for the second term of office the President of the former Member of the Social Democracy appointed in June 2015.
In less than a year, Rafa's second six-year term will expire.
The Antimonopoly Office Act states that the President may dismiss the President of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
It may be revoked only if it has not held office for more than six months or seriously impairs the dignity of its office or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
In the Blanen library, the employees were collapsing in heat.
Helps with air conditioning
The new technology will cost 740 thousand and will be in operation in the second half of August.
“This is good news for me.
With three children we go to the library in the center of Blanska regularly.
In the warm months, however, it was practically impossible to survive there.
There was a terrible heat and bad air.
The wind didn't help.
That's why I like air conditioning," said one of Blanen's readers, Petr Novotn<0xC3><0xBD>.
According to the director of the library Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Dlapy, temperatures in the building often climbed up to over thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the building is glazed and on sunny days it functions as a greenhouse.
"In addition, thanks to the curvature of the building, the sun rests on it for a large part of the day.
At the same time, it is a big problem to ventilate individual compartments, because during the night the window must be closed for security reasons.
We often have this from morning in the library to thirty degrees," said Dlapa.
The worst part was the study and the reading room on the third floor.
And a floor higher then the exhibition room and the director's office.
The unpleasant climate was also in the children's department, which is located under the roof of the building.
"It has happened several times that librarians at work have collapsed and ended up in incapacity for work.
The problem also arose regularly in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, he could no longer breathe," Dlapa said.
Originally, the city representatives wanted to make air conditioning in all the premises of the library this year.
In the end, there will only be three rounds out of five.
“Because of limited funding, only the most problematic areas will have air conditioning.
Study and reading room on the third floor.
Then the cultural room and the children's department on the upper floor," informed Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Svoboda from the Blanen Investment Department.
He added that in the first phase, the workers had already installed air technology and modified the electrical installation in the said premises in the autumn of last year.
For about 360,000 crowns.
The Blansko City Library has almost three thousand registered readers.
That's about nine hundred to fifteen years.
The Chicago support expelled the coronavirus.
Crawford is back in the game.
Not every infected athlete will come out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players who are silent about the players’ health like a grave and don’t publish anything at all.
As one of the few, he stepped out of the Crawford line.
A thirty-five-year-old Montreal native was present only at the first training session, since then missing in the lineup.
"I would like to announce to all of you that I have been tested positive for Covid-19 and have spent the last 14 days in my house," he said.
Fans no longer have to worry about his health.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into the full load.
"It's amazing that I'm back.
I will do everything to get in shape as soon as possible," he added.
An experienced goalkeeper has won two Stanley Cups with Chicagem, a solid part of the goalpost is already the tenth season in a row.
The Blackhawks are due to face St. Louis first, then Edmonton in the lead.
Thousands of people protested in Israel against the prime minister
Thousands of Israelis in several parts of the country have protested against unemployment, corruption and the way Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tackles the coronavirus crisis.
The protests took place in front of Netanyahu’s private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence, and in a park in Tel Aviv.
Protests have been taking place regularly for several weeks in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
Its participants demand Netanyahu’s resignation because of the trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, and also because of how the government is dealing with the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home," one of the protesters wrote on his banner, referring to Netanyahu's well-known nickname.
"Everyone can see that the emperor has lost his dress," another said.
Seventy-year-old Netanyahu is Israel’s first prime minister to be tried in office.
He is charged with three counts of corruption, fraud and misappropriation of trust.
All the charges against him are dismissed, and he calls them witch-hunts.
According to local media, the trial can take up to three years, with more than 300 witnesses summoned.
The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in Israel, which has a population of about nine million, by nearly 60,500 people.
A total of 455 people have died from the disease.
In March, the Israeli government introduced quarantine measures that helped reduce daily increases in those infected.
After the gradual release of restrictions from the end of April, however, especially at the end of June, the number of infected again began to grow significantly.
Netanyahu’s critics argue that the government has not sufficiently helped, for example, the tradesmen affected by the quarantine measures.
The protesters also resent the fact that the government is issuing contradictory instructions in the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver smashed the car into a tree and died.
Firefighters had to cut off the body from the wreckage.
The tragic accident occurred around 11 p.m. near Neveklov in a narrow district leading from Slapsk<0xC3><0xA1> dam.
The driver apparently flew down into the forest at considerable speed and smashed the car into a tree.
He died on the spot.
Firefighters had to clear the body from the wreckage, among other things, they cut off the roof.
The circumstances of the accident are being investigated by the police.
They ordered a court hearing to clarify, among other things, whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other addictive substances.
Stop wasting and squandering one collection at a time.
Pietro Filipi cancels discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a fundamental change of strategy.
She cancels the discounts and no longer wants to flaunt one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is among the largest polluters of the environment is not new.
Billions of pieces of clothing end up in the incinerators and landfills every year.
The view of slow fashion, often despised approach to dressing, but in recent years has changed quite quickly.
About half of Pietro Filipi’s goods were sold at full price.
The second half, which was sold thanks to discounts, simply does not buy.
The company does not want to churn one collection after another and at the end of each season to discount products below their production price.
In addition, according to the owner Michal Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka, the era of new and old collections and blindly following rapidly changing fashion trends are gone.
"Most discount traders already count on the purchase of goods, so much higher margins are included in the full price.
So it’s actually a bit of a scam,” says owner Pietro Filipi Michal Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
In addition, the company wants to support the local business with its approach.
"Each of our products is made from carefully selected quality fabrics and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - i.e. clothes that are timeless and over-seasoned.
Globally, the segment of premium brands is typical of the absence of any discount, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary," adds Mi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
Giant graffiti presents RAF pilot Kurt Taussiga
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot, who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The proposal was liked by the city leadership," said Vacek, who completed his work after fourteen days of intensive work.
It consumed about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish background, the Nazis dragged him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, he and his brother managed to avoid a concentration camp thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton.
In 1939, Taussig arrived in the United Kingdom, where he volunteered to join the Royal Air Force (RAF), and later underwent pilot training in South Rhodesia and Palestine.
He became involved in combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times and his native Teplice, which granted him honorary citizenship.
Forty-six-year-old Kamil Vacek, who has been known in the street art industry under the nickname Camo, has been working with sprays in the streets of Teplice for over 20 years.
Graffiti began on the surfaces, which for these purposes was designated by the then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Storm Hanna arrives off the coast of Texas
Hurricane Hanna arrived on the southwest coast of the U.S. state of Texas on Saturday afternoon local time (before midnight CEST tonight).
He struck the Texas island of Padre Island, about 24 kilometers north of the town of Port Mansfield, and as he moved over the mainland, he weakened into a tropical storm.
According to meteorologists, however, it poses a great danger to the inhabitants of coastal areas.
It has brought with it strong winds and intense rainfall; along with local flooding, power outages and various material damage, including damaged ships, are reported, according to the AP.
Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Saturday declared a state of natural disaster for 32 counties in southwest Texas and recommended a voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warning came from the coastal belt between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but it is expected to reach an area nearly 500 kilometers long before moving gradually over northeastern Mexico.
“Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising levels, a dangerous blizzard and a lone tornado can pose a threat,” the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in a statement.
This morning local time (in the afternoon SEL<0xC4><0x8C>) the storm moved in the area of the US-Mexico border and was accompanied by wind at a speed of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic hurricane season on Saturday.
It was accompanied by winds of up to 145 kilometers per hour over the Gulf of Mexico, but as it progressed to the mainland, it gradually slowed down to 112 kilometers per hour, again knocking Hannu out of the hurricane category.
Local authorities have urged residents to cross the storm at home, not forgetting the hygiene measures associated with the prevention of the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the U.S. states most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Due to the existing security measures and the need to observe the distances, evacuations are also a major challenge.
Provisional shelters were opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter for evacuees who had tested positive for the coronavirus or had otherwise been exposed to the disease.
Local authorities have called on all evacuees to take their robes and disinfectant gels with them into hiding, if possible.
"We don't have that far behind us yet.
We're expecting catastrophic flooding," said Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) in Brownsville.
Forecasts suggest that in some places up to 300 millimetres of rainfall could occur within a few hours, in some cases almost 500 millimetres, which, together with rising sea levels, could flood a number of coastal settlements.
Zeman will lend the rank of colonel to Lipkov
On Wednesday, President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman will confer the rank of Colonel Pavlo Lipkovi.
This is due to the expected events of the Ministry of Defense.
The reason for the assignment of the rank of Brigadier General is the August arrival of Lipka as Deputy Commander of the Alliance’s Multinational Division in the North-East of Poland.
Lipka still works as a representative of the commander of the ground forces of the Czech army.
The promotion to Zeman at the end of June was proposed by the government.
Since the beginning of August, Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karl <0xC5><0x98>ehka as the deputy commander of the multinational division in the north-east of Poland in Elblag, which commands the units of the Alliance's forward presence in the territory of Poland and the Baltic States.
In March, <0xC5><0x98>ehka became director of the National Cyber and Information Security Bureau (N<0xC3><0x9A>KIB).
The government proposed to the president that Lipko be given the rank of Brigadier General.
According to the Act on Professional Soldiers, a higher rank may be conferred on a soldier for the period of performance of the elected function or for the period of performance of the service task that the higher rank requires.
The post of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division shall correspond to the rank of General.
The soldier to whom the rank has been conferred has the same rights and obligations as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to an adjustment of the salary that would correspond to the given rank.
The lease of the rank shall remain pending the reason for which it was granted.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates a high professional readiness and is a role model for subordinates.
It plays an important role in fulfilling the tasks of the armed forces of the Czech Republic, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations," the Ministry of Defence said in June on the proposal for the promotion.
The Wednesday promotion will take place at 12:30 at Prague Castle, attended by the Minister of Defence Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Metnar or the Chief of the General Staff Ale<0xC5><0xA1> Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
The countries of the European Union have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by German Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer.
Among the agreed standards is the observance of distance or wearing of robes in the aircraft and at the airport, however, the middle seats in the aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
It was reported by Reuters.
"I am pleased that my colleagues have adopted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these uniform standards," Scheuer told the European Aviation Conference.
The German transport ministry added that the agreement had been signed by officials and had yet to be formally approved by ministers.
The agreed measures include the requirement to cover the mouth and nose of passengers from six years of age, to observe the recommended distance during security checks and check-in at the airport.
Adequate fresh air must be guaranteed on board the aircraft and all information must be available in several languages.
The airlines will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by the officials shall comply with at least some of the requirements of the air carriers.
Different standards have caused confusion.
The temperature record fell on the Arctic Spitsbergen, where they measured almost 22 degrees
"A 41-year-old record has fallen in Longyearbyen," the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
In the afternoon, the temperature there rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius, beating the 1979 record by 0.4 degrees, he added.
About two thousand Longyearbyen is the largest city on Spitsbergen, located about 1300 kilometers from the North Pole.
Spitzbergs heat up faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This highlights the danger of warming in other parts of the Arctic, from Alaska to Siberia, according to a report by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies last year.
According to him, the average temperature on Spitsbergen has increased by three to five degrees since the 1970s.
By the year 2100, it may even rise by ten degrees if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced to the atmosphere.
The rise in temperature in Spitsbergen can result in the melting of ever-frozen soil, which threatens the stability of many buildings, roads or airports and can also cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming is also threatening Arctic wildlife, such as polar bears or seals, which depend on the ocean’s ice cover.
Britons returning from Spain to face two-week mandatory quarantine
The British government has also urged citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to mainland Spain due to the risk of spreading the disease.
The Canary and Balearic Islands are therefore not mentioned, however, even after returning from them, people have to isolate for two weeks.
The new rules come into force at midnight.
“Protecting public health is our top priority.
"We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in the UK," the British Foreign Office said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a certain country from the safe list," she said.
As the British newspaper Metro noted, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular holiday destinations in the world.
The British, among other things, are worried about whether they will be paid sick if they have to end up in isolation for 14 days after returning from the holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a ten-day holiday to Lanzarote, which was scheduled to depart on Tuesday.
The tour has been booked since December.
"We were supposed to drive the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a driver and I don’t think my employer will accept that I will be quarantined after returning from vacation for two weeks,” the Metro Hunter newspaper quoted him as saying.
In relation to Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of the second wave of the epidemic.
In the last two days, more than 900 newly infected people have been infected every 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, such as Catalonia trying to limit all night life and prevent people from meeting in large numbers.
The Czech Foreign Ministry has recently warned of an increased risk of the disease in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
Model of purchase of electricity from Dukovan discussed by the government
On Monday, the government will discuss a model for the purchase of electricity from the planned new block of the Dukovany Nuclear Power Plant.
The bill envisages that if the purchase price is higher than the price of electricity on the market, the difference will be paid by all consumers through tariffs.
In the second case, where the purchase price is lower than the market price, the impact on the consumer will be the opposite.
Power is an unregulated part of the final price of electricity for the customer.
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek (for ANO) and the energy company <0xC4><0x8C>EZ have previously stated that the more likely option is that people will save electricity thanks to construction.
Analysts, on the other hand, point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, as developments in the past have shown several times.
It has previously been criticized by environmental groups.
"The ransom price can be both below the market price of electricity and above it.
The final impact at the time of applicability of the rule can be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the circuit breaker - at lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - at higher electricity consumption," the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the press release.
Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek said in May that he expects the wholesale price of electricity to rise and people at the Dukovan building will make a profit.
Otherwise, the impact will be in the tens of crowns per year per family, which, according to him, is far less than people pay annually in invoices for electricity to support so-called supported resources.
He had previously estimated that the purchase price could range from 50 to 60 euros (about 1320 to 1600 CZK) per megawatt hour (MWh).
The submitted material does not contain any proposal for the amount, it should be contained only in the purchase contract.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, which is now the most stocked by traders, currently stands at around 45 euros (about CZK 1190) per MWh.
"Despite the difference between the purchase price and the market price of electricity of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100," the average household with consumption of 3.3 MWh per year could make a surcharge of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 per unit - can correspond to a four-member household, standard equipped with electrical appliances including electric hobs and ovens, which does not, however, use electricity for heating.
“We are living in a very turbulent time.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider long-term prediction of market prices to be a highly speculative matter," said <0xC4><0x8C>TK's former CEO of the investment group Energy financial group Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Voltr.
The proposed law assumes that the purchase would be carried out by the MPO or by a state-owned legal entity, respectively, at a pre-determined price.
The contract between the investor and the state guaranteeing the conditions for the purchase of electricity would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of ten years, including repeated, but not longer than until the end of operation of low-carbon production.
A low-carbon production design is defined as the production of electricity with a nuclear reactor connected to an electricity system with an installed capacity of a minimum electrical output of 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek previously said that the new dukovan block should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to a tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The block is expected to be put into operation in 2036.
The model of financing the new Dukovan bloc was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the state without interest during construction, while operating at a 2% interest rate.
The opposition does not agree with the funding model, and is also concerned about the possibility that the Dukovans would build Russian or Chinese companies.
The state should contribute 70 percent to the construction.
The rest should be paid by <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which will also pay any additional costs.
The CEO of CEZ Daniel Bene<0xC5><0xA1> said in May that the expected amount for the construction of the block at current prices is about six billion euros (about 162 billion crowns).
Contracts between the state and <0xC4><0x8C>EZ for the construction of a new Dukovan block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development has downloaded material on support of tourism in the media for two billion
The material according to which the Ministry of Local Development (MMR) planned to spend in the media, on the Internet and billboards for advertising for holidays in the Czech Republic two billion crowns, the office withdrew from the comment procedure.
Minister Kl<0xC3><0xA1>ra Dost<0xC3><0xA1>lov<0xC3><0xA1> (for YES) of the server SeznamZpr<0xC3><0xA1>vy.cz said that the material is still being worked on.
The document in eKlep (electronic library of the legislative process) was pointed out by the server Zdopravy.cz on Friday.
The ministry justified the plan by the collapse of tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, incomes and media declined.
The proposal drew criticism from the opposition and representatives of the tourism industry.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the website hlidacstatu.cz, the MMR planned to give through the state agency for the promotion of tourism CzechTourism money for advertising in televisions, radio, press, the Internet, billboards or surfaces at the stations.
The biggest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would get television.
Most of them would get private TV Nova and Prima.
Printed newspapers and magazines would receive $400 million and the same piece would give the MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on the website.
Radio stations would receive 350 million dollars for a media campaign, most of it back to private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and surfaces at stations or on the subway.
The campaign to support tourism in the Czech Republic was to start in mid-August and last a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in the form that should be presented," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>lov<0xC3><0xA1> said without further details from the News List server.
The material criticized the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Markéta Pekarov<0xC3><0xA1> Adamov<0xC3><0xA1>, the media would benefit from the advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> (ANO).
"I firmly believe that this blatant contempt will get a blow between the eyes in the autumn elections," she wrote on Twitter.
She denies that it is in fact a matter of aid to the media affected by the crisis.
"It could be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support at all," she told the N daily on Friday.
According to him, the budget is two billion indicative.
"Of course, we are still counting it, it can be less and more.
It's work material," she added.
To save tourism does not make sense for a media campaign in support of domestic tourism.
"We want $2 billion for travel companies, not a useless advertising campaign," said Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Bar<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k, president of the initiative.
If those two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should go to companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
Weed of Life, Cock of Beer, and Death as a Grass Stem
The third album is also posthumously titled A Death is a stem of the grass of the Brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Fri<0xC4><0x8D>, who also left the year before, on May 24.
In Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s discography it is the fifth item and, as with previous titles, the main emphasis is on Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s poetry, which he himself is an excellent interpreter.
Fri<0xC4><0x8D>, the 1949 edition, was of course influenced by the American beat generation, but this inspiration was passed down through his own personal experiences as well as his very inner expressions of faith.
But he was far away from any agitation, if he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, absolutely tolerant.
In this context, I think Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradn<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, for example), the masters are sorry.
Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s album offers recordings of the author's reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who have always accompanied him very sensitively, whether it was the cellist Josef Kl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>, or Honza Barton and V<0xC3><0xAD>t<0xC4><0x9B>zslav Holata.
I like the words of the Ostrava poet Petr Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka about Fri<0xC4><0x8D>'s long poetic compositions.
"It was a proud and never-ending bitterness," writes Hru<0xC5><0xA1>ka, "of the state of our world threatened with extinction.
The world, which is increasingly falling into dull consumerism and greed, is increasingly moving away from what its soul was made of—from the mystery of faith, humility, and human closeness.
There was a touch of the one who knows that the values for which he was created are of little interest to him, but who also knows that they cannot be denied merely because of general disinterest.
These poems reminded us that a person may have to lose everything that is precious, but it is not inconsequential how he loses it.
If he sells himself to a general decay, he resigns skeptically, shuts down fearfully, or remains until the last moment in a calm and proud permanence on what he believes and loves.
Paroubek is not my advisor, Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek said
Former Prime Minister and President of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
The party chairman and Interior Minister Jan Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek said this on Prima Partie TV today.
On Friday, the server SeznamZpr<0xC3><0xB3>vy.cz reported that Paroubek should be Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s advisor.
"From time to time we will write an essay, he will occasionally send me some material and I will read it," Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek said today.
He added, however, that this is not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD does not have the means to waste them for similar purposes.
"The fact that I sometimes read his opinion, there are a lot of people like that," he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS member Jana <0xC4><0x8C>ernochov<0xC3><0xA1>, the Minister said that many ODS members are still "incessantly listening to the views of V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus".
This is fine, according to him, because he is an experienced politician and a former party president, which is also the case of Paroubek.
The fact that the media are making an affair of it, he said, is a sign of this year's cucumber season.
The server SeznamZpr<0xC3><0xB3>wy.cz wrote on Friday that Paroubek plays the role of Ham<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s unofficial consultant.
He also wrote that the fourth candidate of the party in the Usti region is headed by the former chairman of the cell Petr Benda, who is associated with Paroubek and acted as vice-chairman of his party LEV 21.

Duplantis has a mile lead, it's a kick in the ass, poor Swede's challenger
It is the 22-year-old American bartender who has the ambition and potential to be one of the most important competitors of the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis two years younger, beat him last year at a meeting of the association of NCAA universities.
"We had a battle a year before, then he won and I was second, then we threw it away.
In both cases it was a very good fight," says Nilsen, who secured the victory with a performance of 5.95 meters.
However, Duplantis has since shot up sharply and is currently alone in the highest tidal spheres.
In just twenty years he became a world record holder, this year on February 8 in Toru<0xC5><0x84> he overcame a bar of 6.17 meters, a week later in Glasgow he added another centimeter.
"He jumped six meters at the age of 18 when he graduated from high school," his roommate Nilsen told the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that as soon as he grew from boy to man, he would multiply his potential and talent in the tens.
“Twenty years is a pretty good age to jump the world record,” he said.
Although Nilsen's list of successes is about knowledge thinner than the one Duplantis is proud of, the American sets himself similar goals.
He has indicated his chances so far at the NCAA races, which he regularly won, this year in February he improved on one of them an internal personal record to 5.93 m. Last August he won a gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, already in 2017 he fought in the American expedition to the World Cup, where he won 13th place.
The next step for him is to try the Diamond League for the first time.
“It’s definitely my priority to get to the professional circuit and race as much as possible in the Diamond League because you can make a name for yourself there,” he says.
"If you can succeed at this level, you can undoubtedly lead as well at events such as the Olympic Games, the World Cup or the Pan American Games."
Due to the pandemic, however, these peak holidays are postponed, which gives Nilsen and other bartenders time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch Duplantis, who can easily turn a race under five circles into a mere silver fight?
"Everyone is trying to reach him, but I don't think it's going to be possible anytime soon," Nilsen said.
"He's been jumping for 16 years, and he's got a mile ahead of everyone else in training."
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, it will want to increase it even more.
The woman spent hundreds of thousands on the disability pension of an impotent son.
The court is waiting for her.
The money that a 33-year-old man receives from the state as a disability pension is primarily intended to improve the quality of his life.
A woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Due to poor health, the court deprived the sick man of his rights and appointed his mother a custodian, who was to manage her son’s money, among other things.
"From mid-November 2013 to this January, a woman used part of her son's disability pension funds for her needs and prepared him for 440,000 crowns," police spokeswoman Dana Ladman said, adding that the accused woman was complaining that she was being held as a guardian of the man's house.
According to the court’s instructions, the woman set up an account for her son, but his pension was sent to her account.
"After paying the costs associated with her son's stay in a medical facility and paying for the necessary medicines, she used the remaining funds to buy a vehicle, electrical appliances and to run the household," the indictment reads.
That he could not use his son's money for his needs, the woman admitted.
But she defended herself by helping them pay for their family expenses.
“We’ve had problems with our incomes tightening the household’s course.
We've never bought anything super standard.
It was always about things that my son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea I was committing a crime," the woman explained to police.
She promised to give the money back to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding tools
Findings from the Chiquihuite cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include 1930s-era limestone tools, including fine blades that could have been used to cut meat, and pointed objects that could have served as spearheads or spearheads.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the tools come from the time 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are here," said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments reach the age of 12,500 years.
According to experts, the people of the Chiquihuite cave, located at high altitude, lived for 20,000 years.
So far, the widely accepted theory has been that the first representatives of the species Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from the area of present-day Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, has shown that this clove culture has subsequently spread to much of North America.
However, this model has received cracks in recent decades, when several ancient settlements were discovered, which were two to three thousand years older.
The second study, published in the journal Nature, looked at 42 different sites across North America that demonstrated human presence on the continent between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some of them were able to get to America by boat.
"It's clear that humans were in America long before the development of the so-called human culture," said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta in Canada.
The interest in the tickets so far fills the optimistic scenario, the sellers claim.
Prices are gradually falling as well.
Ticket sales in the Czech Republic are growing every week.
Compared to last summer, interest is still roughly halved, but demand is growing by up to 20 percent each week.
The post-crisis development thus, according to the sellers, meets the most optimistic scenarios.
The price of tickets is also gradually decreasing.
Among the most sought-after destinations are, according to sellers, especially the South European countries.
According to Kiwi.com, they lead Spain, Italy and Greece.
At the portal Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz, flights to Split in Croatia are the most sold.
From other countries, the UK is the most sought-after, but it has always been one of the busiest destinations in the world.
The average price of tickets is also reduced.
At the Letu<0xC5><0xA1>ka.cz portal, around 6250 crowns were in circulation in the middle of the month, 3000 crowns less each year.
This is mainly due to an increase in demand for European destinations, which now account for about 85 percent of sales.
However, prices are also falling in some European places, for example in Spain or Italy, which have fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behavior of customers who are now buying tickets much less in advance than before, because they are concerned about the further development of the coronavirus situation.
According to Kiwi.com, the time it takes to buy a ticket before departure has been reduced by about ten days each year.
“This confirms the future trend where people will order tickets much less in advance, require more flexibility, less risk,” said Michal <0xC5><0xA0>indel<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>, vice president of Kiwi.com products.
Currently, the average booking time is 21 days before departure.
Along with the increase in sales, the number of renewed airlines from the Czech Republic is also increasing.
Prague Airport currently operates scheduled services to more than 60 destinations.
This is about half of last year’s summer season.
The grand finale tonight!
Watch the darts battle live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament within the PDC organization ended up in the grand final.
It features experienced Scottish archer Gary Anderson at the age of 94 and the surprise of the tournament, Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh at the age of 26.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then ran into his neighbor in the leaderboard.
However, he also dealt with James Wade, and in the quarter-finals he strongly disputed with Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one.
"Flying Scot" was in the semifinals when he faced Michael Smith.
But at the last moment he escaped the tombstone from the shovel, dominated in the extension and after the result 18:16 won a place in the final of the tournament, which he dominated already in 2018, when in an amazing battle he defeated Mensura Suljovi<0xC4><0x8D>e 21:19.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and just maybe the knowledge that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on an absolutely fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old first surprisingly eliminated world No. 6 Nathan Aspinall, in a dramatic battle they overpowered Jo Cullen and in the quarterfinals after a sharp start they beat Adrian Lewis.
The big test was the semi-finals.
Glen Durrant showed his strength right at the start, but in the stillness of the Belgian, he won an excellent series, which he then held on more or less without problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which allowed him to experience occasional uncertainty on doubles.
Coronavirus cases have increased at least since the beginning of the week, the number of tests has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, it has been demonstrably infecting 15,212 people.
Almost 9,600 of them have already been cured, 368 patients have died.
Currently, there are 5,254 people who are sick.
This is according to data on the Ministry of Health website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases this week has exceeded four times in a row two hundred.
There were 281 cases on Friday.
On Thursday there were 235 positive tests, the day before 246 and on Tuesday 206.
On the first working day of this week, 169 people were infected.
In the Czech Republic, 9,590 people have been cured of COVID-19, or 63 percent of all those infected so far.
For most people, the disease was mild.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people with coronavirus in the hospital, 19 of them are considered serious by doctors.
There are several outbreaks of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic.
The most infected in the last seven days, per 100,000 population, still accounts for Karvinsko, almost 59.
This is followed by the district of Jihlava with 56 and Fr<0xC3><0xBD>decko-M<0xC3><0xAD>stecko with 36 infected per 100 thousand inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increase in the number of infected in the Czech Republic, new measures against the spread of coronavirus apply from Saturday.
People must wear robes at indoor mass events over 100 people, it is a cultural and sporting event, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited from the current thousands of people to half.
Worldwide, the number of people who have been proven to be infected with the new coronavirus has already crossed the 16 million threshold.
This was stated by the American Johns Hopkins University, which monitors the development of the pandemic globally.
The death toll from COVID-19, according to this source, is close to 645,000.
The latest million infected people were added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell on July 22.
The United States, which already has more than 4.1 million cases, has had the largest share in the rapid growth in cases in recent days, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where authorities say nearly 1.4 million people have been infected.
The number of infected is now increasing at a record pace.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced this week that more than 284,000 new cases have been reported worldwide since Thursday to Friday, the highest daily death toll since the start of the pandemic.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in people states such as the United States, Brazil or India, according to Reuters, but the number of new cases in the past week has grown in almost 40 countries around the world.
This applies, for example, to Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium or Israel.
The disease has already appeared in almost all countries of the world, the first case officially announced today by the DPRK.
The air in the house is up to five times worse than outside.
Health harms air fresheners and deodorants
Health threatens not only the poor quality of air in outdoor areas, but also at home.
This was pointed out by Israeli human health expert Carol Abraham, quoted by The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who has been credited with setting up Israel’s Ministry of the Environment, household waste needs to be targeted now that many people are spending more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned research by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which says that the quality of domestic air is up to five times lower than that of outdoor air.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year due to poor air quality in their homes.
“Due to the coronavirus epidemic, which has forced many and still forces people to work from home, people have to spend more hours at home than before, so it’s time to focus on air quality in homes,” she said.
In Israel, according to her, the quality of "domestic air" is almost nobody's concern.
Dangerous things can be things that a person usually comes into contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants or pesticides.
“Edible gas is also emitted by the clothes we regularly wear to the dry cleaners,” Abraham said.
According to her, children, elderly members of the household and people with breathing difficulties are the most at risk.
Even otherwise, health individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headache, fainting, irritability of the nasal passages, nosebleeds, vomiting, or skin allergies.
Long-term exposure to unhealthy substances can damage the internal organs and central nervous system.
Not all pests but come from objects inside households, the source can also be the material from which the houses are built.
V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel's Quiz: How long he spent in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada lost her chance to advance to Spain's top football league due to a coronavirus infection in the team.
The management of the competition canceled the originally postponed duel of the last round of the second league, in which the team could ensure participation in the play off.
Fuenlabrada on Saturday reported 12 more infected people, bringing the club's total number of positive COVID-19 tests to 28.
Due to the infection, the team postponed Monday's duel against La Coruni, in which Fuenlabrada scored enough points to get into the play-off.
The management of the competition today stated that the duel against La Coruni definitely withdrew with regard to the higher power due to the fact that it had never been played again.
Fuenlabrada made the decision.
On the contrary, La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a is storming against the failure of the match.
In the end, due to the results of their rivals, even a victory over Fuenlabrada would not be enough to save them, but he considers it unfair that the last round was not played as usual complete in a single term.
The management of a former elite Spanish club is threatened by a court for the fall of the third league.
The first two teams of the Huesca and C<0xC3><0xA1>diz tables have certainty of progress among the elite.
On the remaining third step place in the play-off meet Zaragoza, Almer<0xC3><0xAD>a, Girona and Elche.
Karel Gott didn't like V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel?!
Dominic's Daughter Revealed It
"Dad didn't have to do it for many years," Gott Dominik's eldest daughter told Ah!, noting that the Master couldn't come up with Havel's name, and whenever he came up with a word, Karl was said to have been angry.
It’s hard to say what they did, but according to Dominica, the dispute began sometime in the mid-1990s.
"Dad said in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could have written in the drawer in the dark, but if he had resisted in any way, he would have ended his career," Gott said.
But he adds that in the end the Czech giants found their way to each other.
"I know that the word Havel could not be heard at all in his sixties.
But then the president congratulated him on his birthday and suddenly his father’s relationship with him began to change,” Dominica recalls.
Ten years later, Gott even invited the former president to celebrate his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel in Wenceslas Square.
"And that's where the new era of their relationship began, because Dad then called Mr. Havel regularly to his home in Bertramka," added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slav<0xC3><0xAD>ka also hated that he had never received a state award from V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Havel.
After all, he met him in 2009, although it was already from the hands of his successor in the position of V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus (79).
Other honors will be in memoriam, the current president Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman (75) is to award him the Order of the White Lion and thus honor his memory.
Since Tuesday, heat is threatening in the Czech Republic, meteorologists warn of fires
The warning of meteorologists against high temperatures is valid for Tuesday afternoon for the whole of the Czech Republic with the exception of the Karlovy Vary region and also for southern and central Moravia.
"Exceptionally, temperatures can exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in central Bohemia," they say.
People are advised to adhere to a hot drinking regime and reduce the body weight in the afternoon and afternoon.
Due to the warm weather with minimal rainfall, there will be a danger of fires from Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
The warning of meteorologists against the risk of fires applies to central Bohemia, including Prague, Liberec, <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD>, Karlovarsk<0xC3><0xBD> and Pilsen Region.
The fire warning will be in effect until the appeal.
"We do not expect more significant precipitation to mitigate the danger in the north-west and west of the Czech Republic until at least the end of the week," <0xC4><0x8C>HMU said.
The Prague Magistrate's Office responded to the warning of meteorologists by banning the distribution of fires at risk places, which is due to be paid from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to set open fires, for example, in parks, gardens or forests, up to a distance of 50 meters from the edge of the forest.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also prohibited in these places.
The measure will apply to appeals, Prague Magistrate’s spokesman V<0xC3><0xAD>t Hofman said.
