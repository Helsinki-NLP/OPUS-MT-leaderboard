Members of the Welsh Assembly worry that they are “like Muppet”
Some members of the Assembly are appalled by the proposal to rename themselves MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This was due to plans to change the name of the assembly to the Valencian Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that they will smile.
A member of the Labour-type assembly said they were concerned in their group, “because the name rhymes with Twp and Pwp.”
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means stupidity, and pwp means cacao.
A member of the Plaid Cymru assembly said their group as a whole was “not satisfied” and suggested other options.
The Valencian conservative said his group was “open-minded” about the name change, while noting that there was little difference in pronunciation between the words MWP and Muppet.
In this context, the pronunciation of the Welsh letter “w” is similar to the pronunciation of the letter “u” in the Yorkshire dialect.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce name changes, said: “The final decision on possible descriptors for members of the Assembly will, of course, have to be made by the members themselves.”
The Welsh Assembly has been empowered by the Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals and received broad support for the appointment of the Assembly of the Vali<0xC5><0xBE>ana Parliament.
The name ‘Welsh Parliament Member’ or ‘WMP’ was chosen by the Commission for the members of the Assembly, but ‘MWP’ was the most widely supported option in the public consultation.
Members of the assembly are apparently proposing other options, but reaching an agreement will be a difficult task for the chairwoman, Elin Jones, who is due to submit a draft amendment legislation in a few weeks' time.
Reform legislation will also include other changes to the way the Assembly operates, including rules on the incompatibility of the performance of the functions of the members of the Assembly and the establishment of a system of committees.
Members of the Assembly will participate in the debate on legislation in the final vote on their nomination.
The Macedonians will vote to change the name of the country.
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
By voting, they want to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and has repeatedly opposed its requests for EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the name change plebiscite, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is just the price they have to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin’s Church have been silenced as the churches in Harlem are facing difficulties.
“The older people I’ve talked to say there used to be bars and churches on every corner,” Adams said.
“There is no one or the other today.”
He explained that the disappearance of the bars is understandable.
“People today are different.
Bars are no longer the living room of neighborhoods where people regularly go.”
But with churches, he worries that the money from the sale of funds will not last as long as leaders expect, and that they will soon be back in the beginning.
He added that the churches could be replaced with residential buildings with a common administration (condominiums), where people will live who will not help the shelters in the neighborhood that remain.
“The vast majority of people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore the day will quickly come when all these churches will be closed, because it is unlikely that people who will move into these condominiums will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by the white religious communities before Harlem became the black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original White Methodist church community moved out in the 1930s.
The building was taken over by a black religious community, which performed worship nearby.
St. Martin’s took over the black religious community under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who, on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, was leading a boycott of vendors who did not want to hire or support blacks.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson's parishioners planned a renovation, they ordered bells to be rung.
Honoring David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin’s Church, he proudly named the bells “bells for poor people.”
The expert, who moaned in July, called them a little differently: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also pointed out that these were the first bells to be played by a dark-skinned musician, Dionisio A. Link, who went to Riverside Church 18 years ago, where he was holding large bells.
Mr. Merriweather said he was not replaced at St. Martin's Church.
In St. Martin’s Church, a complicated story has been unfolding over the past few months with architects and contractors; some brought in by church laity and others by the bishopric.
Zakristia, the administrative body of the parish made up of lay people, wrote to the bishop in July that she was concerned that the diocese would “try to pass on the costs” to the parish, even though the parish was not involved in the employment of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about transparency on the part of the bishop.
Sea Dog Hurts 13-Year-Old Man While Hunting Lobsters in California
Officials report that on Saturday in California, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old man while hunting lobsters at the opening of the lobster hunting season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help, then swam with the group to him and helped him pull him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just excited because he caught the lobster, and then he found out that he was screaming, “He bit me!
He bit me!”
When he came to the boy, Hammel noticed that he had a torn whole key.
“I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” he added.
The boy was taken by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The water rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said in a statement to the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was found not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper body.
For 48 hours, those responsible were denied access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s Beach in Ecinitas for investigation and safety.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury’s comes to Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with the beauty spots they have in department stores, and with professional staff.
As part of its entry into the <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion British beauty market, which is still growing as sales of clothing and household appliances plummet, larger beauty spots will be tested in 11 stores across the country and in more stores next year if they prove successful.
They decided to invest in beauty products because supermarkets are looking for ways to fill the shelves that were previously used for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it will double its beauty product offering to 3,000 products and include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing range of L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees brands will also get more space in areas with brands similar to those in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also reviving its boutique offering of cosmetic products, so most of the products are vegan – something that younger shoppers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will test the concession at two Sainsbury’s stores, the first opening last week in Croydon, South London, and the second opening at Selly Oak, Birmingham, by the end of the year.
Because of online shopping and daily shopping for smaller amounts of food at local grocery stores, supermarkets need to do more to convince people to visit.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said retail stores will be similar to department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight off Aldi and Lidl’s discounts with more services and unsavory products.
Sainsbury’s opened Argos outlets in several hundred stores and also Habitat stores, since buying both chains two years ago, which increased food sales and acquisitions were more profitable.
Previous attempts by the supermarket to renovate its departments with cosmetic and pharmaceutical products have ended in failure.
Sainsbury’s engaged in a joint venture with Boots in the early 21st century, but the connection ended after a dispute over the sharing of profits from drugstores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its pharmaceutical company with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
They said Lloyds would play a role in the plan as they expanded the range of luxury skincare brands in four stores, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our beauty corners to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained employees who will be available for advice.
Our range of brands is designed to suit all needs, and the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an interesting beauty destination that presents a challenge to the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones ‘angry’ after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11m job
The star airs Dragons Day (Good Business) infuriated because television host Holly Willoughby withdrew from her <0xC2><0xA3>11 million job with his lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby does not have time for their brand of clothing and accessories Truly.
The company was compared to the Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow.
The head of this morning's show, 37, announced on Instagram that she is retiring.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated the Dragons Den star, Peter Jones, by stepping out of their lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “angry” when the golden girl on television on Tuesday, during a tense meeting at his company’s headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that she no longer has enough time to devote to their brand of clothing and accessories because of her new business – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million.
The company was compared to Goop brand Gwyneth Paltrow and announced that it would double its assets, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that she was leaving the Truly brand, Jones flew out of Britain to one of his holiday homes.
The source said: “Truly was by far the most important thing for Holly.
This would be her long-term future, with which she would spend the next two decades.
Her decision to leave was a complete shock to everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was happening because the opening was so close.
At the company’s headquarters in Marlow, there is a warehouse full of goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the head of broadcast This Morning, which is among the most interesting unions for banks in Britain, the company would have cost several million due to large investments in products, from pillows and candles to clothes and accessories, and additional delays in opening.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband Dan Baldwin were ten years good friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp.
Willoughby founded Truly together with Capp in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined them in March as president.
The couple were vacationing together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I’m A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
It was a difficult conversation and then we fell in love.
He joked about media criticism for commenting on what some consider to be “non-presidential” and a positive opinion of the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump, in his mocking “journalist” voice, said:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He stressed that Kim had shown interest in the second meeting, which Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
But negotiations on nuclear disarmament have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.N. General Assembly that North Korea did not see a “proper response” from the U.S. to previous North Korean disarmament measures.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is continuing with sanctions that continue to put pressure on it.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We wanted to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a good relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results – they stopped testing missiles, helped free hostages, and brought home the remains of U.S. soldiers.
He also defended his unusual approach in talking about relations with Kim.
“It can be very presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded full stage, we have 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia has devastated the island, killing several hundred people.
For example, when addressing the consequences of the Lombok earthquake, foreign NGOs were told that they did not need their help.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been displaced, they have not declared a natural disaster, a condition for sending international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they do not require international assistance, so the situation is somewhat complicated,” she said.
Save the Children is a team that will travel to Pal, but it is not yet clear if foreign personnel will be able to help on the ground.
Sutopu, a representative of the national disaster agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu and determining whether they would allow international agencies to help.
Given that earthquakes in Indonesia are a constant, the country remains completely unprepared for the wrath of nature.
Although shelters were built in Aceh after the tsunami, this is not a common practice on other coasts.
The loss of life was likely due to the apparent absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, although the warning was valid.
Traveling between many Indonesian islands even in the best of times is a challenge.
Due to natural disasters, logistics are even more complicated.
The hospital ship, which is anchored in Lombok to help the victims of the earthquake, is sailing towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo put the improvement of the destroyed Indonesian infrastructure at the forefront of his election campaign and spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
But the financial deficit poses a problem for Jok’s administration in re-election next year.
Yoko also faces pressure from long-standing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have embraced a more conservative form of the faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands evacuated from their homes as Christian and Muslim mobs fought in the streets with machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons.
Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge hit for late draw against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat to Chelsea in the 1st English League on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London with an 89th-minute score.
Sturridge accepted Xherdan Shaqiri's hand a good 25 meters ahead of Chelsea's goal at the back of his team 1-0.
He put the ball on his left and fired a shot at a remote gate.
The shot traveled high above the penalty area towards the upper right corner of the gate.
In the end, the ball went down through the goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the goal.
“I was just trying to get to the right position for the ball and players like Shaq are always pulling it forward as much as they can, so I was just trying to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming, so after one touch I didn’t think much about it and decided to shoot.”
Chelsea led 1-0 at halftime with the Belgian player Eden Hazard scoring in the 25th minute.
In this action, the Blues striker handed the ball back to Mate Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> with the fifth and escaped to Liverpool's half.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly handed in the middle and ran forward.
Then he gave a nice pass through the defense and Hazard escaped to the penalty area.
Hazard overcame the defense and shot with his left foot against a distant goal via Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will host Videoton in the Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country’s disaster agency said on Sunday morning.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings as a result of Friday’s 7.5 magnitude earthquake that triggered six-metre waves.
Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is littered with the ruins of buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
Police have launched a murder investigation after a woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The 44-year-old with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. in the Grayson Mews building on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling on all those who have been in the area and have seen or heard anything to make a statement.
Detective Inspector Brian O’Hagan said: “The investigation is at an early stage, but I call on everyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have caught something on camera footage, to contact us as they may have information that is crucial to our investigation.”
A police official confirmed that the woman was a resident of Birkenhead, and the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, friends came to the scene of the crime, who thought they knew the woman, and asked where they found her this morning.
Investigations are underway, and the police are informing the woman's relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, just tried to return to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed to enter or exit the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents have now been told that it may take several hours before they can re-enter.
The police officer was heard explaining to the man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, all in tears.
He goes on to say, “It’s so horrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the cordon, and another was immediately outside it.
A number of police officers stood inside the cordon and watched the apartment block.
Anyone with any information is asked to write to @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, quoting the September 30 issue of Journal 247.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has become the latest memorial target in the dispute over "rewriting history"
Its removal would be a poetic right for the destruction of numerous English cultural and religious artifacts by fanatical adherents of Puritanism.
But the Cromwell Society labeled Crick’s proposal “foolishness” and “an attempt to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “In today’s debate on the removal of statues, it has become clear that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster will become a target.”
The iconoclasm in the English civil wars Cromwell neither commissioned nor executed.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor from the last century.
The brilliant presentation of Cromwell by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft is a testament to 19th-century opinion and is part of a history of personality that some still believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwella is seen by many (perhaps even more in the late 19th century than it is today) as a protector of parliament from external pressure, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is a perfectly accurate representation is the subject of constant historical debate.
It is clear that the dispute in the middle of the 17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable individual who represents one side of this divide.
His achievements from his time as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated.”
Killer Pig Slaughters Chinese Farmer to Death
According to local media, a pig attacked and killed a farmer at a market in southwest China.
A man identified only by the name "Yuan" was found dead with a slashed artery and covered in blood near a pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
The swine flu vaccine is being prepared on a pig farm in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
According to reports, she and her cousin arrived from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the neighboring pig was open.
He said there was a large male pig with a bloody mouth in the pig house.
A forensic investigation confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig had crushed a farmer to death.
“The cousin’s legs were bloody and disfigured,” the cousin with the surname “Wu” was quoted as saying by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan coming to the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that attacked Yuan was neither his nor his cousin's.
The market manager told Evening News that the pigs had been locked up so that no one else could be attacked while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market management are said to be negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing severe bodily harm to the man.
Ten years earlier, a 300-kilogram pig squeezed a Welsh farmer by a tractor, but then a woman drove the animal away.
After the pigs ate a farmer from Oregon in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “spider.”
“We would just play.
They're like little kids, very curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to show them enough respect,” he said.
To the southwest of the United States due to the remnants of Hurricane Rosa comes a heavy rain
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is moving towards the colder waters of the northern coast of Mexico and getting worse.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring flooding to the north of Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
Rosa is a Category 1 hurricane with a wind speed of 137 km/h and is located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenie in Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a low-pressure area is strengthening, moving east toward the west coast of the United States. Rosa will approach the Baja California peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm and will push high tropical moisture north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, tropical moisture, which will mix with the low air pressure zone, will create abundant precipitation in the wider southwest area in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 100 mm of rain will cause dangerous flooding, flood disposal and the possibility of landslides in the desert.
Due to high tropical humidity, rainfall in some places will approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwestern parts, especially over much of Arizona, precipitation is expected to range from 50 to 100 mm.
Floods are possible due to the rapid deterioration of the situation due to the scattered nature of tropical rain.
It would be very reckless to walk into the desert when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into barren rivers, and storms will bring local gusts of wind and dust into the air.
The approaching area of low air pressure will bring local rain to parts of the coast of Southern California.
Rainfalls above 12 mm are possible, which can result in less flooding and slippery roads.
This will be the first rain for the region in the rainy season.
Some scattered tropical areas will begin to approach Arizona on Saturday late afternoon and Monday early in the morning, late Monday, and on Tuesday, rainfall will spread.
Heavy rain will spread across the sky on Tuesday and will continue on Wednesday.
There may be large temperature fluctuations in the United States in October, as the Arctic cools and the tropical regions remain quite warm.
Sometimes this causes dramatic changes in temperatures over short distances.
Sunday is a great example of a dramatic temperature difference in the central part of the United States.
There is a 20 degree difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, summer temperatures will try to set and expand again.
Most of the Central and Eastern U.S. will enter warm October with temperatures around 27°C from the Southern Plains region to parts of the Northeast.
In New York, it could be 27°C on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast shows good prospects for temperatures above average for the east of the United States in the first half of October.
More Than 20 Million People Have Mirrored the Hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
More than 20 million people watched on six television networks an interesting Thursday testimony by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which was supposed to occur in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued as television stations interrupted the regular program due to Friday's last-minute reshuffle: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Justice Committee that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had found her guilty and tried to take her down at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in a heated testimony that he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
Nielsen reports that more than 20.4 million people are expected to witness on Friday.
The company counted the average viewing of television networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately available to other witness networks, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some problems with the number of viewers watching the program in the offices.
For an easier performance, the audience is similar to that of playing a football match ending or awarding awards to the American Film Academy.
The Fox News Channel, whose leaders strongly support Kavanaugh’s appointment, leads the broadcast of the full-day hearing in front of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen reports.
In second place is ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, and CNN 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest also remained high after the hearing.
Flake had a pivotal role in Friday's drama.
After the office of the moderate Republican made a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanough, CNN and CBS television cameras recorded on Friday morning how protesters shouted at him as he tried to enter the elevator to attend the Justice Committee hearings.
He hung up his eyes for a few minutes during the game, which was captured live by CNN cameras.
“I’m standing here in front of you,” a woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
“You have power, but many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had made a statement, adding that he would say more at the committee hearing, and then the elevator door closed.
All television networks were also broadcast live hours later, when the Justice Committee voted on the handing over of Kavanaugh's nomination to a Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if they agreed that the FBI would investigate charges against the candidate next week, which a minority Democratic party has called for.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake's vote was decisive, as it was obvious that Republicans would not have a vote to appoint Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an investigation by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of “playing political games” in Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of “playing political games” with Britain’s future and undermining the national interest.
The arrival of British Prime Minister Theresa May at a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside the one with her on the cover of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson stepped up his attack on her so-called Brexit plan from Chequers, saying the proposal to have Britain and the EU pay tariffs on others was “completely absurd.”
Shooting at Wayde Sims: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson, Suspected of LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
According to a report by Baron Rouge police, 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and taken to prison on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials posted a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson and police said Sims lost his sunglasses during the fight.
The police found sunglasses on the scene and on them Simpson's DNA, CBS television complements the reports of the television WAFB.
After Simpson's interrogation, police made a statement that he confessed to shooting Wayde to death.
The bail is $350,000, according to a lawyer.
A reviewer from East Baton Rouge Parish on Friday issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
Police are thanking a special unit of the Louisiana State Police for assisting in the investigation leading to the arrest, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police, and the residents of the area.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for their “concern and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 201-centimeter attacker grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU coach Will Wade said the team was “shocked” and “shocked” by Wayde’s death.
“That’s what worries you all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano roars ash in Mexico City
The ash that erupts from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern neighboring Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano, as activity in the crater intensified and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded in 24 hours.
The center has observed several cases of thunderstorms and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in the neighborhoods of Mexico City’s capital, such as Xocchimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in a volcano 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, after a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police units and thousands joined rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarised vote to secede.
A group of masked supporters of separatism, held by riot police units, smothered them with eggs and metal powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually flooded with tourists.
Later there were also clashes, where the police had to use commas to stop the clashes.
Supporters of independence, who cried out for hours “without forgetting, without forgiving,” faced protesters who supported unity and shouted “Long live Spain!”
According to local media, 14 people suffered minor injuries in the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which was declared illegal in Madrid and was celebrated by Catalan separatists, tensions in the independence-supporting region remain.
The vast majority of voters voted for independence, although turnout was low, as opponents of secession largely boycotted the election.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the vote in the region in violent clashes.
Pro-independence groups camped in front of voters overnight to prevent demonstrations and thus support the state police.
Demonstrations continued, but they had to take a different path.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped Catalonia would become independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out of happiness because they could vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite an important, albeit narrow victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence-supporting parties have found it difficult to maintain the initiative this year, as many of the most well-known leaders are either in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organising a referendum and subsequent evictions.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded a protest in support of the police by phone, explained that the protest was fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The tension is rising,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year before the start of the trial, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
“Candidating in the European elections is the best way to condemn the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen in the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry arrests men who drove into the house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested for repeatedly crashing into a house in Londonderry by car.
The incident took place on Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the door and the building itself were damaged.
At some point, they were also supposed to shoot at the car with a shotgun.
With Menga's score, Livingston won 1-0 against the Rangers.
Dolly Menga secures victory with his first goal for Livingston
Livingston stunned the Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to concede his second loss in 18 games as the club's coach from Ibrox.
Dolly Meng's shot made the difference, as Gary Holt's team equalled the Hibernian's in second place.
Gerrard's team is thus left without a win in the guests in this year's championship, and next Sunday they are waiting for Hearts, who leads on the ladder and behind them by eight points.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston has increased his undefeated streak in the division to six games and head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet experienced a defeat.
Livingston has squandered his chances against direct guests
Holt’s team should have been leading well before the score because they caused a lot of trouble with their directness to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson made the breakthrough, but he sent the ball over the door frame, then Alan Lithgow hit past the door, and Craig Halkett shot his head over the goal.
The hosts left the game to the Rangers, knowing that they could be dangerous to the guests at break-ins in the attack.
And that’s how they got to the key goal.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free-kick, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson prepared an action for Menga, who fired and hit from the middle of the penalty area.
The Rangers had greater possession of the ball, but the home defense could not break through and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not have much work.
This pattern continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly's defense.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor defended Scott Pittman's shot with his foot, and Lithgow shot past the goal from another Livingston break in the attack.
The motions continued to come to Livingstone’s courtroom, but the locals rejected all the attacks, two of the offenses – Halkett’s offense over replacing Glenn Middleton and the offense for hand-playing – but the judge did not concede.
Livingston's "Great Performance" - Analysis
Alasdair Lamont (BBC Scotland) at Tony Macaroni Arena
Great performance and result for Livingston.
Quite all of them were excellent and continue to exceed expectations on their way up.
The style of the game and the cast have not changed much since their return to the top, but Holt must be credited for the way he has awakened the team since his arrival.
There were a lot of heroes.
Captain Halkett played an extremely important role and well-arranged a well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on standby all the time.
The Rangers simply lacked inspiration.
Although they are exceptional under the leadership of Gerrard, they are sorely lacking in these standards.
There was a lack of shots on goal – only once they successfully beat the hosts’ defenses – and it’s kind of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the ladder.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, smiles and blue skies prevailed.
Today is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
There have been disputes over human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then traveled to Cologne to open a giant new mosque.
The city is home to the largest number of Turkish population outside Turkey.
For security reasons, the police prevented the crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters managed to get closer to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, who do not support Erdogan’s government, condemned Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to greet him in the country.
Opposing protests reflect the divisiveness of the visitor, which some German Turks hail as a hero and others despise as an autocrat.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist was fatally injured in a car crash
In London, a cyclist was fatally injured in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on the Deptford Road in the southeast of the city at about 10.15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and rescuers arrived, but the man died at the scene of the accident.
The accident took place just months after the cyclist died in a collision in which the car driver fled, on Childers Street, about 1.5 km from Saturday’s accident.
Police said they are checking the man’s identity to be able to inform his family members.
They set up roadblocks and diverted bus lines, and motorists were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six guards injured in crash
Six prison guards were injured in an incident in a heavily guarded man's prison, the prison administration said.
The riot broke out at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday at around 9.30 a.m. British daylight saving time and is still going on.
Police specialists from the Tornado unit were called to take care of the incident, which involved eight prisoners and was limited to one wing.
The guards were provided with minor injuries to the face on the spot.
A spokesman for the prison staff said: “We have called a specially trained staff to take care of the incident at HMP Long Lartin prison.
Six members of staff were injured.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the police will be responsible for this and may therefore be further behind bars.”
There are more than 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin prison, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was reported that the manager of the prison was in hospital care because he was attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, they called a riot police unit to intervene in a major incident in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Pheonix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (which may be beneficial for dry areas)
Tropical depression rarely reaches Arizona, but this is likely to happen early next week, as the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa makes its way through the southwest desert and carries the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued warnings of sudden flooding for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Hurricane Rosa is set to rage over Phoenix on Tuesday and will approach late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that “only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status within 300 kilometers of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) raged 60 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict 50 to 100 mm of precipitation with individual rainfalls of up to 150 mm at Mogollon Rome in Arizona.
In other areas of the southwestern desert, including the Rockies and Great Basin areas, rainfall is expected from 25 to 50 mm, individual precipitations of up to 100 mm are possible.
For areas outside the danger of sudden floods, the rains of Hurricane Rosa may be a blessing, as the region has been hit by drought.
Although floods are a very serious problem, part of the rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the south-west is currently experiencing a dry season.
“According to the U.S. drought tracking center, a good 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought,” Weather.com reports.
The path of Hurricane Rosa first leads to the mainland of the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
Rosa, which still has the power of a hurricane on Sunday morning with a maximum wind speed of 137 kilometers per hour, is 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenie in Mexico and is moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm comes into contact with colder waters in the Pacific and therefore weakens.
It is expected that the land in Mexico will be reached by the power of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico can be abundant and therefore pose a great risk of flooding.
“From the Baja California peninsula to the northwest of Sonoran, we expect 75 to 150 mm of rainfall with a 250 mm chance of precipitation,” the weather.com website reported.
Hurricane Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday as a tropical depression that will then travel through Arizona and toward southern Utah until late night on Tuesday.
“The greatest threat we expect from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is heavy rains on the Baja California peninsula in northwest Sonora and the American Southwest desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These precipitations can cause life-threatening sudden flooding and flooding in deserts and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after they found a 16-year-old man with stab wounds in Somerset.
The injured teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at around 4.00 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition remains “stable.”
The 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested at night in the Radstock area, according to police from Avon and Somerset.
Police are calling on anyone who may have caught the incident using a mobile phone to report it.
Trump Says Kavanaugh Suffered ‘Unfriendliness and Anger’ From Democratic Party
“The voice for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the ruthlessness and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had “suffered the hostility and anger” of the Democratic Party in the process of his appointment.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, clearly and emotionally denying allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford also testified about his allegations.
The president said on Saturday that “Americans saw Kavanaugh’s brilliance, quality and courage” that day.
“The voice for the appointment of Judge Kavanaugh is the voice for the appointment of one of the best legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly mentioned Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Five more weeks to one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I’m really looking forward to the nomination,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere.”
Trump says Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first crucial procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a Republican Party adviser told CNN.
Hundreds of people killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, the number of victims is increasing
Authorities reported on Saturday that at least 384 people had died in the earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, many carrying huge waves that hit the coast.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu on Friday as six-metre waves hit the coast in the dark, killing many and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the threat of a tsunami arose yesterday, people stayed on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they became victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s disaster relief agency, told a meeting in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it dragged cars, trees, houses, it knocked everything to the ground,” Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami was traveling across the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
He said a few people climbed trees to escape the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Photos from the air released by the disaster agency show destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and demolished bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Earthquakes continued to batter the coastal city on Saturday.
In an area of 2.4 million people, a number of earthquakes have been felt.
The Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday’s powerful earthquake is about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima in World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long and narrow bay, is expected to further increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as “extensive” and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of buildings, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho explained that the casualties and damage may be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in the area of Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
As Nugroho said, communications are completely cut off and they have no information from the Donggal area.
“More than 300,000 people live in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
“It’s a tragedy, but it can get worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received a number of criticisms as it did not inform the public that the tsunami had hit Pal, but officials say the waves came just at the time of issuing the warning.
In an amateur video posted on social media, it is heard that a man on the upper floor screams warning people on the street of approaching tsunamis.
Within a few minutes, the water wall hit the shore, taking buildings and cars with it.
At Reuters, they could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Authorities say the military has begun shipping cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees are still in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city airport was only open to provide assistance and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to more than 800.
It's very bad.
According to Mr. Dosebe, members of the World Vision organization from Donggale arrived safely in Pal, where employees in the courtyard in front of their premises set up a shelter from the ponies, but saw numerous scenes of devastation along the way.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
It's very bad.
Even when aid groups launched disaster relief initiatives, some complained that foreign aid workers with a lot of experience would not be allowed to come to Pal.
Under Indonesian regulations, overseas financing, supplies and staff assistance are only allowed if the site of the accident is declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“It is still treated as an accident at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a representative of the Indonesian Red Cross.
“When the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international aid, but there is no such status yet.”
On the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and relatives of the missing cling to the hope that their near miracles are in the sad stories of natural disasters.
A boy was pulled from the sewer on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days and her mother’s body was lying next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of Indonesia's national sailing team, has been training two missing sailing parachutes for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others, trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, were, according to Mr. Mandagi, his students.
“As an elder in the field of sailing parachutes, I bear my emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalls how in the hours when news of the cancellation of the Roa Roa hotel circulated through the community of sailing parachutes, in desperation, he sent messages in the WhatsApp app to competitors in Palu, who took part in the festival on the beach.
But his messages were marked with only one gray dot instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
The thieves stole 26,750 USD while filling an ATM in the center of Newport on the Levee
According to Newport police, the thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning from a security guard at Brink’s, who was filling an ATM in Newport on the Leeve.
The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver the money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in a statement.
While he was busy, another man “came up to an employee of the Brink’s security service from behind” and stole a bag of money for delivery.
According to reports, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify the exact number of participants in the event.
Anyone with information on the identities of the suspects should call the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He tweeted the change on Saturday, writing: “Being with the official name of Kanye West.”
The 41-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and also used it for the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes just before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, in which he is supposed to present his new album Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariano Grande, who canceled the show for “personal reasons,” the show’s creator said.
The word is an abbreviation of his current professional name, but West has already said that the word has religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible that means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year when speaking to radio host Big Boy about the title of the album.
“I am you and I am all of us.
Kanye, which means “the only one,” I turned into Ye – it reflects our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
The album is a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is one of many famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was named Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, and this year he expressed a desire for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z, also used his name differently; with or without thinking about it and in capital letters.
Mexico’s AMLO president says he won’t use military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andress Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of bloody violence against students.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when leftist student movements began to operate in Latin America, on October 2, 1968, soldiers began shooting and killing 300 people at peaceful demonstrations in the market.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support young Mexicans and provide students with monthly grants and open several free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of opportunities for education draw young people into criminal societies.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the funds it spends on research in this area, says AI investor and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the U.S. government announced the use of artificial intelligence, although the U.S. does not have an official AI strategy at all.
In the meantime, China presented its plan last year: their goal is to become the best in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
“The doubling of the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are pretty much for the U.S. and we’re looking for the next breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling funding could double the chances of the next major AI breakthrough happening in the U.S., Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by the publishing house Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most visible minds in the world.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he developed a system of artificial intelligence that defeated the highest-ranked American player of the game Othello, and later was the CEO of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee said he was familiar with previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) robotics competition, and asked when the next one would make it easier to find the next visionaries.
Researchers in the U.S. must work hard if they want to receive state support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that takes over the best academics, it’s companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired the best from universities to develop artificial intelligence.
Lee also said that changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. strengthen efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think people with a PhD in artificial intelligence should automatically be offered a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China issued a development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence.
China’s National Science Foundation funds people in academic institutions, much like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is poorer, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which brings together partners from the industrial and academic sectors, and the White House announced the creation of a narrower committee on artificial intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in AI Next.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) is currently investing more than $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation, which sought to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, has done nothing for months.
The Macedonians will decide in a referendum to change the name of the country
Macedonian citizens voted in a referendum on Sunday to change their country’s name to “Republic of North Macedonia” to resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has opposed their bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents the right to their territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The government reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents say the change will destroy the ethnic identity of the majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum, and the boycott campaign expressed doubts that the turnout would be at least 50 percent, as long as it was necessary for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the referendum list was: “Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU by accepting an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that this is a price worth paying for joining bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
Today I have come to vote for the future of the country and for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means safer lives for all of us,” said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although not legally binding, enough members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote, which will be decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported by 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 per cent compared to 34 per cent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their votes.
“I came to vote for my children, our city is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Gjose Tanevski, a fan from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko cast their ballots in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018 for a referendum on changing the country’s name to pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents, which were placed by those who would boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads raised, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, for example China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
“I believe that a large majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens support the EU and NATO,” Zaev said after his ballot was handed out.
He added that a positive result would be “confirmation of our future”.
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, which is less than the required voter turnout.
A second poll conducted by Macedonian TV Telma showed that 57 percent of respondents would vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent would vote in favour.
For a referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
A failed referendum would be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy, which took office in May last year.
Sergio Aguero from Manchester City replayed Brighton’s entire defence and hit
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling played Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero's 65-minute strike looked ridiculously easy.
At the beginning of the action, the Argentine striker accepted a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran between Brighton's three defensive players and found an open space.
Aguera was then surrounded by four green players.
He replayed one defensive player and was faster than the others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
Then he handed Sterling over to his left.
With his first touch in the penalty area, the English striker returned the ball to Aguer, who defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right foot and sent the ball to the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with leg problems,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We have agreed to play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that point.”
But Sterling was the one who gave the Blues an early lead in the Premier League.
The goal was scored in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero took the ball deep into Brighton's half.
He gave the ball to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane touched the ball several times, then sent the ball to Sterling against a remote goal.
The Blues forward pushed the ball into the net just before it flew past the goal.
City will face Hoffenheim at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany, at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday in the Champions League group stage.
Scherzer wants to play against the Rockies and spoil their chances for the title
The Nationals team is out of the playoffs, so there's no particular reason for a new attack.
But Scherzer hopes he can climb the metal hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, only if the Rockies still have a chance to play in the final, as they have a game advantage over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western League.
The Rockies secured a 5:2 win over the Nationals on Friday, but are still waiting for their first title in the division.
“Although we can’t win anything, at least we will be able to play in a great atmosphere in front of a big crowd here in Denver and the opposing team will play at probably the highest level this year.
“Why don’t you want to compete?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the name of the first metaller for Sunday, but it will likely be the metal Scherzer in this case.
Scherzer, who will be the first metal player for the 34th time, will have enough days of rest on Thursday.
The Washington right-hander collected 18 wins and 7 losses this season with an average of 2.53 runs and 300 rebounds in 220 2/3 shifts this season.
Trump at the West Virginia Conventions
The president indirectly touched on the situation regarding his election to the Supreme Court of Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter turnout in mid-term elections.
“Everything we’ve done will be at stake in November.
Five more weeks to one of the most important elections in our lives.
This will be one of the biggest – I really try to run, so I’m fighting for great candidates everywhere,” he said.
Trump continued, “We have this horrible, horrible, radical group of Democrats, and it’s happening right now.
They are determined to re-take power, using all possible means. You can see the insolence, the malice.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to trample to get power and control, because that’s what they want, power and control, but we’re not going to give it to them.”
In his words, the Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
“And you could see that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry, mean, low-key, and false.”
He named a member of the Justice Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, and a loud disapproval was heard from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you publish the document?
Um, um, what.
No, um, no, I'm not, wait. That was really a bad body rumor, the worst thing I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer open to different views.
To those who express their opinion, she is impatient.
When a Momentum activist in my local party gave me a no-confidence vote, it wasn’t even a surprise.
After all, I am the last member of Parliament from the Labour Party who is not wanted for expressing his opinion.
My fellow Member, Joan Ryan, did the same thing because she strongly opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, it was a no-confidence motion for my disagreement with Jeremy Corbyn.
Regarding the importance of responsible economic policy, national security, Europe. Ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
In a statement on Friday, the Nottingham East Labour party said it "wants the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
In the eight years that I have been a member of parliament of the local Labour Party, Friday’s meetings were mostly exactly like this.
Unfortunately, this tone is not used in most meetings today, and the promise of a “kinder and gentler” policy has long been forgotten if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different views in the Labour Party are not acceptable and it is judged in every opinion whether this is acceptable for the leadership of the party.
This started soon after Jeremy became the leader, and colleagues who I thought we shared similar political views expected me to change my mind and take positions that I would otherwise never agree with – be it in the area of national security or the EU single market.
When I speak publicly – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – there are criticisms on social networks that call for no-elections, condemn the middle class politics, and tell me I shouldn’t be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments addressed to me are only political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist abusers on a daily basis, but they are not afraid.
One of the most regrettable aspects of this period of policy is how levels of abuse have become quite commonplace.
Jeremy Corbyn explained last week that the Labour Party must promote a culture of tolerance.
But the reality is that we are no longer open to different opinions, and with each proposal of mistrust or change of rules for the choice of the party becomes more narrow-minded.
Over the past two years, I’ve received a lot of advice to keep my head down and not be so loud, but it will be “all right” with me.
But I didn’t get into politics because of it.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student – the reason for this was the negligence of the Tatcher government, which caused the classroom in my elementary school to literally collapse – I, as a local councillor or government minister, have tried to advocate for better public services for those who need them most.
I have never hidden my political beliefs, including in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East party could be confused by my political views and areas that I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that I do not understand their desire to waste time and energy discussing my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party at a time when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services.
But my real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for my constituents and voters, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to have served you, and I promise you that no threat of election or political expediency will deter me from acting in your best interests.

Ayr 38:17 Melrose: undefeated Ayr to the top of the ladder
Two well-known attempts have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr earned a victory in this wonderfully entertaining first-round match of the day.
Now they are at the top of the ladder and are the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, the scale on the home side overtook their top defense and better exploit the opportunity and coach Peter Murchie had a good reason for satisfaction.
“We’ve gone through a lot of tests in our games so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Congratulations to the Ayra team, the opportunities were better than we were.”
The 14-minute hit by Grant Anderson, which was converted by Frazier Climo, led Ayr to lead, but the yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, which he received in a game with the Warriors, meant numerical superiority for Melrose and Jason Baggott missed the attempt without conversion.
Climo increased his lead for Ayr at the time of the foul, before hitting right at halftime and then turned a free-kick attempt for a 17:5 result for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half very well, and Patrick Anderson's attempt to turn Baggot down the lead to five points.
It was followed by a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried away on stretchers, and then Ayr progressed with an attempt by Stafford McDowall to turn him into Climo.
Provisional Captain Ayra Blair MacPherspon then received a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of the player's play more with Bruce Colvine's unconverted attempt at the end of a period of violent pressure.
But the hosts returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for obstructing Climate without a ball, MacPherson was hit in the attack.
Climo scored points after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's shot and sent winger Gregor Henry on the fifth try of the hosts.
Star of the series Still Game begins a new career in catering
The star of the series Still Game Ford Kieran is apparently going into catering,to become the director of a licensed company with restaurants.
The 56-year-old in the popular BBC series, for which he also wrote the script, plays Jack Jarvis along with long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two announced that after the upcoming ninth season is the last, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the official documentation, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source suggested to the Scottish Sun that Kiernan wanted to join the "flowering hospitality" in Glasgow.
“The sea is ours”: Bolivia, which has no access to the sea, hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines are patrolling the headquarters of the Navy in La Paz.
On public buildings are hung navy blue flags.
The maritime bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are covered with the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It’s our duty to get it back.”
In mainland Bolivia, the memory of the loss of the coast in a bloody dispute over natural resources with Chile in the 19th century is still alive – as is the longing for a re-navigation of the Pacific Ocean.
This hope is perhaps the greatest in decades now, as Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will be received after five years of consultations on 1 October.
“Bolivia has a drive, a spirit of unity and impartiality, and of course, in a positive spirit, it expects results,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look at the International Court of Justice’s decision on the country’s big screens and hope that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia, which claims that after decades of volatile talks, Chile must negotiate Bolivia’s access to sovereign access to the sea.
Evo Morales, a charismatic Bolivian native president who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year, also has high expectations for Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not decide in favor of Bolivia – and even if it did, not much would change.
The Netherlands-based UN body does not have the authority to allocate Chilean territory to Bolivia, and will not decide on the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s decision comes just six months after the final arguments were heard means that the case “wasn’t complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years have not spoken in favor of Bolivia, but it may cost a lot.
“The current Bolivian government has taken advantage of the issue of access to the sea,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>ratejeva said.
Morales’s aggressive rhetoric from the Chileans shattered all the good will that may have remained, she explained.
Talks between Bolivia and Chile will continue at some point, but after that it will be extremely difficult to participate in the discussions.
The country has not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Veltzé, Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court had taken a decision unusually quickly.
Monday will provide Bolivia with “an extraordinary opportunity for a new period of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – used the maritime issue as political support.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“Decision is an opportunity to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Won't Happen If It Can't Trust U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said his people would never be the first to destroy their nuclear weapons if they could not trust Washington.
Ri delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
The United States has called for the fulfillment of its promises made at a meeting of leaders of rival countries in Singapore.
His statement comes at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is apparently ahead of the restart of nuclear diplomacy, which was at a dead end, more than three months after meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Ri says the U.S. is wrong to think that the continuation of sanctions and opposition to the announcement of the end of the Korean War will bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is cautious in confirming the prediction without Pyongyang first taking decisive action to disarm it.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second meeting.
But there is general doubt that Pyongyang is serious about giving up weapons, which the country sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare everything for Kim and Trump’s second meeting.
At fashion magazines in Paris unveiled the latest line of huge covers coming to stores with affordable brands near you
If you want to complement your collection of covers or completely hide from the sun, you do not need to look ahead.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a collection of weird oversized covers in their spring and summer 2019 collections on the fashion runway, which has blinded style at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical covers flooded Instagram this summer, and the designer sent his spectacular creations to the fashion runway.
Valentine's piece, which stood out the most, was a beige hat with wide laces decorated with feather-like accessories, in which the heads of the models were completely lost.
Other oversized fashion accessories included precious stone watermelons, a magic hat, and even pineapple – but your heads won’t warm up.
Thom Browne also showed a selection of bizarre masks – just the right time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks have stitched lips and are more similar to Hannibal Lecter masks than high fashion.
One creation was similar to the equipment for diving with a breather and glasses, and the other looked like a cornet with melted ice cream.
And if you want to follow fashion, you are in luck.
Fashion connoisseurs predict that giant blankets will come to the stores near you.
Wide hats closely follow “La Bombi”, straw hat with 60-centimeter laces were noticed on Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski, among others.
A cult brand for extremely impractical hats, which flooded social networks, sent another great creation along the fashion runway – a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model in the swimsuits she wore.
The raffia bag in burnished orange, bordered by raffles in raffia and a white leather handle, was the central piece of Jacquemus’ Spring/Summer 2019 La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famed fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to arrive in stores next summer – because the designer made such a strong impression, it would be hard to ignore the demand for too many accessories.”
John Edward: Knowledge of languages is crucial for global citizens
Scottish independent schools enjoy a reputation for academic excellence and this continued in 2018 with another series of outstanding exam results, further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of service to their students and their parents.
Independent schools want to prepare their students for further and higher education, a chosen career path and a place they have as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we see that modern languages are still a popular and desirable elective subject in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the conversation is imprinted on his memory.
But if you talk to a man in his mother tongue, the words are imprinted in his heart.”
This is a good reminder that we should not rely solely on English when we want to establish relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s results from recent exams show that languages are at the top of the rankings with the highest levels of achievement in independent schools.
68% of students who have studied a foreign language have achieved excellent grades.
Data collected in 74 schools of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) showed that 72 per cent of students achieved an excellent score in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of students of German, 69 per cent of students of French and 63 per cent of students of Spanish had an excellent score.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as the key knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are treated as an elective subject in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere in the same way as subjects in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Training Commission found that 17 per cent of the reasons employers are struggling to fill their jobs can be attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, knowledge of languages is becoming increasingly necessary in preparing young people for their future career path.
For future job opportunities that require language skills, these skills are essential in the global world.
If someone learns a different language, regardless of the career path he chooses, with such lifelong knowledge, he has a great advantage in the future.
A multilingual person, who can communicate directly with people from foreign countries, has an automatic advantage over the competition.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK found that 75 percent of people didn’t speak a foreign language well enough to be able to speak, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of respondents, that’s 15 percent.
Therefore, investing in language learning is important for today’s children.
With the knowledge of several languages, especially those from countries with a developing economy, children have a better chance of finding a suitable job.
In Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important to the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the interests of your child, in independent schools it will always be possible to choose a number of languages taught by experts in this field.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare and equip children with the knowledge they need to succeed, no matter what the future brings.
In the global business environment, it cannot be denied that languages remain extremely important for the future of the country, and this must also be expressed in education.
In fact, modern languages should be treated as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will make his Lakers debut in San Diego on Sunday.
For fans looking forward to LeBron James’ first appearance for the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait will be over soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opening game of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
He doesn’t know how many minutes he’ll play.
“More than one and less than 48,” Walton explained on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers official Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games before the season.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need games before the season to prepare,” he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia on YouTube
President Donald Trump today in Wheeling, West Virginia, begins a series of rallies in his campaign.
This is the first of Trump’s five planned congresses next week, including stops in his favored states, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
Since his candidacy for the job in the Supreme Court has not yet been confirmed, Trump wants to win support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are threatened with losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time will Trump’s rally be in West Virginia and where will he be able to watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place on Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7 p.m.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia live online on YouTube.
Trump is likely to talk about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings this week, which have become tense over allegations of sexual misconduct, prompting confirmation in the Senate to be delayed by a week for the FBI to conduct an investigation.
But the primary goal of this series of congresses is to help Republicans, who are waiting for important elections in November, gain new momentum.
That is why President Trump’s campaign aimed at “promoting volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority they have in the Senate and the House of Representatives,” Reuters reports.
“Congressional oversight is so important to his program that the president will travel to as many countries as possible during the busy campaign season,” a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
According to West Virginia MetroNews, supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could also attend today’s rally at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, which would attract interest from the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia for the second time in the last month, where he received more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in public opinion polls.
“There’s a bad sign for Morrisey that the president should come and ‘lift him up’ in public opinion polls,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team still yearns for victory and keeps hope ahead of Sunday's individual duels
After three one-sided games, maybe Saturday’s two-two-foursome was just what Ryder’s Cup needed.
The swing swing is a completely invented sports concept, but the players really believe in it, especially in such competitions.
So where has it gone now?
“They had six points and now they have four, so it’s probably a new start for us,” Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, because it leads by four points, and twelve more can get them.
But according to Spieth, Americans feel that they have the wind in their sails, in addition to being stimulated by the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each won three points out of four.
Spieth was fatal from the initial blow to the green and sets a good example.
The screams of happiness continued to grow louder and led to a decisive blow when Thomas was left behind with two points equalized in the fourth game.
The blow that brought them victory at the 15th hole was accompanied by a similar scream, one that lets you know that you believe the American team still has a chance.
“You just have to find your inner strength and focus on your game,” Spieth said.
That’s all that’s left for these players.
18 holes to glory.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas have in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of Ryder's Cup.
Unusual, but charming, two of Europe have won four points out of four and are inescapable.
The two Molliwoods were the only ones who didn’t hit a bug on Saturday afternoon, and the bugs were avoided on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the last nine holes on Friday morning.
Such a game and the way in which the energy is obviously flowing between them and the noisy audience, confirm the fact that they are the ones who will have to beat them on Sunday, and no other player could better seal any victory of Europe than Fleetwood or Molinari, the son of the National bocce.
If possible, both at the same time on different holes.
But talking about European glory would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the morning hero in the four-ball game, who was paired with Alex Noren.
Due to a bug and two double bugs in the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swedish fell into a crisis from which they could not find a way out.
The players will not be able to help on Saturday.
Games with four balls and a duel of two pairs is an exception interesting to watch closely due to the communication between couples, the advice they give each other, the advice they do not give each other, and the way in which the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has so far played better than the team and has a lot of advantage over the last day, but the two-match matches have shown that the US team also has a desire to win, which some, especially on the American side, doubted.
Europe leads 10:6 ahead of last day of Ryder Cup
Europe goes into the final day of Ryder's Cup with a nice advantage after leading 10:6 against the US after Saturday's four-ball games and two-match duel.
An excellent pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari gave their all and with two wins over Tiger Woods and four points on the Le Golf National course.
European team Thomas Bjorn, who is trying to win the trophy she lost to Hazeltine two years ago, had a lead over the American team that made a mistake in the morning games with four balls and led in the series with 3:1.
The U.S. team resisted better in the two-match duel, where they won two games, but were unable to make up for the loss.
Jim Fury's team needs eight points from a week's 12 individual duels to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four straight points, while Molinari (the pair were called “Molliwood”) is only the second pair to win four points in their first four games in Ryder Cup history after a sensational weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in a four-ball game, they turned out again and more convincingly defeated the exhausted Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled through two games on Saturday, showed his brilliance at times, but lost 19 of 29 games in four-ball duels and two-ball duels, seven of them in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning four-ball game, returned for the two-two duels and, paired with Henrik Stenson, defeated Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koeopko 2 and 1 respectively, placing first and third on the world rankings.
But on a pleasant, windy day in the southwestern part of Paris, not everything went according to the plans of the team of Europe.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a new benchmark for Americans with two points on Saturday.
With 2 and 1 they won decisively against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a four-ball game and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy with 4 and 3 in the duels of two matches, losing the first two holes.
Only once in the history of Ryder's Cup did the team return after a four-point lag before the individual duels, although Fury's team only needs a draw to retain the trophy.
But after two days in second place, Sunday’s counterattack may seem too much of a snack for her.
North Korea: “Without trust, we will not unilaterally disarm”
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued implementation of the sanctions is causing growing mistrust in the United States and that under such conditions North Korea will certainly not unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Jong Ho, at the annual meeting of the General Assembly of this world body, said that North Korea had taken a number of “significant measures in the past year in the name of goodwill” such as halting nuclear and missile tests, undermining the site for nuclear tests, and making no promises of nuclear weapons.
“We don’t see a proper response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, we will not be confident in national security, and under such conditions, we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a gradual approach to nuclear disarmament, under which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual action, his statement was significant because he did not immediately reject the unilateral refusal to do so.
Ri cited a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump from the first summit between the current U.S. president and the North Korean leader held in Singapore on June 12. At the time, Kim pledged to strive for “nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump assured the North Korean side of caution.
North Korea wants an official end to the Korean War, which took place between 1950 and 1953, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also not given up on calls for the release of the strict international sanctions that apply to North Korea.
“The U.S. insists that we must first denuclearize, and it is stepping up the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goals by force, and it is even objecting to the declaration of an end to the war,” Ri said.
“Thinking that sanctions could bring us to our knees is an unrealistic hope for people who don’t even know us.
The problem, however, is that the further implementation of sanctions further deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that the US president outlined at the United Nations General Assembly earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in that have taken place over the past five months, adding: “If we were to talk about the nuclear disarmament problem with South Korea and not with the United States, the nuclear disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not be dead.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was completely different from that of last year, when the United Nations General Assembly said that an attack on the mainland of the United States with North Korean missiles was inevitable, after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, at the United Nations General Assembly praised Kim and his courage in taking disarmament measures, but said there was still a lot of work to do and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is overthrown.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time frame for this, saying, “It can take two years, three years, or five months — it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia are of the opinion that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must resolutely continue without exception until we recognize the full, final and verified state of nuclear disarmament.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously adopted additional sanctions on North Korea to prevent the financing of North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Russia on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit did not end well.
When he left Pyongyang in July, he said progress had been made, and North Korea had already criticised him for saying his demands were “gangster.”
North Korea pledged at a meeting with Moon earlier this month that it would demolish a missile test station and nuclear test infrastructure if the United States took “appropriate action.”
Mr Moon said the "appropriate measures" meant the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and measures to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard University students attend a course where they learn how to take enough time to rest
The goal of this year’s new course at Harvard University is for all undergraduate students to learn how to afford more sleep. With such a course, they want to fight against the growing masculinity culture of “full-time” learning, in which the powers are built up with caffeine.
A university professor has found that students at the world’s best universities often don’t know the basics about caring for themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Women's Hospital, designed the course, which is the first of its kind in the United States.
To carry out such a course, he decided after his lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on learning.
At the end of the lecture, a girl approached him and said, “Why do I only know this now that I’m in my last year?”
She said no one had told her how important sleep was, and the professor told The Daily Telegraph that he was surprised.
The course, which is being conducted for the first time this year, talks about the key importance of good sleep habits for study and sports success as well as for improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the University’s health services, says they decided to take such a course when they found that the student was significantly lacking in sleep during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is a picture of the door of the student home, where students can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports shoes and books to get information on the impact of caffeine and light, the impact of lack of sleep on sports success and the importance of sleep routine.
In the second section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The map of the student settlement with interactive icons of the participants encourages you to think about their daily routine.
“We know that students’ behavior will not change immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know these facts, just as they have the right to know how their health is affected by cigarette smoking,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The professor says that a culture of pride is still present in “surviving all-night learning”. He also adds that modern technology and the growing pressure on students, as a result of which lack of sleep, represent growing problems.
Professor Czeisler says that a sufficient amount of quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” of students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety. Thus, they can also avoid gaining weight – the brain, due to lack of sleep, goes into a mode of hunger, which makes them lazy.
19-year-old California student of chemical and physical biology Raymond So helped Professor Czeisler design the course. Last year, during his first year at Harvard, he attended one of the professor’s lectures.
He says that the lecture opened his eyes and encouraged him to carry out the course throughout the student settlement.
He hopes that in the next phase, postgraduate students will be able to ask to complete a similar study program before enrolling in a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set their alarm clock to sleep as well as to wake up. He also wants to warn them of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, as they can cause an imbalance in the circadian rhythm, which is what makes it so.
Livingston : Rangers = 1 : 0 Menga with a hit submerged the river Gerrard's team
Rangers again defeated in the away draw: Dolly Menga in Livingston announced the team of Steven Gerrard sentenced to defeat with 1 : 0.
The Ibrox team chased their first away win after a 4–1 victory at St. Johnstone Stadium in February, but Gary Holt's second loss in 18 games since Gerrard led the Scottish League top-scoring team to 8 points.
Menga attacked seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the selected type of Rangers did not give the impression that he wanted to equalize.
With this, the Rangers fell to the frequent spot, and Livingston advanced to third place, but with the difference of goals, the Hibernian team was left behind.
Calum Spence, a side-judge, suffered a head injury when, after reporting it, an object landed from the fans' guest team.
Gerrard made eight changes in the crew, who easily beat Ayr and qualified for the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt held on to Livingston’s proven elevens, who had taken a point away from Hearts a week earlier, and was undoubtedly excited about how his fledgling team effectively neutralized all guest attempts.
The Rangers had a higher possession of the ball, but Livingston took better advantage of it.
The first opportunity came two minutes after the start when Menga found Scott Pittman with the first short pass, who then went on to score Allan McGregor, but the vesist was inaccurate in the performance and missed the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs' long free-kick was then scored by Captain Craig Halkett, but the balls were then missed by his defensive assistant Alan Lithgow.
In the final third, the Rangers took control, but the game showed more hope than a real desire to win.
Alfredo Morelos was quite confident that a penalty shot would have to be awarded after a 15-minute match with Steven Lawless, but Judge Steven Thomson's request was thwarted by the Colombian.
The Rangers were only able to score two goals in the first half, but no head shots sent by Lassana Coulibaly against the goal, nor the foggy ball by Ovie Ejari, did not pose any danger to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Livingston's opening goal in the 34th minute may have surprised everyone, but he was already well-deserved for persistence.
The Rangers failed to cash in another Jacobs sequel with a long pass.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher brought the ball to Scott Robinson, who routinely prepared Mengi's pitch for an easy end to the attack.
Gerrard took action and replaced Coulibaly with winger Ryan Kent during the break, who immediately turned out to be handing over Morelos, but Kelly effectively ran out of his lines and blocked the attack.
However, Livingstone continued in his style and forced the guests into his game, with Lithgow and Halkett taking care of several passes before the goal.
Holt's team could have increased the lead by the end of the game, but McGregor effectively neutralized Jacobs, and then Lithgow was inaccurate after the corner.
At the Rangers, Glenn Middleton was given the option of a penalty shot at the end of the game after contact with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson did not recognize him.
Almanah: Inventor of the Geiger counter
We present a page from the almanac of our Sunday editions: on September 30, 1882, that is to say, on this day more than 136 years ago, Johannes Wilhelm “Hans” Geiger was born in Germany, who later became a world-renowned physicist.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, this invention was the basis for the development of a device called the Geiger counter.
This became a fixture in the scientific world, and it also gained its place in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans play cowboy scientists:
Man: “What the hell is that?”
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter. It’s used to look for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can really hear the effect that radioactivity has on atoms in materials.”
Evans: “Madonna, they’re really announcing it now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention with his name lives on.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to recognize attack cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to recognize and destroy attacking cells
The vaccine as part of the therapy teaches the immune system to recognize the attacking cells
This method involves obtaining the patient's immune cells, which are then modified in the laboratory.
After that, they can “see” the protein that is characteristic of many forms of cancer, then they are returned to the patient.
The results of the trial vaccine are very encouraging in patients with very different cancers.
In one of the women who received the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize the attacking cells, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
This method involves obtaining the patient’s immune cells, which they change in the laboratory to “see” the HER2 protein, which is characteristic of many forms of cancer, and then injecting them again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Research Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of several different cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancers.
A similar approach to acquiring immune cells from patients who are “learned” to target cancer cells has also worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West performed a pro-Trump point with the inscription MAGA on the cape after his performance at SNL.
The audience was not impressed.
Kanye West was punched in the studio by Saturday Night Live after a bizarre point, during which he expressed support for US President Donald Trump, and also said that 2020 will be a presidential race.
After finishing his performance with the third song of his performance, called "Ghost Town", during which he wore a cap with the inscription "Make America Great Again", West began attacking the Democrats and once again expressed his support for Trump.
“It often happens that I talk to a white person and they say, ‘How can you like Trump because he’s a racist?’
“Well, if I was worried about racism, I should have moved out of America a long time ago,” he says.
This time the SNL show began with a parody with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood actor delved into the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which Christine Blasey Ford accused of sexual assault.
The video of West's monologue was not played, but was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock was going to make a joke out of West.
West also complained to the audience, among other things, that he had some problems in the background due to the inscription on the cape.
“They came to me behind the scenes.
They said to me, ‘Don’t walk or walk.’
I was harassed!
But they say I’m lost,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see a lost scene?” and added that he had to put on “Superman’s cloak, because that means no one can command me. Do you want the world to move forward?
Try it with love.”
His comments prepared the audience to whistle at least twice, and members of the SNL team were obviously embarrassed, and someone told Vanity: “There was a dead silence in the studio.”
West was invited to a goat swap at the last minute for Ariano Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West was already amazed by the video for the song "I Love It", where he wore a Perrier mineral water bottle costume.
Westa was backed by Candace Turner, head of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: “One of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing up for heaven.”
The show’s host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is simply “what it is, and that’s fine.
However, I will NOT reward someone (by buying his music, clothing or supporting his “art”) who, in my opinion, welcomes and spreads an ideology that is harmful to our community.
He's free.
“Me too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and would henceforth be "a being formally known as Kanye West.
Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy, was not the first musician to change his name.
His roommate Snoop Dogg once called himself Snoop Lion, but we can't forget another musical legend: Prince changed his name to a symbol, and then he was an Artist, once known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder for stabbing a person in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident took place in Ballyhackamor.
The defendant is due to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
Star of the Game of Thrones Kit Harington has taken a strong stand against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's exciting medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor, who has strongly condemned the stereotype of a macho hero, says that due to the appearance of such roles on screens, young boys often feel that respect can only be earned with tenacity.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture magazine that something went wrong in his opinion, and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the period of the #JazTudi movement.
The actor, who recently married 31-year-old Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, has admitted that he has strong beliefs about the topic.
“Personally, at the moment, I’m seriously wondering where we made a mistake when it comes to masculinity,” he said.
“When we were growing up, what did we teach men about the problems we now face?”
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity by portraying very male characters.
He continued: “What is natural and what is learned?
What do we learn on television and on the streets that young boys feel they have to choose exactly this particular side of masculinity?
I think one of the important questions of our time is how can we change that?
“There was something wrong with the young people.”
In an interview, he also said that after the end of the series next summer, he will not participate in the filming of any prequel or sequel to the Game of Thrones, because he has “finished with battlefields and horses.”
In November, Kit will play the lead role in the new True West production of Sam Shepard, a story about a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The player recently revealed that the best thing that happened because of the Game of Thrones is that he met his wife Rose on the set.
“Because of this series, I met my wife, so she kind of gave me my future family and my life from here on out,” he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character Jon Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 on the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people have been affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, around 40,000 new cases were reported.
In the vast majority of new cases, the disease has been transmitted through sexual intercourse, representing a change from the past.
Usually, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusion of infected blood.
However, according to Chinese health officials, according to a conference in Yunan province, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has decreased to almost zero.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is still increasing by 100,000 per year.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a very pressing problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still very much present.
Since conservative values still apply in the country, according to research results, 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry a woman.
The disease is often tolerated due to inadequate protection in sexual relations in such relationships.
Since 2003, as part of efforts to address the problem, the Chinese government has promised universal access to medicines to treat HIV.
Maxine Waters denies that staff have released data on Republican senators, condemns “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff posted information about three U.S. Republican senators on their Wikipedia website.
The Los Angeles Democrat has claimed that these allegations come from individuals and websites of the far-right.
“Lies, lies and more untouchable lies,” Waters wrote in a statement on Twitter.
The information released includes the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
This information appeared online on Thursday, released by an unknown person from Capitol Hill, during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual harassment of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators ended up questioning Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState state that the IP address can be used to identify the source of a post that was allegedly linked to Senator Waters' office and to conclude that the information was published by one of the staff, Hill said.
“These unsubstantiated allegations are completely false and outright lies,” Waters continued.
“My employees, whose identity, personal data and security are compromised by these false accusations, are in no way responsible for the leak of this data.
These unsubstantiated accusations are completely untrue and a pure lie.”
Senator Waters' statement quickly came under fire online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“Out of this denial comes anger,” wrote Fleischer.
“This may not be the right test for Congress.
When you accuse someone of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t show anger.
He can't resist.
And he must not doubt the motive of the one he accused.
You have to stay calm.”
Fleischer compared Waters's response to the Democratic criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too obviously angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running for Waters’ seat in the midterm elections, responded via Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s serious,” he tweeted.
Waters said in a statement that her cabinet had notified “the relevant institutions and law enforcement agencies regarding these false allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all acts that are harmful and dangerous to every member of my staff and to all of them.”
Johnny English in action again - Rowan Atkinson as a secret agent
The search for hints of Brexit in any new British film has become a tradition, and is also true for the revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which was first released in 2003 under the title Johnny English and continued in 2011 under the title Johnny English 2.
Will it be a fun satire about how lousy we are, a new export opportunity for us?
An incompetent Johnny English with bulging eyes and unusual grimaces gets permission to stir the cheeks again; already his name suggests that this is a comic character created for a cinematic audience in non-English-speaking areas.
Despite his bizarre moves, it contains a piece of Clouseau, a fragment of Mr. Bean, and a trifle of the one who contributed the final note to Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It is also based on a traveler and an international mystery writer who Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten TV commercial for Barclaycard, leaving behind a real mess.
In the latest film, one or two pleasant moments are presented.
I liked it when Johnny English was approaching in a helicopter, wearing a medieval armor, and the rotor blades were briefly touching at his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for comedy is clearly displayed, but humor seems a little mild and overly unnecessary, especially since "serious" films like 007 or Mission Impossible now offer comic elements without a bad conscience.
It seems that humor is meant for children and not so much for adult viewers, which is why for me the repulsive adventures of Johnny English are not as innovative and directed as Atkinson’s silent sketches in the role of Mr Bean.
The constant theme is now obvious that the UK is in serious trouble.
The online hacker has infiltrated the online network of Britain’s most secretive agents and revealed the identities of all British agents, causing great trouble to the competent agent, represented in a surprisingly small role by Kevin Eldon.
This is the turning point for the Prime Minister, a pompous figure who has already experienced a breakdown due to political disapproval: Emma Thompson has tried to play the role of the alleged Teresa May, but there is nothing tangible in the script that could help her.
The intelligence service informs her that all active spies have been exposed, so she must opt for one of the retired spies.
And that means Johnny English, now a teacher at a reputable school who unofficially teaches how to operate undercover: here the writers hit, as English performs some sort of spy “rock academy”.
The Englishman is taken to Whitehall for an emergency meeting, where he meets a longtime collaborator, Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to the submarine commander, a stereotypical sports enthusiast, a role in which Vicki Pepperdine gets a little lost.
So Batman and Robin are ready to create even more problems in the name of the secret service of her Highness, while they meet the fatal Ophelio Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
In the meantime, the prime minister is dangerously under the influence of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: this is the evil Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey: dressed as a waiter, they set fire to a French restaurant, create chaos as it overheats on the roof of Volta's yacht, and when English tries to use glasses for apparent reality to get to know the interior of Volta's house as he sleeps.
Although the last part contains all the necessary ingredients, despite the cuteness and energy it resembles a children's film.
Very average.
Like other Johnny English films, I can’t help but wonder: is the British film Atkinson capable of giving a role that actually justifies his talent?
Labour denies that they are planning a four-day work week for the British, with a five-day work week payment.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is considering a radical plan where Britons would work four days a week and receive a five-day paycheck.
The party of business leaders wants the savings that companies create because of the artificial intelligence revolution to spill over to workers and give them an extra day off.
This way, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend with the same high salary.
Sources say the idea fits with the party’s economic plan and plans for the state to side with the workers.
Trade unions are supporting the transition to a four-day work week, as this is a way for workers to reap the benefits of a changing economy.
A Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "The policy review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-week workday is the goal we will strive to achieve with a client’s approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the overall industrial strategy of the client.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the four-week working week in its campaign in the 2017 general election was supported by the Green Party.
This is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A representative of the Labour Party said: “The four-week workweek is not a party policy and the party does not think about it.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour conference last week to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to extract power from “reckless CEOs” and “winners” in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies may not regain their full share, as a Labour party could impose “deductions” on the basis of alleged culpability.
It also approved plans to include workers on boards of directors and the introduction of equity funds, transferring 10 per cent of the stake in private companies to employees who would receive annual dividends of up to GBP 500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy discussed whether their views could be changed by the FBI’s Kavanaugh investigation.
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether the findings of any Republican senator’s office could persuade him to withdraw his support.
In an interview aired on Sunday, a reporter for Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham’s “60 Minutes” program asked if the FBI could discover anything that would change its mind.
Kennedy seemed more open to this than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“Before the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
When I called him when this accusation came up, I asked him, ‘Did you do that?’”
He was determined, unwavering, unwavering.”
Graham's voice seems to be carved in stone.
“I created my own opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and would need an extremely compelling reason to change it,” he said.
“I don’t know what happened to Dr. Ford, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of those whom she had appointed could confirm this.
The case is 36 years old.
I don’t see any new changes.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it in any way contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizens Festival, an annual music event attended by a truly exceptional variety of stars and with the same outstanding mission: to end poverty in the world.
The festival, which will be held this week, will be attended by tens of thousands of people. They will occupy the Great Trail of Central Park not only to enjoy the performances of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to arouse interest in the true purpose of the event, i.e. the 20th anniversary of the event.
The Global Citizens Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Citizens Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, a letter to the world leader, a phone call, or any other sensible way to raise awareness of their goal of leaving.
How successful is the Global Citizen movement, which has 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the right way to convince them that they need action, or is it just another example of so-called “clicktivism” – creating the belief that people actually have a significant impact on the situation by signing an online petition or tweeting?
The Global Citizen movement states that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” of its supporters in the pursuit of a variety of goals.
He says these actions have helped global leaders make more than $37 billion in commitments and policies that are expected to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group stated that the result of its actions was expected to be 390 commitments and messages, on the basis of which at least USD 10 billion had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the funds raised so far have directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of investors and decision-makers committed to “helping children realize their full potential,” which Rwanda has pledged $35 million in aid to help end malnutrition after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global donors.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can put the social culpability of malnutrition into historical archives,” said Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of the Nutrition Power Partnership, at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions that the UK has called for improving the nutrition of mothers and children, the government has announced that it will co-finance the Nutrition Power project, which will reach 5 million women and children through nutritional measures.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the site, “Why do you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?”,
The Global Citizen movement responded: “This will be a long and hard road – sometimes we will fall and we will fail.
But like the great civil rights movement and the fight against apartheid before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Some of the performers who will perform at this year’s event in New York include Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e. The event will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The United States could use the Navy to “block” Russian energy exports – U.S. Interior Ministry
U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke reportedly told the Washington Examiner that Washington could use the navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy marketing, including in the Middle East.
Zinke said that Russian intervention in Syria (it should be noted that at the invitation of the legitimate government) is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
“I think the reason for their presence in the Middle East is the desire to market energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern part of Europe,” he said.
However, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with this.
“The United States can do this, and the Navy will make sure that our shipping lanes are open and, if necessary, block them, preventing Russian energy from entering the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants at an event hosted by the Energy Consumers’ Union, a nonprofit group that addresses itself as the “voice of energy consumers” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that it is actually the same.
“As far as Iran and Russia are concerned, the economic option is more or less to influence the fuel and replace it,” he said, calling Russia “a pony who knows one trick” with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made at a time when the Trump administration is trying to increase exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe, where it is supposed to oust Russia, which is a significantly cheaper choice for European consumers.
To this end, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to give up the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is said to be the “thief” of Moscow after Trump.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $ 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is supposed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington is violently opposed to the project only for economic reasons and that this is unfair competition.
“In my opinion, we have the same view that energy should not be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
Germany rejected the US position and confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Federation of Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“Interfering a third country in our energy supply is a big problem for me,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industries Association (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will “Exactly Study” Her Nomination for 2020 U.S. Presidential Election, Says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would “examine carefully” her candidacy for president after the midterm elections.
At the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she would be considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a female leader,” she told The Hill.
“After November 6th, I will be studying my candidacy for president in detail.”
At a meeting in the city hall, Warren was playing President Donald Trump, who was supposed to “lead this country in the wrong direction.”
“What Donald Trump is doing to our democracy worries me terribly,” she said.
Warren has been a vocal critic of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course, we need an FBI investigation before the election.”
A poll released on Thursday showed a majority of Warren’s own voters felt that Warren should not be running for president in 2020.
According to a poll by the University of Suffolk’s Political Research Center/Boston Globe magazine, the senator should not run for president, eight-fifty percent of “probable” voters from Massachusetts.
Twenty-three percent would support her candidacy.
The poll showed that the former governor Deval Patrick has more support for his candidacy, with 38 percent of respondents supporting it and 48 percent opposing it.
The other high-ranking Democrats who would run in the 2020 election are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden, according to the Associated Press, said he would make a decision by January.
Sarah Palin at a meeting in support of Donald Trump mentioned post-traumatic stress disorder Track Palin
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he experiences after his return, connects me to other families dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and a certain degree of injury with which our troops are returning,” he told the audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described her son’s arrest as “an elephant in the saloon” and said her son and other war veterans were returning slightly altered, hardened, wondering where the respect for what the soldiers and airmen and all other members of the military had given to the state was.
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence with assaulting a woman, obstruction of family reporting, and possession of a weapon in a guilty state, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla police station.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the rejection of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal repudiation of a new U.S. policy that denies victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence the right to asylum.
NBC News reported that representatives from 18 countries and the aforementioned district filled the courtroom on Friday to support the legal dismissal of the policy.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy, has not been released.
She said her partner and “his violent sons, members of the gang,” abused her, but on July 20, U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors of the states that support Grace are Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which numerous asylum applications come to the U.S., described as countries that are constantly grappling with problems with gangs and domestic violence.
In 2014, a new U.S. asylum policy overturned a decision by the Committee on Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "disrespects decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum claims be assessed on the basis of the individual facts and circumstances of the claim, and this prohibition violates this principle,” the court said in a statement.
In the request, prosecutors said the policy, which denies immigrants the right to enter, harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “provide the necessary labor.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to grant more asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear associated with race, religion, nationality or membership in an individual social group or political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 policy release.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems, even the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
The death toll in Palu has doubled, but desperate rescue efforts are underway to find the survivors.
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
“The feeling is very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforted her hot boyfriend at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Saviors are constantly bringing in corpses.
“There is a lack of clean water.”
It seemed that the townspeople, returning to the destroyed homes, were breaking through exaggerated things and trying to find anything useful.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were destroyed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, were overloaded.
Some of the injured, including Dwij Haris, who suffered injuries to his back and shoulder, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were treated outdoors due to the constant strong aftershocks.
When he remembered the violent earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, in which he lived with his wife and daughter, his eyes filled with tears.
“There was no time to get out.
I think it pushed me against the ruins of the walls,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that he was in town with his family because of the wedding.
“I heard a woman calling for help, and then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of ‘Insults’ with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after the publication of a four-page ad for an official Chinese newspaper in a U.S. newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of abusing the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last week mentioned a paid supplement to the China Daily in the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after China accused it of meddling in the Nov. 6 U.S. congressional election, which China denies.
Reuters reported that U.S. federal officials described Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. federal election as a new phase in Washington’s increasingly intense effort to pressure China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in an increasingly intense trade war, in which they exchange blows by imposing tariffs on imported products.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war are expected to hurt exporters in states such as Iowa that support the Trump Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, the main exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in a column in Sunday’s edition of the Des Moines Register, “now doubles this harassment by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading the propaganda, the Chinese government has used the cherished American tradition of free speech and free press to publish a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“On the other hand, you will see few other opinions on the stands of Beijing newspapers and no real reflections of the diversity of opinions held by Chinese citizens about China’s worrying economic path, as the Communist Party of China is strictly in control,” he wrote.
He added that “one of the most important Chinese newspapers rejected the offer to publish” his article, although he did not specify which one.
Republicans lose seats ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh break-up, analysts warn
Analysts point out that the support of many of the most important Republicans who support and advocate for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, despite several allegations of sexual assault, will be known in the upcoming midterm elections with the loss of voters.
The sentiments here are extremely high, and most Republicans have already said they want to proceed with the vote.
This cannot be put back,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Maxwell’s University in Syracuse, said in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher said he doubted that pressure from Senator Jeff Flake to investigate the FBI at the last minute would be enough to appease angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget it tomorrow, and they won’t forget it in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative for MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” as they demonstrated in the Senate aisle as Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee decided to continue supporting Kavanaugh’s nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Mic news portal reported.
“The Democrats’ enthusiasm and motivation will cross all borders,” Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told reporters.
“People say they’re strong now, and that’s true.
But it could be even stronger, especially among unspecified voters in the suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29 who don’t like the president, but don’t vote often.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault of a Supreme Court candidate, analysts said further Republican support could have negative consequences.
“This has become a big mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, the former president of the Republican National Council, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about voting for the world or the final vote or Kavanaugh’s oath; it’s also about how Republicans deal with Republicans and how they treated Ford,” said Guy Cecil, director of the US-based group Priorities, which supports Democrats in the election.
Americans, on the other hand, seem somewhat divided between, or more likely to believe, Ford's or Kavanaugh's testimony, with slightly more supporting the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or most believe in Ford’s testimony, and 35 percent said they certainly or most believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh was probably or certainly lying while testifying, and only 30 percent said that about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBA is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had attacked her when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her genitals when they were together at a party during their studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the world wide web plans to launch a new internet to deal with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, is opening a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technological legend, Inrupt, is a company building on Berners’ open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt’s purpose was “to rule the world.”
“We’ve decided to do it now,” he said of the new company.
“It’s a historic moment.”
The application uses Solid platform technology, which allows users to create a “personal data storage” or POD
This may include contact information, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s similar as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were all available in one browser at a time.
The peculiarity of a personal storage of data is that the user can fully determine who can access what information.
The company calls this “personal data re-enforcement.”
CEO John Bruce says the company’s vision is to bring together the resources, processes and relevant skills that will enable access to the Solid platform for everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few hired developers to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Already this week, technology developers around the world could use the tools available on Inrupt’s website to create their own decentralized applications.
Berners-Lee said he and the group “do not talk to Facebook and Google about whether they could introduce a complete change that could end all of their business models overnight.”
“We don’t ask them for permission.”
In a Saturday post on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s goal is “to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over internet neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the Victoria Cross from the First World War
In their home town, for 100 years, they have been celebrating the award of the Victoria Cross to the only priest of the English Church who earned it as a fighter in the First World War.
Honorable Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann earned his recognition on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
But four days later he was shot by a sniper, so he never found out that he had been awarded this highest British military honor.
On Saturday, at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, two of the colonel's grandsons discovered a memorial stone.
One of the great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s deed, which earned him the distinction.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the St. Quintin Canal "through a very dense fog and under a strong fire of battlefields and machine guns."
Later, he made his way towards the firing line and, with “the greatest heroism,” led the line forward, then attacked the machine gun itself and hit three members of the squad.
On 4 October 2018, just a good month before the end of the war, Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was shot by a German sniper.
Michael Vann, 72, said the old father’s actions were “something I know and could never achieve, so teach me humility.”
After a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band, Dr. James Vann and his brother put on a wreath.
Michael Vann said that he felt “very honored to be able to participate in this parade,” and that “the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that many people will express.”
Fans of mixed martial arts watched all night to watch the Bellator 206. Instead, they were in favor of Puja Pepa.
Imagine: All night long you’ve been watching the fully sold out Bellator 206, then you can’t see the main event.
The event in San Jose included 13 duels, including six on the main floor, and was broadcast live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to confront each other, viewers in the United Kingdom were startled to find that the broadcast had been replaced by a performance of Puys Pep's cartoon.
Nobody was very excited, as he stayed up until the morning just because of the duel.
One of the fans on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as "some kind of sick joke".
“According to the government regulation, this content was inappropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to a children’s program,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the transfer.
"Pep's piece. Yes."
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said they were trying to adjust the schedule so that viewers in the UK would be included in the future.
“When I think about replaying, I think we could fix that,” Coker said.
“However, it is six o’clock in the morning on Sunday and we will not be able to arrange this until the week after our time or the Monday after theirs.
But we're working on it.
Trust me, there were a lot of messages exchanged during the switch and not everyone was friendly.
We tried to fix the issue; we assumed it was just a technical error.
However, the actual reason was a government regulation.
I can promise you this won't happen again next time.
Instead of six, we’re going to have to endure five duels – as usual. We’ve tried to offer fans more than we expected, and we’ve kept that in mind.
It’s a very ungrateful situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt “undervalued” about sex.
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he felt inferior to anyone because of his sexual orientation – but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he realized that “not everyone is like himself” when he entered high school.
Speaking on the first episode of Desert Island Discs, which was directed by Lauren Laverne for Radio 4, he said he spoke about gay rights to give others “hope”.
He also said that as he became a parent, his desire to win the Olympics diminished.
The regular host of the long-running show, Kirsty Young, was absent for several months due to illness.
Daley, who appeared as an outcast on Laverne’s first show, said he felt “less valuable” than everyone else because “it wasn’t socially acceptable to love boys and girls.”
He said: “To this day, these feelings of inferiority and difference are a real thing that gives me the strength and perseverance to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, that he would not disappoint anyone who would finally find out about his orientation.
The two-time bronze Olympic champion has become an influential advocate for LGBT rights and has appeared twice this year at the Commonwealth of Nations Games in Australia to call on countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt happy that he could speak openly without consequences, and that he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said that his romance with a man — the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — “surprised him.”
Daley married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older than him last year, but says the difference in years has never been a problem.
“When you’re so young” – at the age of 14 he took part in the first Olympic Games, and three years later his father died – he said it’s hard to find someone of the same age to experience similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted a child in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley's son, and Daley says that changed his "whole view."
“If you asked me last year, all I had to say was, ‘I have to get a gold medal,’” he said.
“Yet, you know, there are bigger things in the world than the Olympic gold medal.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as Daley's father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would have to die, and one of the last things he asked about was whether he already had tickets for London 2012 as he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn’t tell him, “This time you won’t be in the first place, Dad,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only when he actually stopped breathing and was dead did I finally have to admit that he wasn’t invulnerable,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I knew this was what I had been dreaming of all my life – to dive in front of the home crowd at the Olympics. There was no better feeling,” he said.
This was also the inspiration for his first song selection, “The Current” by musician Heather Small, which she accompanied in the preparations for the Olympic Games, and at which his skin is still tanned.
The show Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 a.m. (BST).
Mickelson misses Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but will have to get back in shape again so it doesn’t become an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who will participate in the biennial event for a record 12 times, let Captain Furyk sit at Saturday's fours.
Instead of being at the center of events as was so often the case for the United States, the five-time winner spent the day partly as a fan and partly improving his game to fix what he was trying to do.
Given that even at the peak of his career he did not measure the most straight, the 48-year-old does not match the best narrow course of Le Golf National, where long ice inevitably punishes missed shots.
And if just the pitch wasn’t scary enough, Mickelson will face the exact winner of the British Open Cup on Sunday, Francesca Molinari, who has linked up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood this week in a jump to victory in all four games.
If the Americans, who have four fewer games at the start of 12 individual games, started well, Mickelson’s game could prove decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but he did not say much.
“He fully understands the role he played today, patted me on the back and hugged me with his hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is one of the famous and has contributed immensely to the teams in the past and also this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I imagined more, but it turned out that way, and we thought it had to be done that way.
He wants to play, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will break Nick Fald's record for the most games in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of Ryder's Cup career, which never really matched the height of his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, but Furyk said his presence in the team also brings some unacceptable benefits.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make people crazy, and it’s great to have him in the team,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had fun when they moved in with him this week, which was fun to see.”
It’s much more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big advantage can soon be achieved
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that an important advantage at the start of the last day of individual games in the Ryder Cup can easily be turned into an unpleasant ride.
The young Dane made his debut in 1997 at a match in Valderrama, where the side captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, breaking through the goal with a hair-only lead with a score of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“Don’t forget that we had a lot of advantage in Valderrama; we had a lot of advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but hardly,” Bjorn said (pictured) after a look at the Class of 2018 team, which won 5-3 on Friday and yesterday and led the National with a 10-0 lead.
History shows me and everyone in the team that the Cup is not over yet.
Play full tomorrow.
Go and do whatever it takes.
The game isn't over until it's written on the board.
We have a goal to win this cup, and we need to stay focused on that.
He has always said that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are also well aware of who is on the opposite side – the best players in the world.”
Enthusiastic about his players’ play on the demanding pitch, Bjorn added: “I would never rush there.
Tomorrow will be a different day.
Tomorrow will be in the forefront of the game of individuals, so this will have to be dealt with differently.
It’s nice to have a partner when things are going well, but when you’re there alone, your golfing skills are tested to the end.
This is the message you need to convey to the players: You need to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now leave your partner behind and he too must get the best out of himself.”
Unlike Bjorn, Jim Furyk will encourage his players to play better than they played as a partner, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of the turnaround on the last day, as he was part of the winning team at Brookline before ending up as a loser when Europe performed the “Miracle in Medina”.
“I remember every damn word,” he replied, when asked how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, led his players on the final day of the game.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we would like to start as fast as we saw in Brookline as we saw in Medina.
When this drive gets the stamina, it puts a lot of pressure on the mid-games.
We created the right layout and put the guys in a way that we felt we were going to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas was assigned to try and fight Rory McIlroy in the best game, and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter will be the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
“With this group of guys, I’ve chosen this order because I think it covers the entire schedule,” Bjorn said of the individuals’ choice.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
The latest frigate of the German navy should be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging warships from the Cold War, but it will not be until at least next year due to the breakdown of systems and rapidly rising costs, local authorities reported.
The surrender of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the leading ship of the new class of frigate Baden-Wuerttemberg, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, says the Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military representative.
The ship is expected to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project is plagued by worrying post-delivery issues.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships, commissioned in 2007, will replace the ageing Bremen-class frigate class.
It is expected to have a strong cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and some concealment technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer maintenance intervals – the latest frigates are expected to remain outside the home port for up to two years.
But the continuing delays mean that high-end warships, which are supposed to allow Germany to exert its influence overseas, will become obsolete by the time they start to be used, the Die Ziet newspaper notes.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
That was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, and the German authorities have cited a number of key “programmatic and technical shortcomings” that would render the warship useless if it were sent on a combat mission.
The shortcomings of the software were particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors – only half the workforce on older Bremen-class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is very heavy, which reduces its capacity and limits the Navy's options for its future upgrade.
The 7000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz is said to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to the lack of equipment, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – has also become a problem.
This is expected to reach a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion) – up from an initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming particularly important in light of recent warnings that the naval power of Germany is diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Parliament’s defence committee, admitted that the navy was indeed “lacking ships suitable for deployment.”
The official said the issue eventually escalated as the old ships were decommissioned and replacement vessels were not provided.
He regretted that no Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ship could join the navy.
The National Trust eavesdrops on the secret life of bats
At the Scottish Highlands estate, a new study is underway in which they are trying to find out how bats use their diet in food hunting.
They hope that the results will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
In the study, scientists from the National Trust for Scotland (NTS) will monitor small bats and small bats as well as brown-tailed bats and peripheral bats at the Inverewe Gardens estate in the Wester Ross area.
At the key locations of the estate, they will set up special recorders to monitor bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research using hand-held detectors.
Professional audio analysis of all the recordings will confirm the frequency of calls of bats and what types they do.
They will then draw up a habitat map and report to create a detailed picture of their behavior across the landscape.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most suitable for bats and how each species uses them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of grasslands and the conservation of forests for bats and other related species.
The number of bat populations in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects shelters and habitat loss.
The risk is also represented by wind turbines and lighting, as well as flywheels and some types of chemical treatment of building materials, as well as attacks of domestic cats.
In fact, bats are not blind.
Because of their nocturnal hunting habits, they are more likely to help each other with their ears than with their eyes.
To accurately determine faults and obstacles along the way of the flight, they use a sophisticated technique of echolocation.
NTS, which is responsible for the supply of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land per country, takes bats very seriously.
It employs ten experts who regularly carry out research, inspections of shelters and occasional rescues.
The organization established the first and so far the only Scottish reserve, specifically dedicated to bats, on the Threave estate in the Dumfries and Galloway area.
The estate manager David Thompson says the estate is an ideal territory for them.
“There’s a great area for bats on Threava,” he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of ancient trees and all quality habitat.
However, much is still known about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to succeed.”
He stressed the importance of checking the presence of bats before carrying out maintenance work on the property, as the possible unintentional destruction of a single bat nursery can cause the death of up to 400 females and cubs, which can mean the collapse of the entire local population.
The bats are protected, so it is forbidden to kill, harass or disturb them, and it is also forbidden to destroy their obstetrics.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Nettle Conservation Fund, encouraged the public to participate.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many species we simply don’t know how well their populations are holding up.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges, Lawyers Prepare for German Magazine's Lawsuit
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations he allegedly committed “fake news” and said people want to “promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus strikers were accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Der Spiegel said on Friday that he would then pay her $375,000 to keep quiet about the event.
Speaking to 142 million followers in an Instagram Live video several hours after the report, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports “fake news”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said was fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“By using my name, they want to promote themselves.
That's normal.
By mentioning my name, they want to become famous, which is part of the work I do.
I’m a happy man and I wish everyone well,” the actor added with a smile.
Ronald’s lawyers, according to Reuters, are preparing to sue Der Spiegel magazine for charges they called “unacceptable reporting of suspicions about private life.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “improperty damages in an amount commensurate with the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
In the documentation filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada, she was said to have returned to the player’s room after meeting with Ronaldo at the Mayorga nightclub, and he allegedly raped her there.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the event and told her that he was “99 percent a good man” who only disappoints in “one percent.”
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed the sexual relationship, but described it as consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she referred herself to the police and that photographs of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “terribly afraid of revenge” and was concerned about “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old says she wants to cancel the settlement because she continues to have severe trauma due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was at the time of the alleged attack just before his move from Real Madrid to Manchester United, but this summer he moved to the Italian giant Juventus on a $100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would regret forever' the loss of automakers
The UK “would regret it forever” if it were to lose its status as the world’s leading carmaker after Brexit, business secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that Britain's withdrawal from the EU without a deal would temporarily halt production at a factory in Burnastone, near Derby.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese carmaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston factory – which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models – produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I believe that if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal at the end of March, production at our factory would stop,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at the Burnaston plant.
Concerns about how a no-deal exit from the European Union will affect cross-border trade have also been voiced by other car manufacturers in the UK, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers call the risks associated with the supply chain, in the case of Brexit.
Toyota’s production line operates on the “right time” principle, with parts from UK and EU suppliers for custom cars arriving every 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, this could lead to border disruptions, which industry representatives say could lead to stalemate and shortages of parts.
Toyota would not be able to store parts for more than a day at its factory in Derbyshire, the company’s representatives said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely moderated to avoid such border checks".
“We want to reach the best deal that will allow us, as I say, not only to enjoy the current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The data of not only Toyota but also of other manufacturers is that we need to be absolutely able to continue a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota could not comment on how long production would be halted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the factory’s competitiveness and ultimately lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston factory for 24 years and is the founder of Unite’s union in the factory, said his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, a lost job never comes back.”
The government representative said: “We need to present an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, White House says
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “suspended for another week” because of the ongoing battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who studies Russian pre-election meddling, the connections between Trump associates and Russia, and the potential president’s obstruction of the judiciary.
The question of whether Trump will fire the attorney general’s envoy and threaten Mueller’s independence has been fueling Washington’s rumours for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about using a wiretap to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, he visited the White House, amid reports that he plans to step down.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, which was then held at the United Nations conference in New York, was declared Thursday.
Trump said he would “prefer not to forgive” Rosenstein, and the meeting was then moved to avoid conflict by a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of inappropriate sexual behavior, Dr. Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “The date hasn’t been set yet. It could have happened this week, given everything else that’s going on in the Supreme Court, but it could have been postponed for another week.
We’ll see. I always want to make sure you’re informed.”
Sanders hasn't called a meeting of the White House with reporters since September 10th, and he's been in the White House ever since.
The show's host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the rarities of the meetings are not to be attributed to the resistance to “setting up” TV reporters, but she said: “I couldn’t deny that they were being set up.”
Then she mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president is holding more press conferences than any president before him,” she said, adding without citing a source: “We looked at the numbers.”
“If journalists can address the president of the United States directly with their question, it’s infinitely better than discussing it with me,” Sanders said.
We’re trying to make this happen as much as possible and you’ve seen that we’ve done this a lot over the last few weeks and that you’re going to have a conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting statesmen.
Independent press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, when he appeared outspoken and in part bizarre to gathered journalists.
Letter from the Minister of Health to EU workers at NHS Scotland on Brexit-related fears
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff working on the Scottish NHS to express the country’s gratitude and the desire to continue work after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, an SME, sent the letter less than six months before the UK’s exit from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying the costs of applications for the regulation of the status of EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on withdrawal continued as decisions were coming closer this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this must be a time of great concern for all of you.
That is why I would like to stress once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his nationality.
Colleagues from across the European Union and non-member countries bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health sector and benefit the patients and communities we provide.
In Scotland you can feel completely at home. We really want to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie Urgently Operated After Head Injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie suffered an emergency surgery following a head injury in a 31:27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, according to Mike Organ of The Tennesseean.
The head coach of the Tennessee State University told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
“He came to the edge of the pitch and he kind of collapsed there,” Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen at the edge of the court before putting him on stretchers and taking him off the court for further examination.
A Tennessee State University official told Chris Harris of the WSMV channel in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie is recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “the details of the type/range of injury are not yet known” and that Tennessee State University is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, who is currently a freshman at the university, is playing for Tennessee State University for the first time since graduating from the University of Illinois.
On Saturday, he suffered a total of five strokes before coming out of the game, bringing his total number of strokes in the season to 18.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax when buying a property in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, and additional money will be used to help homeless people according to the new plans of the Tories.
The move will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s efforts to attract young voters
The increased lump sum will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher rate of co-payment when buying real estate in the United Kingdom, and the money raised will go to the homeless, Theresa May said today.
The move should be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn’s successful efforts to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable housing and higher taxation of high-income people.
The increased cot will be charged to individuals and businesses that do not pay tax in the UK, and the extra money will boost the government’s efforts to eliminate homelessness.
The premium – which will be charged in addition to the current lump sum, including the increased levels introduced two years ago for other homes and broadcasting properties – could amount to no less than three percent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year through the introduction of the measure.
It is estimated that non-citizens in the UK would buy 13 per cent of newly built London properties, resulting in higher prices and a more difficult purchase of the first property.
Many rich areas of the country – especially in the capital city – have become “spirit cities” as the number of buyers who spend most of their time outside the country increases.
The new policy was only adopted a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the amount of cologne to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
The big construction company has accused the price hikes of grabbing land that they don’t actually use, and Mrs. Mayeva has called for the abandonment of affordable housing quotas to fix Britain’s “residential shame.”
Mr Corbyn announced an attractive series of proposed housing reforms, including rent control and ending forced evictions without errors.
In addition, it wants to give city councils greater powers to build new homes.
Mrs Mayeva said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my first leadership to the renewal of British dreams – that life must be better for every new generation.
This also means the correction of our non-functioning housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and create a life here.
However, it cannot be right that for people who do not live in the UK, and for foreign companies, buying a home is as easy as for garage British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of their own home is far too distant, and the humiliation of homelessness remains far too real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to run Scotland’s club’
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “final goal” is to one day become the manager of Scotland.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which currently holds third place in the First League, with three points less than the top-ranked.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren back to the Scottish Championship in the final season.
“I wanted to play for my country as an actor.
I got the B cap and that was it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sportsound.
“I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden as a child, so it was always something that pulled me back.
This opportunity would only be offered to me if I were successful in running the club.”
Ross' predecessors at the helm of Sunderland were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic team boss, who had previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town, says that as a successor to such big names, he felt no fear.
"Success for me is measured by the question, 'Can I take this club back to the Premier League?'"
In terms of structure and performance, this club undoubtedly belongs to the First League,” he said.
“It’s not an easy road to get there, but it would probably be a success if the club could go there again.”
Ross served as a manager for only three years after being an assistant manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month part of the Hearts coaching staff.
Alloi then helped prevent a tie-break in the third league, and St Mirren led the side to the championship title the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever while playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real breakthrough,” recalled Alloe’s takeover.
“I was really convinced that management was the right thing for me, much more than just playing.
It’s funny because I did well as an actor, I had a relatively good time with it and I also achieved some major successes.
But the game can be challenging.
You have to deal with a lot of things every week.
I still struggle with this in terms of stress and pressure at work, but management simply feels like the right thing to do.

The summer heat has increased the revenue of hard-hitting British pubs, but the pressure on restaurant chains has also increased.
Pub and bar groups increased sales by 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenues declined by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, CGA business advisor who prepared the data, said: “England’s sustained sunshine and participation in the World Cup, which lasted longer than expected, meant that July followed a similar pattern to June last month when pub revenue rose by only 2.8 percent.
The drop in restaurant traffic by 1.8 percent in June was even higher in July.
Traffic in pubs and bars with drinks increased in comparison to each other more than traffic in restaurants decreased.
Due to the sunny weather, sales also decreased in pubs, which mainly offer food, but not as dramatically as in restaurant operators.
It seems that people simply wanted to go for a drink.
In different pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 per cent in one month, and food sales decreased by three per cent.”
Paul Newman from RSM’s leisure and hospitality analyst group said: “These results continue the trend we’ve been seeing since the end of April.
When selling on the hospitality market, the biggest factors remain the weather and the impact of major social or sporting events.
It is not surprising that groups of restaurants continue to struggle, although a fall of 4.8 percent on a year-on-year basis will be particularly painful due to ongoing cost pressures.
For the owners of the food establishments, a long hot summer could not come at a more inappropriate time, and only time will tell whether the necessary recovery will bring the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August.”
Total sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, were 2.7 per cent in July, indicating a slowdown in the introduction of brands.

One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 years old – have a secret social media account they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the growth of fake Instagram pages
The news has heightened fears about the publication of sex-related content
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main” account for their parents.
One in five children – some as young as 11 – create an account on social media that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 students showed the rapid growth of fake Instagram accounts.
The news has heightened fears about the publication of sex-related content.
Twenty percent of students said they run a censored “main” account that they show to their parents, but they also have private accounts.
A mother who happened to stumble upon the secret site of a 13-year-old daughter noticed that the daughter was inviting visitors to rape her.
A survey conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Conference of Directors and Directors (HMC) of Independent Schools found that 40 percent of 11-18-year-olds have two profiles, half of whom admit to having a private account.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are being tempted to create an online space where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the voice of athletes on the Scottish Athletics Committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as the non-executive director of the Board's Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most distinguished athlete on and off the field and President Ian Beattie has described this move as a great opportunity for those who direct sport to take advantage of her extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has a lot of respect for the Scottish, British and global athletics community, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland would gain a lot from its inclusion on the board,” said Beattie.
Doyle said: “I’m thrilled to be able to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won a total of four Olympic medals in running at 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, has been left speechless after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I can recover and to what extent.
Work was hard, but I fully recovered, learned to walk again, and today I am practicing agility exercises!
Thank you for all the encouraging messages!”
An ad for a breast pump that compares mothers to cows has divided online opinions
The company that manufactures breast pumps has shared opinions with an ad that compares mothers with cows at the mill.
To kick off the “first silent portable breast pump” marketing, consumer technology company Elvie has released a provocative music video ad designed to show mothers all the freedom the device allows.
Four real mothers dance in the company of cows in a haystack, on a song that includes the following text: “Yes, I draw myself, but no tail appears,” and “If you haven’t noticed, it’s not my tits, it’s my tits.”
The chorus continues: “Exhaust, exhaust, feed the babies, exhaust, exhaust, squeeze the breasts.”
But the ad, which was posted on Facebook’s website, caused considerable outrage online.
At 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it was a joke at the expense of the “horrible” dairy industry.
“The use of cows to advertise this product is a very poor decision.
Like me, they get pregnant and breastfeed to produce milk, but their babies are already being stolen in the first few days after birth,” one wrote.
Breast pump Elvie discreetly fits into breast pump (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: “Of course it’s traumatic for both the mother and the cub.
But why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who keep their children?”
Someone else added: “An ad completely without feeling.”
Others praised the ad, with one of the women admitting that she found the song "for fucking funny".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would buy it if I was still breastfeeding.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping.
The ad is a little crazy, but I understood it as intended.
“It’s a great product,” wrote another.
Someone commented: “It’s a funny ad that targets moms who exhaust their milk (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like cows.”
This is not an ad that praises or condemns the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women reveals that they danced with hidden pumps in a bra.
The concept of action is that many women who suck their breasts say they feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly fits into a nursing bra, allowing women to move, hold a baby and even do outdoor activities while pumping milk.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD in mothers, further commented: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative presentation.”
With the push of the parallel between women pumping milk and dairy cows, we wanted to focus attention on milk pumping and all its challenges, while at the same time, in a fun way that women can connect, show an incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has come to the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two walked the model trail for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Silently Moved to Texas Border Camp
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply, even though the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult for children to be handed over to sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors of undocumented migrants are afraid that asking for a child would jeopardize their own chances of staying in the country.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other household members would have to hand over fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested several dozen people who had requested to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of these are punished foreigners.
That is why we are continuing to search for these individuals,” said Mr. Albence.
In order to treat children faster, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of being detained, and not after 60 days, which was the previous standard, shelter workers said.
Many will appear with a video conference call and not in person to defend themselves before an immigration judge.
Those who are deemed not to be eligible for assistance will be quickly expelled.
The longer the children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to refugee workers and reports that have emerged in the system in recent months.
Advocates said that these concerns are greater in larger institutions, such as Tornilla, where signs of child distress due to their size are more likely to go unnoticed.
They added that moving children to the tent city, without emotionally preparing them for it or giving them a chance to speak from friends, could complicate the trauma that many of them face.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In an address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces on Syrian soil are illegal, under the guise of fighting terrorism, and will “comply with them.”
“They must immediately and unconditionally withdraw,” he told the assembly.
Moualem said the “war on terror” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions have had to leave their homes, “almost finished.”
He said Damascus would continue to “fight this holy battle until we clear the Syrian territory” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United Nations has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the territory of this war-torn country.
Regarding refugees, Moualem said the conditions were suitable for them to return, accusing “some Western countries” of “spreading unreasonable fears” that convinced refugees to stay abroad.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to contribute to their easier return,” he said.
“They are turning into a political issue, which should be an exclusively humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned Syria that it will not receive reconstruction funds until Assad and the opposition reach an agreement on ending the war.
United Nations diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold, Idlib, has created an opportunity for political talks to continue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province home to three million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement has a “clear deadline” and expressed hope that the military intervention would be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al Qaeda, who “will be eradicated”.
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first session of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to prepare a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election.
Moualem defined the terms of the Syrian government’s participation in the committee, saying the committee’s work should be limited to “reviewing the articles of the current constitution,” and warned against meddling.
Why will Trump get a second term?
After this conclusion, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 re-election unless, as many liberal viewers are likely to hope, his presidency ends prematurely with interpellation and scandal.
Which would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential final ever!”
So far, there are no signs of fatigue for viewers.
Since 2014, CNN’s viewing has more than doubled to 1.05 million at its peak, and MSNBC’s viewing has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its highest viewing time, according to Nielsen, more than four years ago, when it had 1.7 million, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has reached the highest number of cable customers with 3.5 million new viewers at night.
“It’s a fire that attracts people because it’s something we don’t understand,” Neal Baer, the director of the drama “Designated Survivor,” said of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a well-known comedian and author of “Just Funny Things: And Some Hard Truths About Spying at the Hollywood Boys Club,” offers a different interpretation.
Remember the taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why, she asked.
“He said, ‘Because it makes me laugh,’” she told him.
In chaos, there is fun value.
Of course, contrary to what can be seen on television, the story from Washington could decide the future of the Roe v. Wade case depending on whether immigrant families can reunite and the health of the global economy.
The off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Still, a six-hour look at a round table of experts discussing the use of a source “from a deep background” for Bob Woodward’s book “Fear,” $15,000 worth of jackets made of new leather (“clothes, thickly lined with puff,” said The Washington Post) and the aftermath of the shocks.
Sam, for example, I'll never look at Super Maria the same way again.
“The part of his doing that gives the impression of a reality show is that he offers something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars about the cast of Trump’s show and the daily twists of the script (a duel with N.F.L. Jong, praised).

When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, it was a sunny 80 degrees (26.7°C), but he was puzzled inside watching MSNBC while filming CNN.
There was no way he could tear himself apart, even when Brett Kavanaugh faced a Senate committee and the future of the Supreme Court hung in the air.
“I remember making all these crazy shows back then, and people were saying, ‘This is the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was a joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Foreign money runs out in preparation for the tightest midterm elections
It is not surprising that in the 17th pension district, they notice a flood of money, because due to the reorganization of congressional districts, two candidates found themselves in the race for the same seat.
This recently redistributed suburban district of Pittsburgh is home to Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in this spring’s special election in another district.
Lamb competes with fellow Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which heavily overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn when a Pennsylvania Supreme Court judge ruled in January that old districts were unconstitutionally redrawn in favor of Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district touched the battle to fund the campaign between the main party financial bodies, the Congressional Committee on Democratic Campaigns (DCCC) and the National Republican Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widely-accompanied March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
This seat was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators attribute a slight advantage to the Democrats.
In the United States, they were considering sanctions against Salvador because of China’s support, then withdrew.
Diplomats have found that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the leadership of the Trump Organization.
Foreign Ministry officials have decided to call off U.S. heads of diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama amid “recent decisions to end recognition of Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, the ministry’s spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were being considered for El Salvador, which is estimated to receive $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including aid to combat drug trafficking, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included restrictions on financial assistance and targeted restrictions on visa issuance, would severely affect this Central American country with high unemployment and a high number of murders.
During the internal meetings, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic development to continue a similar meeting last year, which was assessed as a step forward in the prevention of migration in the United States.
By mid-September, however, top government officials had clarified that they wanted the conference to continue, concluding discussions on penalties for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now in charge of addressing attendees of the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the importance the U.S. government attributes to the meeting, the diplomats added.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to the conversation on condition of anonymity.
Their testimony was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Historical Comparisons
The next unpleasant news could be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on possible obstruction of the judiciary, which is already very much in the public records.
Mr. Mueller is also expected to direct the investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s campaign cooperated with Russia in attacking the U.S. election.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to answer before the authorities, and perhaps even before a jury of his colleagues, just as he prepares to address his constituents again.
There are many questions, and I do not want to argue that Mr Trump’s downfall is inevitable, nor are his peers in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we will have to make decisions that will affect how long the fight can last.
In 1938, German officials were ready to strike against Hitler if the West opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich.
We failed, thus missing the opportunity to avoid the year of slaughter that followed.
At these turning points, the course of history is changing and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerating or slowing down.
Americans are facing several such setbacks right now.
What will we do if Mr. Trump pardons Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mueller’s investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in the thick of it ever since this officer reported that last year he proposed a secret recording of the president and speculated about his inadequacy for the position.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times's report was incorrect.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s required investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not exhaustive or fair, or if he is appointed Supreme Court Justice despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congress that will demand Mr. Trump’s responsibility?
If we fail in these tests, a long winter of democracy awaits.
But I'm sure we won't fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she ordered me to light the Sabbath candles on the swastika table.

Ranger Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, making it clear that a win over Austria after an impressive draw against Villarreal in Spain will put them in a convincing position for qualifying from the European League Group G earlier this month.
The knee injury prevented tie-breaker Graham Dorrans from appearing for the first time in the season ahead of a 2:2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use it as a springboard for bigger achievements.
“This was a deserved point for us, as Villarreal is a strong team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We came into the game in the belief that we can achieve something and take the point.
You might be able to win in the end, but overall the draw is probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we showed up and we were a better side in the second half.
There will be another big European night on Thursday.
We hope that we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure with the crowd behind us that we can try and achieve a positive result.
The last year has undoubtedly been difficult, given everything that has happened, including injuries and changes at the club itself, but I have a good feeling about this place now.
The team is good and the guys really enjoy it; the training is good.
I hope that we can continue now, leave the last season behind us and achieve success.”
Poor sleep for women due to fear of savings
Despite the fact that the respondents had a clear idea of how to care for them, few people talk about it with their family members.
Half of Nationwide’s survey respondents said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
“People want a family member to care for them, but they don’t bother to talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
You can start as follows.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare a family to care for you if you don’t talk to them about it in time.
Talk to your counselor and family about where and how you want to receive care, as this can be an important factor in cost assessment.
Include a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these costs.
Your choice of long-term care financing may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a combination of cash value and a life insurance policy to cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own funds, if you can afford it.
Prepare the necessary legal documents: Prepare for legal battles at the crossing.
Choose a health representative by identifying a trusted person who will oversee your health care and ensuring that experts will take your health wishes into account if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider authorizing a person for your finances.
Choose a trustworthy person who will make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills will be paid if you are not able to do it yourself.

Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the number of casualties is expected to rise further.
With communications cut off, rescuers from the Donggal regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the 7.5-magnitude earthquake epicenter, were unable to obtain any information.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in Palu after the earthquake.
Some key facts about Palu and Donggali in Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, a province that lies at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi and is estimated to have a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a province stretching along more than 300 km (180 mi) of the coast to the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative unit under the province, had an estimated population of 299,000 in 2017.
The main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi Province are aquaculture and farming, especially in the central region of Donggala.
In the province, nickel mining is also an important activity, but most of it takes place in Morovali, on the opposite side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggalo have been hit several times by tsunamis over the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Natural Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
In 1996, the tsunami also affected the northern Donggalo and caused the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia sits on a seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, so earthquakes occur regularly here.
In recent years, some major earthquakes and tsunamis have been as follows:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A type of strong earthquake struck western Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that flooded its southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands and triggered a tsunami up to 10 meters high that destroyed dozens of villages and caused the deaths of about 300 people.
2016: The sinking of the earthquake affected the reign of Pidie Jay in Aceh and caused death and panic when people remembered the deadly earthquake and tsunami in 2004.
This time the tsunami did not start, but the collapsed buildings caused the deaths of more than 100 people.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily detained thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Tracka Palina, the eldest son of former governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
A 29-year-old man from Wasilla, Alaska, has been arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and resisting arrest, the Alaska State Troopers police agency said on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin’s acquaintances, when she tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, took the phone out of his hands.
Palina was detained at the Predkasen Mat-Su facility and is in custody under an unsecured $500 guarantee, KTUU television network reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself “certainly innocent” when asked about his defense, the network reported.
Palina has been charged with three Class A offences, meaning he could be jailed for up to one year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with one class B felony, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
Palin's crime wasn't charged for the first time.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was accused of domestic violence, interference in the reporting of domestic violence and possession of weapons in an alcoholic state in connection with the event.
Palin's girlfriend said he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veteran groups in 2016 when she linked her son’s violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder after returning from military service in Iraq.
Tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been shut down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off central Sulawesi, which lies northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
There are videos circulating on social media showing the moment of the earthquake.
When the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people stayed at the beach festival in the city of Palu.
U.S. Attorneys Seek Rare Death Penalty for Suspected New York Terrorist Attack
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in a New York terror attack that killed eight people, a rare punishment that has not been carried out for federal crime in the country since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly used a rented delivery truck to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan when he drove more pedestrians and cyclists in October.
In order to justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm, according to a notice of the death penalty request filed in the Southern District of New York.
According to the court document, the reason for the death penalty may be any of the charges.
Several weeks after the attack, Saipov’s grand jury briefed him on a 22-point indictment that included eight counts of extortion-assistance murder commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as a charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack called for “significant planning and collusion,” prosecutors said, describing Saipov’s method as “disgusting, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drak, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandra Damian Pagnu.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The District Court for the Southern District handed down the last death sentence ten years ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers and was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty in New York City in a federal case was last handed out in 1953 to Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were executed for conspiring to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed on the electric table on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, has shown no regrets in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he felt good about what he had done.
After the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by videos of ISIS, which he watched on his phone.
Police also said they had demanded the unveiling of the ISIS flag in their hospital room.
With respect to the 22 charges, he pleaded not guilty.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was “clearly disappointed” by the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt in exchange for life in prison without the possibility of release for all those involved will only prolong the suffering associated with these events,” Patton said.
Saip's defense team has previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of Brexit negotiations, says Tory MP
Nigel Farage, during a protest at a conference of the Tories, promised to "mobilize the people's army".
The former Ukip leader said politicians must “feel the heat” of Eurosceptics when one of May’s own MPs suggested that she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said on a campaign trip to Birmingham that the UK would “be out now” if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But the challenge faced by Mrs Mayeva in harmonising her deeply divided species was also highlighted by the Tories, who favoured Brexit waivers, who joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her plan in check amid attacks by Brexit advocates, Brexit opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that Mayeva would try to reach an agreement in Brussels despite the opposition and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and the “chaos”.
Mr. Bone is at the Leave Means Leave conference in Solihull that he “want to get rid of Chequers.”
He said that we should appoint Mr Farage as our interlocutor and give him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was in charge, we’d be out by now,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
He described his opposition to the EU in the following words: “In the world wars, we did not fight to be servants now.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected proposals that have changed public opinion since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to stay in the EU is completely untrue.”
The meeting was also attended by the Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who told the rapporteurs: “I simply say: ‘Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers plan is not popular with the general public and the opposition will not vote for it, but it is also unpopular with our party and our activists, who are active on the streets and lead us to an election in general.
Please drop the Chequers and start listening.”
In a message addressed to Mrs Mayeve, she added: “Premiers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said at the meeting that politicians should be given “feel the heat” if they intend to issue a decision taken in a 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to issue a Brexit, and today we’re going to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you do that.’”
In a statement to the crowd, he added: “I want you to give our political class, which is on the verge of Brexit, a feeling of warmth.”
“We are mobilising the people’s army of this country, which has secured our victory in Brexit, and we will not rest until we become an independent, autonomous, proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, the Remainers walked through Birmingham, where they then had a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved the Tories’ flags against Brexit this weekend after the group was founded.
The Labour nobleman Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for security concerns about using the party app after the conference opened.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can set up IT systems and all the technology to deal with Canada plus plus, for a border without stops, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
“This is a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren's claim to the presidency will be "examined."
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “examine participation in the presidential race” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future at a meeting with citizens in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is often critical of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 election campaign in Massachusetts.
He is at the center of speculation that he could face Trump in 2020.
The event in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the form of a “town hall” since Trump became president.
One of the participants asked her if she intended to run for president.
Warren said, “It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government, which requires a woman at the top.”
Arrest after the death of LSU player Sims in the shooting
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that they had arrested a suspect in the shooting of LSU basketball player Wayda Sims.
The Baton Rouge police station is reporting the arrest of 20-year-old Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of Friday's shooting and asked for help identifying the man in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed early on Friday near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and eventually died,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul said in a statement.
Wayde intervened to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted at the hearing that he was at the scene, that he had a gun, and that he shot Wayda Sims.
The Simpsons were arrested without hesitation and taken into custody to the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 198-centimeter youth who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games in the last season with 10 starts, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of the world champion, and the team has ordered him to leave the victory to Sebastian Vettl
On Saturday, the moment Valtteri Boltas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it became clear that “Mercedes’ team will have a strong impact on the race.”
Bottas got off to a good start and almost left Hamilton on dry ground when he defended his position in the first two laps and invited Vettl to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to drive into boxing and let Hamilton drive on the tail of traffic, which should have been decisive.
Mercedes led him into boxing later and left him behind Vettl, but Hamilton noticed after some driving action that the Ferrari driver’s displeasure leaves the inside open and risks falling behind in the third corner after two defensive moves.
Max Verstappen started with the last row of the grid and was seventh until the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then most of the car race was without a tire change, as he intended to make a quick finish, overtake Kimi Raikkonen and take fourth place.
He finally led in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could not increase the speed, so Raikkonen occupied the fourth place.
It's a tough day, because Valtteri was driving fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he left me behind.
“The team has done a tremendous job to get first and second place,” Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump on Saturday mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein for her insistence on not disclosing letters from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly touch Ford’s testimony before a Senate inquiry, but instead said that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “wicked, corrupt and false.”
“The only beautiful thing that can happen and that has happened in the Senate in the last few days is that we can see the anger when you can see that people are evil, corrupt and false,” he said.
“When you look at publications and revelations, people say, ‘No, I didn’t do that.’”
I didn't do that."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you reveal that?
Remember her answer...you revealed the document – ‘Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t reveal it.”
All right, hold on a second.
We revealed it to us ... No, we didn’t,” he added regarding the senator’s impression.
Ford sent a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and it was revealed to the media in early September — but Feinstein denies it came from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I did not disclose her letter,” Feinstein told the commission.
“She asked for my confidentiality and I kept it confidential as she asked.”
Her denial obviously did not suit the president, who said at a meeting on Saturday night: “I tell you, it was a really bad body language.
It may not be true, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In defense of a Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president hinted that Democrats are abusing the charges for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain their power by all possible means.
You’ve seen the anger, the disgust, they don’t care who they’re hurting and who they’re supposed to be hurting to break through to power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars vs Belfast Giants: 5:3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars made up for Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants with a 5–3 win in Saturday's game at Dundee.
The Giants scored two goals in the early days of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equaled for the home side, and then Dwyer again took the lead for the Giants.
Francois Bouchard equalised for the Dundees before Lundvald Nielsen's two goals gave them a win.
This was the third loss of the season in the Elite League to Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 from behind on Friday night.
This was the fourth match of the season between the teams, with the Giants winning in the previous three games.
Dwyer scored his first goal in the game in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFaul's assist, and Beauvillier, who scored four minutes later, was handed by David Rutherford.
In the intense opening act, Sullivan led the home side again at 13:10, and Matt Marquardt gave Cowney a draw at 15:16.
Dwyer led the Giants on holiday when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first third.
The home side came together again, and Bouchard made up for the remainder with a violent goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead the Dundees to a lead at the end of the second third and secure a win with his team's fifth goal of the half-time and secure a win with his team's fifth goal in the latter half of the third.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at home at Milton Keynes on Friday.
An air traffic controller has killed hundreds of people on a plane to escape an earthquake.
Air traffic controllers in Indonesia are hailed as a hero after he sacrificed his life so that a plane with hundreds of people could safely take off.
More than 800 people died in Friday's earthquake on the island of Sulawesi, which was followed by tsunamis, and many are missing.
The area continues to be shaken by strong aftershocks, and many people are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although the co-workers fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not leave his job in a heavily shimmering control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
It remained within it that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, could safely take off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was going down.
He died later in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian media outlet ABC News reported.
We prepared a helicopter to transport him from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning, even before the helicopter reached Palu.
“Our hearts are broken when we hear that,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could reach several thousand, as the country's disaster relief agency said access to cities in Donggali, Sigi and Boutonga was limited.
“The death toll is expected to rise further as there were many dead bodies under the rubble, but we were unable to reach many,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
Palu, where the mass funeral will take place on Sunday, was devastated by waves up to six meters high.
Military and commercial aircraft provide assistance and care.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a rescue vehicle brings in bodies.
Lack of clean water.
“The mini-markets are everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
On Sunday, Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Pal and addressed the national army: “I ask all of you to work night and day to fulfill all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit by the Lombok earthquake earlier this year, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesian Plane Crash: Air Niugini Now Says One Man Missing After Plane Crash in Lagoon
The airline, which operated the flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says it is missing one man after initially reporting that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the plunging plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing person.
They did not immediately respond to a call for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the waterfront when it tried to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said eight passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday, all of whom were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just off the runway.
Some witnesses said the plane missed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed very low.
“That’s very good,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he, along with other passengers, managed to break through the belt-reaching water to the emergency exits on the plunging plane.
He said the stewardesses panicked and screamed, but he himself suffered minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors who repaired the pier nearby also came to the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
Air Safety Network data shows that 111 people have died in air accidents in Papua New Guinea in the last two decades, but this is the first accident to have happened to Air Niugini.
The analyst determined the time of the night when the woman was burned alive
Prosecutors on Saturday presented their evidence in a retrial to a man who was accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used phone records to determine the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the eve of her death, contradicting his earlier claims, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers's at the time he said he was with a friend Michael Sanford, the police turned to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he wasn't in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, he said he was “lying because [my] truck was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The phone records show that they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls, and contact information from his phone shortly after Chambers' death.
“He wiped her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to present its final arguments on Saturday.
The judge said the trial would be judged by a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
Hiphop trio wants to challenge the negative image of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based group The High Breed claims that hip hop has moved away from its original political and social engagement.
They want to go back to his roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a resurgence in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York City nanny sues couple for firing her over 'racist' message
A New York nanny is suing a couple for discriminating against her after receiving a mis-sent message from a mother who complained that she was “another black.”
The couple denies the racist treatment and compares the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed disappointment in 2016 when, upon the arrival of her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, she found out that she was black.
“NEEEEEEE IS ONE BLACK,” wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending him to her husband, she sent him twice to Mrs. Maurice.
After discovering her slip-up, Plasco-Flaxman, who felt “uncomfortable,” fired Ms. Maurice, saying that her outgoing nanny, who was an African-American, was doing a poor job, so she wants to hire a Filipina.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one day's work, and then Uber sent her home.
Maurice is now seeking compensation from the couple in court, in the amount of $350 per day for a period of six months for the work for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them, you know, there’s no such thing,” she told The Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple responded to accusations of racism by claiming that Maurice's dismissal was reasonable because they feared they would be unable to trust her after the reprimand.
“The woman sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not racist.
We’re not racist,” her husband Joel Plasco told The Post.
“Would you be willing to entrust your children to someone you were rude to, even if it happened by mistake?
Your newborn?
Come on.'
Comparing the lawsuit to “eviction,” Plasco said his wife had given birth to a child just two months ago and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Will you treat someone this way?”
That’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
Although the proceedings before the Court are still ongoing, the Court of Public Opinion quickly condemned a couple on social media for their behaviour and way of thinking.
Publishers of Paddington Bear Stories Feared Readers Won't Connect With a Talking Bear, New Letter Revealed
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read the book before it was published.
It’s really fun to find out now that Paddington has become a huge hit.”
She said her father, who initially worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired to write a children's book about a little bear toy, would be outraged by the rejection of his work, adding that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book was "bitter-sweet".
Regarding Paddington, whom she described as “a very important member of our family,” she said that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
“He was the kind of man who didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“Although the Paddington bear was so real to him, it was almost as if your child had achieved something: You are proud of him, even if you don’t really do it yourself.
I think the success of the Paddington Bear was looked at in a similar way.
Although it was his idea and his imagination, he always attributed the success to the bear Paddington himself.”
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, her daughter was taken to Louis Pasteur Hospital 2 in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad regularly called to say that she felt really bad, that she didn’t expect this to happen,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got Nada’s call, and he told me she was going to die in the next two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be at your place.
The drugs given to her by doctors to keep her heart pumping were slowly absorbed and left her system.
She had been dying for some time and that was the end of her life.
All I had to do was sit back and wait, knowing this was all happening.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was in a position where my family and people surrounded me.
I really had to endure.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan Laperouse, who has already mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers unaware of the trial she is undergoing.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I had my head down and tears were running down my face all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but on the plane I felt this strong feeling of compassion for Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Remorseful woman glues posters to prevent suicides on bridge
Two women who have lost a loved one to suicide try to discourage others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys on the Welsh Bridge are pasting posters with inspirational messages and phone numbers that people can turn to for support.
Ms. Tyler's son was 13 years old when he fell into depression, and he killed himself at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up every room.”
However, he stopped working before his death because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, then 11 years old, was the one who found a sibling when he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis said: “I’m constantly worried about the domino effect being triggered.”
Ms. Davis made the posters “to let other people know that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t sit in silence – you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who had been Davies' friend for several years, lost Marka, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother's death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was completely on the floor; when the children opened the presents, he did not make eye contact with them or anything like that.”
She said that his death was a severe trauma for them, but they had to rework it: “She saw a hole in the whole family.
She ripped us apart.
We have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the air at the start of FBI investigation
“I thought that if we could actually do what he asked for – after a limited investigation of the duration and scope – that might unify us,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the world would “break apart” due to a stalemate in the party.
Why don't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican backers want an FBI investigation?
Their resistance is due to the time at which the investigation would take place.
The November 6 midterm elections are just five weeks away – if Republicans cut back badly, as expected, they will be greatly weakened in an attempt to elect the desired man to the nation’s highest court.
George W. Bush has repeatedly telephoned senators to lobby for the support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Mr. Bush and was introduced by him to his current wife Ashley, who is now Bush’s personal secretary.
What will happen when the FBI prepares a report?
The Senate, currently composed of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will hold a vote.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can collect at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would bring Mike Pence, the vice president, a break from the post and election to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean refugees has fallen below Kim.
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Unification, said 1,127 people had fled last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said the key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China, and an increase in the price demanded by people smugglers.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly on this yet.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea finally offer South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them escape through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily secured demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South – which are technically still at war – have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused on stalled denuclearization negotiations.
This came after a June historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they generally agreed on the pursuit of a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho attributed the US sanctions to a halt since then.
“Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm,” Ri said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a “hysterical” and said he was not fit for the job at the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a “hysterical” and said he was “characteristically unfit” for the job at the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can think of no other way than to label a woman as ‘hysterical’ if she behaves this way,” Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate’s Investigative Committee commented on Pelosi.
Kavanaugh has strongly denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In the opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional, occasionally almost screaming and suffocating himself when discussing his family and high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats in the commission and called the accusations against him a “grotesque and coordinated smear” organized by liberals, angry that Hillary Clinton lost in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he should not be appointed as a Supreme Court justice because it showed he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think he discredited himself by making statements like that and the way he dealt with the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi is asked if she will try to bring a constitutional charge against Kavanaugh if it is upheld and the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives, for a moment.
“I will say this: if Congress or the FBI does not tell the truth, it is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where it is now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington.
Pelosi said she was concerned as a Democrat about Kavanaugh's possible decision against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade case, as she is considered a conservative judge.
In his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh evaded the question of whether to overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“Now is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say, ‘Isn’t this wonderful?’” she said.
And the woman must be whipped.
It is a righteous outpouring, after months and years of pouring out of anger, and can not express it without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“It’s not rare, what do you think?”
She continued: “A woman who was a director somewhere helped me a lot, who also cried when she was angry, but she developed a technique, and when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘I may be sorry.
I'm angry."
And then she just continued.
I thought it was top-notch.”
Tears are allowed as a way out of anger in part because people misunderstand them.
One of the most powerful memories of my early career, when I was still working in an office dominated by men, where I once found myself crying in unspeakable rage, was the event when an elderly woman grabbed me by the neck – a cold leader, who I was always a little scared of.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They won’t understand that you’re angry.
They’ll think you’re sad, and they’ll be glad they touched you.”
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, has collaborated with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught jumping over a fence in a boat called Monkey Business and had to get out of the game, Mr. Schroeder deeply felt that there was no reason why she could not run for president on her own.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me in a laugh 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race and one more was the last thing needed at the time.
Someone called the game “Snowflake and the Seven Dwarfs.”
With the latter joining the campaign, she was lagging behind in fundraising, so she decided not to enter the game unless she raised $2 million.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she announced in a conversation that she would not launch an official campaign, her emotions — gratitude to the people who supported her, dissatisfaction with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and focus on voters instead of delegates, and anger over sexism — so overwhelmed her that she began to suffocate.
“You’d think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalled.
“You’d think my official sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my tombstone.
‘Did she cry?’
How the U.S.-China War Could Benefit Beijing
The initial salvos of the U.S.-China trade war have been deafening, and although the battle has long since ended, experts say the split between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, first triggered the warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese export items, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has retaliated every time with equivalent retaliatory measures, most recently with tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China, the world’s second-largest economy, has pledged to keep an eye on the U.S. and is unlikely to blink any time soon.
In order for Washington to give in, China would have to agree to his demands, but the U.S. public removal of Chinese President Xi Jinping would be too shameful.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing knows how to make the right moves, US trade war pressures could have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would trigger an economic upheaval in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than observers have thought so far,” said Abigail Grace, an expert associate who focuses on protecting Asian men.
Syria 'ready' to return refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and asks for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Valid Al Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer because of the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
Now all the conditions are met for refugees to return voluntarily to the country, who had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures directed against their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the rebels.
Europe has won the Ryder Cup in Paris.
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 at Le Golf National in Paris, France.
The U.S. has now lost on European soil six times in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to win over the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems through most of the championship, at the 16th hole in the par-3 game in his initial stroke, locked the ball in the water, due to which he had to hand the game over to Frances Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined through all the rounds and became one of four players who ever since the start of the championship in the current form in 1979 have achieved a score of 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spieth beat the lowest-ranked European player, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, 5 and 4.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played in the Ryder Cup last time.
Veteran of the eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European player of all time with 25.5 points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
This year has been difficult.
I am very grateful to Thomas for lifting me up and believing in me.
So happy, so happy, that we won the cup again.
It’s a team and I’m really happy that I was able to help,” Garcia said emotionally after the European victory.
The relay is handed over to John Ram, who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday with 2 and 1 in the individual games.
“I feel incredibly proud to have been able to beat Tiger Woods, and as I grew up, I watched his games,” said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost all four games he played in France and now has a career record in the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
This is an unusual statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, immediately after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team worked tirelessly throughout the week to find the right path, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who played golf at a high level throughout the championship.
After a poor performance for his team, the American captain said, “I’m so proud of these guys, they fought.”
We put a little pressure on Europe in the morning.
We've failed.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're gonna have to get back together, work with the PGA and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move on.
I really love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
Hats off.
We were fooled.”
