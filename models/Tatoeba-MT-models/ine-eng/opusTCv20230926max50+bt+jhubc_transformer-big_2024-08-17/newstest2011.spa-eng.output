What's the story? The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Prague knows neither Voldemort nor the pastry shop
The new councillors of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in the capital will have to overcome, it seems, the obvious language barriers for the components of the Prague Board and the City Council to understand their renewed partners of the SDGs.
The Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz period "examined" the members of the new Council of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD to check their knowledge of the slang-marked language that has emerged in recent years in the Council, when the current members of the coalition ruled Prague.
The coded dictionary that used the political flower and nativity of Prague during the previous period, by Mayor Pavel Bém, includes some of the most well-known characters, situations and causes of the metropolis.
Surprisingly, it has been found that the new councilors almost do not understand these well-known concepts.
At least, that's what they say.
"Who is Voldemort?"
“The truth is, I don’t know.”
"I'm more of a newcomer to the politics of Prague," said Culture Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> during the terminology exam.
And as for the political veteran, Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina reacted the same.
Perhaps you know the concept of "golf hole".
"Perhaps it's the only expression of all you've asked me what I use from time to time."
"If not, I usually don't use slang."
From the glossary, whose definitions were published by the newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz last June before the SDG voting congress, the editorial board chose six examples, in particular those that are especially related to the municipal authorities in Prague.
The socialists had to explain the concepts of "Voldemort", "Prague's biggest golf hole", "go to the pastry shop", "bull's neck", "tradition of the capital" and "blinding".
Three councillors agreed to undergo the test and a fourth, Anton<0xC3><0xAD>n Weinert, who in the future will be responsible for education in Prague, initially agreed, but did not pick up the phone again.
The fifth councillor, Petr Dol<0xC3><0xAD>nek, refused to do so.
“I don’t get into these things and I’m not going to appreciate how the civic democrats are having fun.”
“What I do care about is how we will understand each other in the execution of our programs,” he said.
As it has been seen, Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Kauck<0xC3><0xBD> allegedly did not realize that the above title is an expression of an influential businessman and a friend of former Mayor Bem, Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
The word "Voldemort" says nothing to Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>; the only term he hit on the exam is "Prague's largest golf hole".
"It's the Blanka tunnel," says Kauck<0xC3><0xBD>, who immediately adds: "But I know it from the news."
“I’m going to have to sign up for a language course,” he jokes.
Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina is not the only one who recognizes the Blanka tunnel in the golf hole, but also the Environment Councillor Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD>.
Afterwards, both socio-democrats know who Voldemort really is and Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plach<0xC3><0xBD> even knows where to find that character; moreover, he suspects the meaning of "going to the pastry shop".
"I think it means going to a company in Prague"; it is soon revealed to Plach<0xC3><0xBD> that it is the headquarters of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's companies.
Like B<0xC5><0x99>ezina, it indicates that such knowledge was obtained from the news, but that it does not employ such vocabulary.
According to the participants in the test, among the socio-democrats there is no glossary so familiar of colloquial terms.
“I asked my colleagues, but it really doesn’t seem like we have anything like it.”
“Rather, among us we use nicknames, sometimes abbreviations or make word games with names,” says the president of Prague’s <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>, whose party colleagues call Hulda.
“At school they called me B<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>za, but I don’t know if my classmates call me that too,” says Karel B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
The newspaper Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz tested the name and it works.
For his party mates, Weinert is D<0xC4><0x9B>da (similar to "yayo") or, less friendly, D<0xC4><0x9B>dek ("old"), the representative Miroslav Poche, with whom they associated before the election cheats during the sponsorship of the party, receives the nickname "Igr<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek" ("playmobil") from some of his peers.
Nicknames are also the only expressions that socio-democrats tolerate in speech within the party.
Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> does not like to be called Hulda, but Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz even discovered other nicknames for this Prague president.
"The doctor of the rights of fucks" seems to recall that Petr Hul<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD> obtained his doctorate in Law at the Bratislava Police Academy.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches", according to a brochure published in
Women considered as witches in Burkina Faso share certain characteristics.
They are usually elderly, unable to work, for example, for health reasons, are single and have no children.
Women who "return" witches are sent to an isolated area, so as not to harm the rest of the village.
"Men rarely suffer such a bell."
“Healthy young women are not isolated either, because they help in the work and have children,” explains a nun who, in the West African state capital, Burkina Faso is engaged in a special residence of more than a hundred women expelled from their communities.
The local government has decided to oppose this unusual "social measure".
He issued an information leaflet that should help to avoid witch-hunting.
However, this has a catch.
“More than 70% of adults in Burkina Faso can’t read,” warns Die Standard newspaper about the disadvantages of written sensitization.
Accusations of witchcraft are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, neighbouring Burkina Faso, 72-year-old Ammy Hemmah died last week when three women and two men tortured her, covered her with gasoline and burned her.
The news appeared on the BBC.
The authors claim that it was due to an unfortunate set of circumstances.
According to her version, the woman was burned in the oil used for ritual anointings.
It was set on fire when the group wanted to "expel the evil spirits" from the woman.
The isolation of "witches" is supported by people of all educational levels.
The Der Standard newspaper quoted a 42-year-old businessman from Burkina Faso: “Human soul eaters have always posed a danger,” he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to appease the witch-hunt, in The Gambia last year the president still participated in it.
“Gambian President Jammeh, after the death of his aunt, launched a large-scale hunt for witches who had allegedly been linked to his death and had attempted to kill the president himself through black magic.”
“To help him, he brought shamans from nearby Guinea who, protected by police, military and the president’s personal escort, forcibly took randomly chosen men and women from Gambian peoples to the president’s property in Kanilai,” Amnesty International said in its report.
At the farm, the arrested people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects that, in addition, caused them intestinal and kidney problems.
Two of the arrested did not survive the stay at the farm.
After international pressure, they finally released about a thousand detainees.
Bakala tenant: heats up with coal stoves and signs higher rent
The man, elderly and reclusive, crossed the doors of the customer service center of the company RPG Byty of the "coal magnate" Zde<0xC5><0x88>ek Bakala, the largest private owner of flats for rent in the Czech Republic.
Under his arm he was carrying documents with the new three-story rental contracts: his, that of his daughter and that of his son, who is serving sentence.
All three of them have just been caught up in the liberalization of rents.
Instead of 3,500 Czech crowns per month, the child will pay from next year 4,100 crowns for a two-room apartment with separate second-class kitchen.
"In addition, it does not have hot water and the heating is based on a solid fuel boiler," the man shows with his finger in his son's new contract, on whose signature he has full powers.
"But I signed it," he explains half angry, half resigned.
The civil association BytyOKD.cz, which described the new rental conditions as "incorrect and indecent", recommends that tenants do not sign the new contracts and wait until December 7, when it will publish a guide informing on how to proceed in these cases.
But, before this, man only makes a breath.
"Everyone says one thing," he says with a bad face.
Ostrava is becoming a major testing laboratory for liberalization.
After the New Year it will happen with the vast majority of the flats that, in the Czech Republic, were so far under a regulated rent.
Therefore, Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz decided to visit the "laboratory" in person.
The RPG mining waiting room is one of four in Ostrava and, on Tuesday at nine, it was already full.
Right next to the doors are the security guards and next to them a machine to pick up number.
"Rent 2011", can be read on a bright button of your touch screen.
When you press it, a piece of paper with a number comes out of the machine.
Almost no time to read "157" and already the number appears on the large screen located at the top of the room.
In a second, you're in line.
Soon after, an elderly couple arrives to ask, but the crowd in the room is not here for the new rentals.
Most people come to solve common problems, as in the past: requests for arrangements, insurance issues and similar matters.
The letters with the new rental contracts will arrive in Ostrava to the mailboxes of the tenants of most of the 44,000 floors belonging to RPG around mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes in the cards an increase in the rent of between 15 and 38%.
On November 18, a special window opens in the customer service center for new rentals.
“It’s been running for a week, so it’s starting,” the workers who are in it when the client presents themselves as a journalist answer, after briefly doubting.
The liberalization and former Bakala mining floors are the most sensitive issues in the area.
Before the elections, they were already treated high and clear by the vice-president of the Parliament, originally from Ostrava, Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek, of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, and now they appear continuously in the newspapers of the area.
“Twenty years later, I want a new floor.”
“I didn’t even change the damn bathroom dish,” the man mentioned in the introduction exhales.
According to the workers, for the moment they come more than anything retired to check if they receive a discount on the rent if they sign on time, as promised by the special offer of RPG.
The remaining tenants who sign the new contract before December 15 will also receive half of the discount on the February rent.
However, the window of the mining "liberalization" certainly does not manage to dispel the avalanche of doubts.
“Of the 360 customers who were here yesterday, only about forty or fifty people asked about the rental in 2011,” the window employee said.
Meanwhile, RPG proposes to hold individual meetings on contracts on the web and on its boards when necessary.
If the two parties do not reach an agreement on the lease, an independent judge will have to resolve the matter.
“This is not a threat, but information about the only possible way to proceed and fully comply with the law,” the company said in a statement.
“No one is going to be judged here,” says one of the employees of RPG Byty and a man who is on the street in front of the customer service center gives him, at least in part, the reason.
“I get a pension of 13,000 and I have 5,000 left for food; I have no means to go to court,” he says.
But, immediately, the employee sows the doubt.
"We'll see."
"Mr. Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek warns them in the media not to sign, so maybe people will wait," he said.
Rent regulation will cease to exist in most of the Czech Republic in early 2011 and, according to RPG Byty, its increase is an economic necessity.
“The current rents still don’t even cover the amounts necessary for the maintenance of the community fund,” recalls Pavel Klime<0xC5><0xA1>, director of the residential portfolio of the company RPG Byty, who adds that the careless state of the community fund that annoys tenants is, for owners, the main reason for increasing rent.
While during the five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG was able to invest with the rents in apartments four billion, in the four years that will go from 2011 to 2014 the figure will increase to 5.2 billion.
The large screen hanging from the ceiling, in front of the waiting room seats, now repeats some data that stands out in red.
"The increase in rental in 2011 by 15% and less applies to 31,200 apartments, i.e. more than 90% of RPG properties."
“In addition, it will always be a maximum of 7.50 Czech crowns per square meter per month,” the screen reads.
Only increased by 38% the rental of 400 floors of the RPG portfolio.
“In such cases, it’s an increase from extremely low amounts, of 19.66 crowns per square meter,” says RPG.
In 2,600 flats, the rent will remain unchanged next year.
RPG Byty promises that liberalization will not hit rents at once, but will scale up between four and eight years.
In addition, he adds the following commitment: the company will invest all the money from the rise of the rent (see the graph) again on the floors, mainly in heating savings: new windows and heating.
Priority will be given to the people who sign the rental rise agreement.
Architects have understood that offices also need daycare
The Avriopoint administrative building in Brno is the new headquarters of the company Arch.Design.
No one would say that it also hides inside a small nursery with everything similar to such facilities: colorful walls, creative furniture and even a miniature park on the outdoor terrace.
Since October of last year, the children of Arch.Design employees can go to it.
The architectural project company Arch.Design, whose studio came out of numerous well-known buildings in Brno, thought from the first sketches of the Avriopoint building to include a space for its mini-kindergarten.
The company employs around 90 people, mainly at the age of the baby boom and wanted to allow architects and designers to return to work soon after motherhood.
Along with the possibility of enjoying a reduced schedule, the nursery is one of the benefits offered by Arch.Design to its workers within the framework of its social program.
Builders and architects thus have the possibility to combine a demanding profession with childcare.
The mini-kindergarten was an idea of Arch.Designu’s own employees and, with the support of the management, they managed to obtain funding from the European Union and the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs.
The company’s mini-kindergarten is financed through the European Social Fund under the Operational Programme for Human Resources and Employment, as well as the state budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to the funding granted (a grant of more than 2.8 million Czech crowns) they were able to buy the equipment and, after two years, hire qualified personnel and services.
When funding runs out (two years), Arch.Design has an obligation to keep the mini-kindergarten running with its own funds for three years.
The preparation of the project lasted one year and the company Economy Rating contributed to the submission of the application for funding.
The care of the children is in the hands of qualified staff; in addition, a nurse and a teacher from the Ministry of Education are present all day for their care. The nursery currently welcomes children without age limit, although most of them are less than three years old.
Since it is a "mini-kindergarten", it can only accommodate a maximum of five children simultaneously, although with shifts they come more during the day.
The operation of the nursery is flexible to adapt to the needs of parents and children of all workers have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of the hierarchy within the company.
Although it is an individual education and care, the contents of the mini-kindergarten program are comparable to the regular preschool curriculum.
In it, children not only play, but also receive quality education: from basic learning to school preparation, they teach up to English.
The class not only has toys and board games, but also a computer for children.
The presence of young children in the company itself create a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can go to see their children at any time and avoid the stress of late picking up school children when they are away from their workplace.
Thus, parents are more productive while working.
It is not surprising that this naturally generates a relationship of loyalty between the worker and his employer.
In this way, Arch.Design ranks among the firms that offer a great advantage for the admission of new workers: they support the family and, in short, this program strengthened staff marketing.
The House of Bones continues to fascinate after 100 years.
The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric lizard, the stairs resemble the column of a dinosaur, and the balconies look like the mouth of an open fish.
This is the Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, in Barcelona, by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Due to its shape similar to a skeleton, the locals nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Its organic forms, its striking colors, the innovative use of stone, the fragments of tiles and mosaics, a facade reminiscent of the scales and the ubiquitous lines gently curved, all this is typical of the secession of Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
The cover of the house plays with dreamy lines, delicate colors and textures taken from nature and fauna.
Paying more attention, one observes a certain geometry, rhythm and a carefully thought-out order.
At night, the entire facade of the house looks even more impressive, since it is illuminated in such a way that the brightness of the colors is improved.
Serpentea and the twisting of the forms continues to surprise us also inside.
The corrugated wood copies the frames of the windows, the railings, the ornaments of the doors, the mirrors and the signs.
Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, located in the Eixample district at number 43 of the lively shopping street of Passeig de Gr<0xC3><0xA0>cia, emerged from the refurbishment of an 1877 house by the architect Emilio Sala Cortés.
The reconstruction lasted two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, the wealthy industrialist Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, initially insisted on demolishing the previous building and starting from scratch, but soon accepted Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s idea of a novel and cheaper reconstruction.
However, Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, consisting of several apartments, was not designed by Antoni Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> alone.
The architect Josep Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Jujol collaborated in the design.
In fact, in their plans of the project emerged ornaments for the representative apartment of the owner of the property and the mosaics used on the facade.
Other creators and artists also work on the fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade.
The collaboration in the proposals of Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3> was the beginning of Jujol’s successful collaboration with Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>.
Jujol participated in the construction of Casa Mila and Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>’s G<0xC3><0xBC>ell Park, where other pieces of it are located.
Due to its organic form, the locals soon after its completion nicknamed it "the house of bones".
Others, due to the specific mechanism of opening the windows began to call it "the house of yawns".
It is also said that, at the top of the construction, the sword of San Jorge, patron of Catalonia, appears.
Other sculptural elements of the construction hide religious motifs.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> designed in the house a unique system for the central heating season with ventilation vents and typical fireplaces.
It may be strange your inclination of forty-five degrees.
During the construction, Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> did not respect the construction rules of the moment at all and was not influenced by them.
Even so, the construction obtained the corresponding permission from the beginning, although obviously in it the data indicated on the planned reconstruction were so vague that, two years later, at its completion, the town hall was so shocked with the result that it asked for correction.
He was annoyed, for example, that the construction included columns even up to the public sidewalk.
Arrangements were never made, quite the contrary: just fifteen days after the request of the town hall, Josep Batll<0xC3><0xB3> requested (and obtained) permission to rent the two highest floors of the building.
On the lower floors the owner himself was installed.
In the gallery on the second floor was the living room and on the third floor the bedrooms and the private part of the apartment.
The ground floor was rented out to a jewelry store.
The six-story house is completely traversed by a staircase leading up to the roof terrace.
The basic elements of the reform consisted in breaking all the angles and straight lines, covering them with curved walls.
Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> also worked with the modern concept of the connection of space.
The common part can be fully connected by opening the doors of the rooms and a larger group can communicate in this way without problems, without giving up the privacy necessary for more intimate conversations.
The house, with the reconstruction of Gaud<0xC3><0xAD>, not only got a new facade, but also an unusual roof and two additional floors.
It is also impressive how Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> plays with light, white and blue tiles that cover the inner courtyard and skylights.
The play with the two colors provides maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was based simply on the principle that white reflects more light than dark colors, which on the contrary absorb sunlight.
Anyone can visit Casa Batll<0xC3><0xB3>, which in 2005 was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List.
On the first floor of the house is the most spacious and most reloaded apartment of those accessible to the public.
The owners decided to open the doors to the public in 2002, on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator.
With the visits they confirmed, or discovered, that it is a very beneficial business and extended the visits to the common area and the attic, including the roof terrace.
The price of the entrance to the monument is not insignificant, it reaches 16.50 euros, although students, retirees and holders of tourist cards get a 20% discount.
The amount considerably exceeds the price of the entrance of other Gaud<0xC3><0xAD> buildings in the city.
If you want to enjoy the real atmosphere of the bed with its lizard towers, you should quickly make friends with a resident of the neighboring houses and visit him at home.
How to choose the mattress and the somier: women and men look for different things
Nothing of a pompous frame for the bed; what really confers its quality to a good bed is the surface to lie down, that is, the mattress and the sommer.
First of all, they must be perfectly complemented in order to adapt to specific users.
During the election, numerous elements come into play, including the weight, height, health status and gender of the owner.
Also important is the type of interior in which the mattress and sommer are located.
A typical example?
For example, in a weekend cabin that does not usually have heating, latex mattresses should not be used because they "warm up" more slowly.
In addition, they usually weigh considerably more than the usual polyurethane mattresses.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn them more often.
If the channels in the center are not properly ventilated and, above, they are on a firm base, they keep the moisture inside.
When choosing a bed, habits also influence.
Those who have spent a lot of time abroad often use a very high mattress with a soft layer and will have trouble feeling good on a lower and harder surface.
“Almost every hockey player who came back from the NHL complained that they didn’t sleep as well here.”
"For their crushed shoulders, heels and hips they needed mattresses with a soft layer of viscoelastic."
"These types of mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have problems with the nervous system, so they receive poorly information from joints and skin," explains Sylva Hadamczikov<0xC3><0xA1>, who specializes in upholstered furniture.
Many hockey players, like other customers, have been preferring viscoelastic mattresses for some time.
"Today there is no problem, because they have these suitable Tempur and the Italian Magniflex, but also the Czech brand Tropico."
You no longer have to be an NHL player to appreciate the viscoelastic.
This "miracle" works in a very simple way.
It optimizes its stiffness and shape depending on the absorbed heat or adapts to your body heat.
Nothing exerts pressure; during the night, it will not spin like after a hard match.
He just sleeps better.
Viscoelastic also works as a protection against sores.
When choosing the size of the mattress, add to its height the length of your feet, that is, between 21 and 34 cm.
A man or woman with a height of about 180 cm will need a bed of between 210 and 220 cm.
The minimum width for a person should be, in a double room, 90 cm, in total 180 cm.
In the case of single rooms, for example singles, a minimum of 120 to 140 cm is recommended.
So that a possible visit is also comfortable.
"If not, you can apply a simple rule to calculate the width: when lying face up, you should have your hands comfortably shrunk to the elbows," advises the engineer Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>, an expert at Cechu <0xC4><0x8D>aloun<0xC3><0xAD>k<0xC5><0xAF> a dekoratér<0xC5><0xAF>, who has been dealing with the problem of healthy sleep and the special issue of school mobility for many years.
In double rooms, each one needs its own somier and mattress, so during the purchase you have to pay attention to combine the height of the mattresses.
Otherwise, it will be necessary to mount the bed bases at different heights, which is not always possible in all beds.
Foam mattresses should have a minimum height of 14 cm, models with inner springs a minimum of 15 cm, of which at least three centimeters are for the layer that adapts to the shapes and softness.
“By touching it with your hand or by sleeping on the mattress, you should definitely not notice the docks,” warns Helena Prokopov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Each mattress requires a certain type of mattress.
The fully padded bedrooms, in which the mattress and base are like Siamese, make no sense in the bedroom.
Mattresses breathe poorly and you can not wash their cover, which today is often done.
And, since we sweat between 0.2 and 0.75 l of sweat every night, it is clear that after about five or seven years the mattress will begin to remind us of a large (and congested) screen.
For this reason, specialists reject slogans that speak of a mattress life of up to 25 years or even a lifetime guarantee.
However, everything has a but.
Therefore, sellers give a tip: in mattresses with a width of 120 or 140 cm, take care of cleaning and washing the cover carefully, but better add a mattress protector that can be easily removed and washed.
Although currently manufactured zippered mattress covers throughout its perimeter, so when opening them they remain in two parts (something very important for washing and the size of the washing machine!), their manipulation in the larger models (and by a single person) when lifting the mattress can seem like a fight between a fly weight and a heavy weight.
In bed, instead of a soother, do you have a firm board?
Never! Never!
At least for the beds designed for overnight visits.
However, it should make (if you don’t already have them) ventilation holes in the table and should be used with a mattress with springs inside and a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in bags (such as the German Taschenfederkern) and a soft layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be used on such bases.
For non-jointable sheet bottoms and containing between 14 and 18 sheets, latex mattresses or sandwich mattresses (e.g., a combination of latex and coconut fiber) may be used, although it is always better to have a bottom with a greater number of sheets, 28 or more, in which the regular sheets of the lumbar region are reinforced and can be stiffened.
Jointed sheet underlays should not be used with a spring mattress, as it does not react to reclining.
In addition to adjusting the rigidity of the sheets, shoulder protection can also be used.
It is a special fixation of the sheets that allows you to press or even tilt the sheets so that they "round" perfectly to the shoulders during sleep.
For men who have very wide shoulders, this is very important.
They are even remembered by mattress manufacturers who, in the "masculine", began to use a softer area precisely around the shoulders.
They also remember women, for whom they put a softer area around the hips.
For the most demanding customers, there are soles with cross structure or boards with the so-called multi-torsion damping.
The pressure is distributed between different points and the voltage is lowered.
It should also be borne in mind that, even if you use the right mattress and soother, if you use a bad pillow (large and "mullida"), most of the advantages will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: the pillow should hold the head and the corners can only reach the shoulders, so that the muscles of the same can be relaxed.
The recommended suitable size is 50 x 60 cm, something normal for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be at the same level (when combined with the somier with shoulder reinforcement or the softer area of the mattress) as the height of the shoulders.
Modern mattresses have something to do with, it seems, the original mattresses filled with straw.
Manufacturers continue to use, more and more often, natural materials or at least mixtures.
In fact, biological mattresses are fashionable.
Petroleum-based raw materials, with which polyurethane foam is made, are filled with natural oils, for example castor or soybean.
In fact, virtually all known manufacturers use soy.
“Organic, in the case of mattresses, means that the center is made only of materials of natural origin,” explains Petr Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from Tropico Plus.
Also, natural substances are used during the manufacture of the mattress cover, one of the first aloe vera.
But you can also opt for microcapsules, which release a fresh scent to forest or lavender.
There are also differences for men and women.
While men "refresh" with vegetable extracts of breeze, so that the mattress cover absorbs the heat and refreshes the body, women prefer to "warm up" the cover.
Red pepper extract improves blood circulation, so that women feel more warmth.
Favorites currently?
The mattresses made of cold foam, which are more porous, with an adapted cell structure, which makes them more permeable than those of normal polyurethane and offer more permeability.
The combination of various rigidities of cold foam and viscoelastic make it possible to manufacture mattresses from various areas that know perfectly where the head, shoulders and heels go.
A good quality mattress will cost you seven thousand crowns up.
Those who perform a therapeutic function usually have a lower VAT, since they are considered as health means.
The first to gain this advantage in the Czech Republic was Gumotex.
It is difficult to save on mattresses and bedspreads.
Sometimes you can approve offers from manufacturers or sellers, who sometimes offer two mattresses for the price of one.
For example, the Magniflex brand offers Duofreeze mattresses with a Memory foam attached to the case for 11,990 crowns.
The second is obtained free of charge.
The era of viscoelastic with an open cell structure and high density began with Tempur's "cosmic" material.
It initially emerged as material for NASA, because during takeoff astronauts were subjected to a huge overload.
Tempur softens with heat and hardens with cold.
Therefore, the human body, warm, exerts a perfect effect and optimally adapts its pressure.
Therefore, it is ideal to prevent sores from occurring, but also to improve comfort during sleep.
Viscoelastic foam is not only used in mattresses, but also for sanitary products, for example for pillows that are placed under the legs and relieve them, as well as their circulation.
National manufacturers, for example, use Eucatherm C or Twinsaver foam and the like.
More and more parents are using people-tracking devices to control their children
The fear of children leads more and more people to think about controlling them by GPS.
The system, initially designed for vehicle tracking, can also track the movement of people and thus contribute, for example, in the case of the disappearance of the nine-year-old girl Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka Janatkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
At the moment the device is about the size of a matchbox, but will soon be reduced to the size of a watch.
Many people feared the case of the missing Ani<0xC4><0x8D>ka and began to report on the means available to better protect their children.
Even at the cost of invading your privacy.
“We’re all trying to tell ourselves that it’s not about spying, but about another means to lessen the chances of a tragedy happening,” says Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the providers of tracking devices in the Czech market.
"I recognize that, in certain cases, you can abuse such devices, for example if they get into someone's bag without their knowledge, but we have not yet come across such cases."
“Most customers actually buy it for security reasons,” Pilin adds.
In their opinion, children should always know what the "box" is for and how to use it in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1> warns about the fact that, if the child does not want to carry it, he will simply throw it away.
“Even young children show great creativity in intentionally losing certain things if they want to avoid being controlled.”
“In the past, parents relied heavily on mobile phones, but these could be turned off as easily as the tracking device,” says Bo<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>.
In his opinion, it is debatable if in case of attack such a device is really useful.
“If it’s a pre-arranged kidnapping, the author will almost always check if the child is wearing any kind of electronic device that can reveal their location.”
"Now it's the phone."
"As the use of tracking devices is extended, you will also look for them, since their sale will undoubtedly be carried out with a lot of advertising."
“In such cases, criminals always go one step ahead of the police,” says the psychologist.
However, he adds that such devices can help in the case of an improvised attack from a pedophile.
According to Robert <0xC4><0x8C>ech of RC Monitoring, which offers tracking services for both vehicles and people, even if, after an attack, the tracking device is immediately destroyed, its presence can help.
"The device can be configured to regularly send the position after a certain period."
"If he suffers damage, at least it will facilitate the last position of the person in question."
“The most expensive devices have an incline meter integrated, so if the person simply slips and remains motionless, the device will immediately issue a warning with the position in question,” says <0xC4><0x8C>ech.
In his opinion, such a service can be obtained even with mobile phones with navigation, on which only special software should be installed.
The problem with current tracking units is that at the moment they are devices of similar size to a matchbox or smaller mobile phones.
Therefore, they can be lost.
According to Pilin de Macro Weil, for this reason, tests are currently being carried out with devices that look like a digital clock.
"In addition, they will have the added advantage that a potential attacker may not identify the device."
“Or that I identify it after a certain time, which can make the police gain time,” he adds.
Although tracking devices are worn on the wrist or hanging, they will continue to use the same technology used for vehicle tracking.
It is a position check with a GPS system (which is used in the usual navigation in the car) combined with the function of a mobile phone that communicates the current position.
The army has enough wicks to surround the whole of the Czech Republic. But they only last two years
The Czech army bought 445 kilometers of wick to ignite explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defense added 224 kilometers of mecha to its arsenal.
Therefore, they have stocks for 225 years.
The problem is that the service life of the wick is two years, four at the most.
The army bought the explosive wick from the STV Group, a. s. for forty million crowns.
The General’s staff responded to MF DNES justifying the purchase of such a huge amount of wick saying that soldiers need 60 kilometers of wick per year for training maneuvers.
According to the calculations of the army pyrotechnicians, with whom MF DNES was contacted, it is decided, however, that, in such a case, should carry out such maneuvers with frequent use of explosives every year also all generals, high-ranking officers, and even secretaries and cleaners.
They did not want the Minister of Defense Alexandr Vondr and the captain of the army Vlastimil Pickek to be exempt.
Only in this way could it be justified for the army to spend sixty kilometers of wick.
This is equivalent to 25,000 explosions.
Even if that were the case, the army would have sufficient stocks for more than ten years.
If on the contrary, as experts say, for the initial training of each new professional arrives with a maximum of two meters of wick, the army would have with the new purchase (even adding the consumption of the units of engineers or special) sufficient stocks for the 225 indicated above.
The soldiers of the rapid-action brigade complained personally to Minister Vondra recently because they say they barely have ammunition for various weapons, so even the practice of shooting for money is limited.
And let's not talk about the lack of underwear.
"I also fail to understand that such quantities of wick are repeatedly purchased from us."
“But it’s their decision, and they’ll certainly know why they’re acting like that.”
“For us, the army is a good customer that we, as a company, try to satisfy,” admits the commercial director of STV Group, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek defends the hundreds of miles of mech, also saying he will have stocks of this “munition” for at least ten years.
However, Jan D<0xC4><0x9B>ck<0xC3><0xBD>, from STV Group, indicates that the wick has only a four-year service life and, in the case of pyrotechnic products for the army or police, a two-year service life.
"If stored in perfect conditions, it can last up to four," says one soldier who, for possible criticisms of the army, does not want to give his name.
After the end of its service life, each ammunition must be carefully checked to see if it remains reliable and will not harm the soldiers.
But these tests are not free and require additional investment.
Another argument of the Ministry is that, when buying 445 kilometers of mecha, he got a discount.
“They cost us 60 percent less than last year’s order of 244 kilometers,” said Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, a spokesman for the Ministry of Defense’s purchasing center.
Just to compare: the annual wick consumption of police pyrotechnics, which eliminate the ammunition of World War II or that left by the Soviet army, does not exceed 1,500 meters for years.
In addition, the police always ask only the fair amount to exhaust the ammunition before its useful life ends.
They decided for safety reasons for pyrotechnicians and, in the meantime, more modern and reliable types of wick can be obtained.
The Ministry already has clear difficulties in finishing tens of thousands of tons of ammunition from the time of the Warsaw Pact, when the Czechoslovak army of two hundred thousand people was preparing for a campaign in the Rhine.
According to the pyrotechnics with which MF DNES spoke, after a couple of years there will be the following problem with the current one: we will have to eliminate hundreds of kilometers of old mecha, which is now being bought "cheap".
So far I still live from the contacts I got thanks to the contest
Winning the Entrepreneur of the Year contest helped Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun sell his hotel franchises.
The latest edition, won the contest "Entrepreneur of the Year" 28-year-old entrepreneur Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun of Liberec.
Its success story looks like it came out of a movie.
And Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun loved to travel.
Abroad he realized that in Liberec needed quality accommodation at a good price.
With the savings he gathered from seasonal work abroad and a bank credit he bought a house that was half-destroyed composed of five floors.
Considering he was still studying his third year in college, he was really brave.
“Currently, the value for money of accommodation in our area pushed me to do something about it,” says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun.
He began renting the reconstructed first floor to foreign workers.
All the income he earned invested them back in the building, which gradually turned into a 54-room guesthouse.
Since then, in seven years in business, he gradually managed to open in Liberec four guest houses, two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of around 300 in all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of all was, until recently, the four-star design hotel Pytloun.
However, this year it opened another of the same quality.
“We have just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov or Tisé, to which we have sold our franchise concept, and other people are showing interest in a Pytloun franchise,” said the number one entrepreneur last year.
“This sale of licenses for the opening of hotels was greatly helped by the fact of winning the ‘Businessman of the Year’ contest,” Pytloun adds gratefully.
The victory increased its fame and popularity both in Liberec and in the surrounding area.
“People recognized me on the street, they still congratulated me often and, I must say, it was very nice,” he recalls.
Without a doubt, we recommend that everyone wants to try some company to participate in the contest.
But consider that it is not necessary to win, but that participation is already beneficial.
He claims that, so far, he still lives on the contacts and acquaintances that, without the contest, he might not have obtained.
"With some people I met thanks to the contest I have started to collaborate regularly."
The fame associated with success, in his opinion, also included in the employees,
in total about seventy.
“I’ve seen that they show greater loyalty and are proud to participate in something that gained general recognition.”
“It’s not my own personal success, it’s the result of the hard work of the whole team.”
"It is only my name that appears in the foreground," says Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pytloun modestly today.
I wish my successor a quieter year than we have had at Farmet
The euphoria for victory soon dissipated by the impact of the crisis.
Thanks to the hard work of the winner, Farmet may have already gone through the worst.
The owner of the company Farmet, Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>, received the first prize in the last edition of Vodafone’s “Company of the Year” contest, last year at the “Slavic House” in Prague.
The jury valued his efforts, with which he managed to turn a small technical workshop in <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Skalice into a firm with a turnover of hundreds of millions.
“I can say that the award not only encouraged me, but all my collaborators and improved our confidence to fight against the competition,” says last year’s winner.
The history of Farmet begins with the desire to do something useful.
Therefore, when the state proposed to Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>’s father the rental of a small workshop as compensation for the property embargo during communism, he did not hesitate much; he resigned his position in the company in which he worked and, with a couple of colleagues, founded the company with his father of plastic piles.
Soon after, they began to specialize in vegetable oil presses.
Eight years later they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central Europe.
They also gained a greater presence among the non-specialized public after achieving success in the competition in the media.
“Not only did our customers begin to see the Farmet brand as considerably better, but also foreign partners began to value the collaboration with a company that achieved greater success in their country,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Last year maybe it wasn’t Farmet just a sign of the euphoria of victory.
It also gained recognition for its commercial results up to 2008 and, in part, from 2009.
And 2009 was the hardest year for the sale of machinery.
The worsening of the crisis, which had not yet reached so many citizens, caused companies to stop their investment projects and begin to limit the purchase of new machines or technologies.
"We obviously don't get rid of that either."
“Income was reduced by 40%, we had to limit production and we even had some layoffs,” explains Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A viable company must sometimes adopt even unpopular measures.
However, they controlled the situation and maintained the company’s profits, even if they were at lower levels than before the crisis.
Despite everything, where Farmet did not cut costs was in research and development.
“With the grants we have built a research and training center, we have strengthened our presence in the international market and we have obtained excellent valuations at national fairs,” says <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
Everything indicates that they have already left the crisis behind.
Revenues are rising again and, with them, the number of new employees.
“The new achievement is expected to bring a feeling of victory, but in a calmer atmosphere,” says Karel <0xC5><0xBD><0xC4><0x8F><0xC3><0xA1>rsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
A Survey That Reveals Ridiculous Rules
The Absurdity of the Year survey is part of the business tournament for the fourth time.
It has already managed to eliminate some ridiculous rules.
The unknown winner of the new edition of the Absurdity survey of the year was the obligation to bring to the administration documents that officials can access online.
The decision was taken by more than a third of the nearly 4,000 voters.
For example, the social security administration requested an extract from the trade register, although its officials can obtain it with two mouse movements.
Thanks to the survey, this has changed.
"The Czech Social Security Administration will no longer request an extract from the commercial register when it carries out a control of the insured's taxes," <0xC4><0x8C>SSZ spokeswoman Jana Bura<0xC5><0x88>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The aim of the Absurdity of the Year survey is to consult the rules and regulations that companies and entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic must respect and to try to eliminate those that are absurd.
This year, for the fourth time, it forms part of the corporate tournament of the Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny publication and begins to create fans also among the general public.
While last year’s edition had the participation of three thousand voters, this year it practically reached four thousand.
And it is not surprising, since we still have several legal obligations that must be respected simply to trade.
"Perhaps in terms of the number of papers needed for the tax return we are in the first place worldwide," says Karel Havl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek from the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic.
For years, the simplification of business rules has been a stated goal of all governments.
However, compared to the rest of the world, the situation is improving especially in the Czech Republic.
According to the World Bank, from the point of view of the conditions for having a company, the Czech Republic is in the 74th position, that is, eight positions worse than last year.
The Absurdity of the Year competition was first held in 2006 and each year is repeated in the same way.
Anyone can indicate any administrative or bureaucratic absurdity every year between April and the end of September, when the contest is closed.
Proposals can be made on the website www.firmaroku.cz. Afterwards, the contest organizer selects seven candidates for the "anti-prize" and, during October, allows the public to vote on the Internet through www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita and www.ihned.cz.
It wins the absurdity that gets the most votes.
For this year’s survey, more than one hundred were presented, in particular 105 rules and regulations that make no sense.
The examples were sent by businessmen as well as professional associations and journalists.
Among the "finalists" of the contest was, for example, the requirement that vehicles for the maintenance of roads and highways pay the toll or that entrepreneurs with twenty employees, two offices and two bathrooms paint the walls every two years.
The list of this year’s 70 proposals is published on the competition pages.
The announcement of the contest, which is always held at the beginning of November in Wenceslas Square in Prague, is part of an event in which personalities from the political and social world usually participate.
This year, for example, the event was attended by Eva Svobodov<0xC3><0xA1>, director of the Association of Small and Medium Enterprises and Entrepreneurs of the Czech Republic, and Petr Ku<0xC5><0xBE>el, president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Republic.
“Economic prosperity cannot be maintained if the state continually puts obstacles in the way of entrepreneurs, so my goal is to eliminate a minimum of thirty paragraphs every year that currently unnecessarily complicate trade,” said Minister of Industry and Trade Martin Kocourek.
Efforts to eliminate absurd regulations do not remain in borage water.
In 2007, what bothered people the most was the employer's obligation to communicate three days in advance to the business office of the permanent operating zone, the intention to go with a post to a fair or exhibition.
This obligation was eliminated in the new industrial law.
The obligation that ended second in number of votes in 2007, i.e. the communication to the work office by foreign workers from work trips of up to 30 days, was eliminated in the so-called green card law.
And the third is victory.
The Absurdity of 2009 was the regulation for physiotherapists to have in their consultation a large mirror, a refrigerator and two floor scales.
Therefore, this year the Ministry of Health issued a communication saying that it had eliminated the obligation to have a refrigerator.
A new category recognizes socially responsible companies
Ecological, humanitarian, educational or sports projects are valued.
The novelty in this fifth edition of the Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny contest is the category called Responsible Company of the Year 2010.
The purpose of this contest is to support responsible and fair companies.
"In this way we want to support companies that deal with the impact of their activity on the environment and that support socially responsible activities," says Patrik Bartholdy, regional director of the mobile operator of the company Vodafone, organizer and sponsor of the competition, as in the case of the Rebel of the Year competition.
For this new special subcategory of this year’s edition of the main competition of Vodafone Company of the year 2010 were presented companies for which commercial success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is inspiring and would allow us to write an independent article.
Although the type of activities varies completely between each other, the common denominator is the support and consideration they offer.
In one case, it is for example disabled people, in other of the personal or health problems of employees.
Among the fourteen finalists from all over the Republic was, for example, the software company Et Netera, which supports the formation of informal sports teams among its workers, who later participate in tournaments of various sports.
Another example of a company responsible for the Pardubice area is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been the main donor of funds to sponsor disabled children for seven years.
In Pod<0xC4><0x9B>brad, there is a paper mill that is especially concerned about the health problems of its workers, since they make up more than 70% of the workforce; that is why it received the title of Company responsible for the central area of the Czech Republic and in the Vodafone Company competition of the year ended in third place in the region.
In Olomouc he won the accounting company MiRyz Soft, which reduced the working hours, even below the average of 35 hours per week, without reducing wages.
The title was also awarded because it buys primarily from Czech manufacturers, supports community activities in the area and respects the environment.
“We try to recycle as much as possible so that our production and management activities produce the least possible impact on the environment,” explains entrepreneur Milu<0xC5><0xA1>e Ryznarov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The responsible IT company Enlogit in the region of <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> also thinks about the health of its employees and, with each laptop, offered them an ergonomic chair and keyboards; in addition, it supports work from home and in its business events uses the catering services of a local protected company.
"In addition, we support the Persona in trouble grant, which specifically helps the local Roma community," says company representative Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Such<0xC3><0xBD>.
The Pran<0xC3><0xAD> a <0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>n<0xC3><0xAD> laundry company in the Karlovy Vary region, whose employees receive bonuses in a special way that affect their pension funds, is also in a good place with a mention.
"We give benefits in food, transport, skills improvement and leisure," says Josef Strap<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>, of the construction company of Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l Czasch, winner in the Moravia-Silesia region.
In the category of Company responsible for the year, all regional finalists of the Vodafone Company of the year contest were automatically appointed who answered the questions of the registration form and sent it before August 15 to the organizers.
The organizers removed forms that were not complete or incorrect from the evaluation.
"If the representatives of the competing companies did not answer the questions, they could not participate in the Responsible Company of the Year contest, but they are not disqualified from the "main" Vodafone Company of the Year contest."
“Individual nominations for this competition are not allowed, as it is a subcategory of the main Company competition of the year,” explains Karel Goldman of the Bison & Rose advisory board.
Police arrested during a public auction at the Agricultural Fund building in Pilsen
The anti-corruption police have made several arrests in the Agricultural Fund building in recent days.
The detectives handcuffed a local media entrepreneur and real estate entrepreneur Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G.
It appears that this attempt to manipulate an ongoing public auction for the restitution of rights in such a way that the auctioned land would be received by a precise interested party.
I had to pay Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. half a million kroner for it.
"For the moment I can only say that the police are looking for a person for bribery during a public auction and public tender," Pilsen Attorney General Antonie Zelen<0xC3><0xA1> told Pravvo, adding that at the moment they cannot disclose more details about the ongoing investigation.
Twenty-four hours later, the 46-year-old businessman was released by police.
About how it could influence public auction, given the little official information, can only be speculated.
The spokesman of the Agricultural Fund Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>ra <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1> answered the questions of Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo saying that the police actually carried out the arrest at the headquarters of Pilsen and it was during a public auction.
“This is a customer, not one of our workers,” he said.
According to <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1>, the public auction is called "Call for proposals for the transfer of land in accordance with the law on land" and is held when several interested parties appear in relation to the offered land.
"These people, during the call, offer a higher value than their restitution, which must be transferred before the value of the land is announced."
"Based on the offers, the order of the buyers is determined, and then the Agricultural Fund transfers the land to the person who offers the largest offer," the Fund's spokeswoman explained.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had information about who was going to be present at the call and, since he was also interested because he had acquired various restitution rights, he proposed to those interested in the field that he would not participate in the auction.
For that, he was charging a commission.
This would explain why, at the time of his arrest, he had so much money on him.
Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. had special contacts in the Pilsen Fund for a long time.
It was in the case of the former head of the PF V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Sankot, who was accused of dispatching the replacement of land for which a construction decision had already been issued.
For example, Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> G. has just obtained from the Fund land for the construction of public infrastructure, in particular at the site where a large road to the industrial area of Borsk<0xC3><0xA1> Pole should be built.
Then, he changed them very beneficially with the magistrate for a house in the historic center of the city with a much higher value.
In this case, the town hall had to intervene because, otherwise, the blocked land would avoid construction.
Families will have to pay an additional cost of several hundred crowns per month
Households will have to pay from January not only for all types of energy, but also for water and electricity, heating accessories and, in some cases, larger rents.
As a result, families will have to withdraw several hundred crowns a month from their wallets as of January more than now.
The price of electricity increases by 4.6%, gas around 2%, in some cities they will have to pay up to 10% more for the water supply and many also increase the price of central heating.
The increase in electricity for families living in apartments should amount to about 100 crowns more a year than now.
However, major electricity suppliers have reduced prices, as support for the production of energy from renewable sources, in particular photovoltaics, has increased.
However, the gas is moderately expensive, especially at the time when the heating is most used and, therefore, the higher the consumption.
In this case, they must also count on a couple of hundred more crowns a year.
While electricity and gas are becoming more expensive across the country, the price change of central heating varies from place to place.
The price increase is mainly planned by the largest municipality.
For example, the homes of Pardubice or Hradec Kr<0xC3><0xA1>lové will pay an additional 50 kroner per month from January for central heating, while the families of Liberec will pay more than 1,000 additional kroner per year.
Residents in Prague will also have to endure a 9% increase in the price of water and heating, especially if the city increases the rental of infrastructure.
If the rent does not vary, the Prague residents will pay an additional 6.8%.
Prices in Prague, however, will continue to be among the lowest in the entire country.
In northern Bohemia, where current prices are among the highest, both rates will cost 7.4%.
They can significantly increase the rental prices of 450,000 flats rented in Prague, where the regulation will end in January.
For example, the company CPI Byty, which owns around 2,500 apartments in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem, will increase the rent from January by up to 100%.
The company will take to the courts those who do not agree with the new lease.
Regulated rentals, which benefit residents of around 300,000 flats, could increase next year by as much as 10%.
Czech young people get drunk with Fernet and rum. The beer is no longer so, because it affects slowly
Fernet, rum, vodka and even good whiskeys stolen from his parents.
Those are the drinks that cause young drinkers under the age of fifteen to end up in medical care.
Children who end up lying in hospital continuously to overcome the hangover are no longer an exception.
This is derived from the experience of doctors encountering such cases in hospital pediatric admissions.
"Drinking beer or wine is no longer fashionable, because it takes a long time to get them drunk."
“Now fashion is strong alcoholic beverages,” says Lud<0xC4><0x9B>k Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, head of pediatrics at the Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice Hospital in central Bohemia.
"When they manage to get a bottle from their father from the pantry, it may be whiskey, but it's usually Fernet and vodka."
“Vodka has the advantage of being lightened with juice and not smelling so much,” he explains.
This is also confirmed by the spokesperson of the Motol University Hospital, Eva Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>.
"Normally, it's Fernet or rum."
"These are modern alcoholic beverages, particularly among schoolchildren."
"In some cases, they use brandy that they took at home," Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1> adds.
According to Chief Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n, it is thirteen and fourteen-year-old drinkers who usually appear in hospitals.
Before Ho<0xC5><0x99>ovice, where he has been working since this year, he worked for a decade in pediatrics at Motol, where ambulances took young people from nearby areas.
"A girl had to come in maybe four times."
“It started at the age of twelve, when she was brought in with 3.5 alcohol in her blood, plus a mixture with ecstasy,” the department’s doctor said in a statement.
"He was at Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice fair at a dance party."
“The interesting thing is that his mother wasn’t even surprised that his daughter disappeared for 48 hours,” he said.
It is precisely the lack of interest from parents or even their clear tolerance towards drinking on the part of their children that is considered the main cause of the increase in alcohol consumption among young people.
Experts point out that, in the case of children, dependence cannot be properly spoken of.
“An alcoholic is a person who has been chronically dependent on alcohol for several years, with all the phenomena associated with it, which does not occur in children.”
“In those who drink alcohol repeatedly, it is rather due to a systematically failed social or family environment,” Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n explains.
According to spokeswoman Jurinov<0xC3><0xA1>, this year in the pediatric clinic of Motol were hospitalized until mid-November forty drunk children.
However, the statistics only show those who come with a serious poisoning and must stay in the hospital.
Young drinkers who, after medical recognition, go home with their parents or with the police, do not count.
In addition to the cases in which children simply gather after school and drink aguardiente, for Pelikan there are three seasonal ups and downs that should be mentioned: the day of witches, the end of the year and the end of the school year.
"In such a circumstance, they drink for the bad notes or, on the contrary, celebrate the beginning of the holiday."
"On the day of the witches I have come to see in admissions up to seven drunk children at a time," adds Pelikan.
Drinkers who spend the night in detox under the supervision of doctors, paradoxically, have the advantage that the next day they do not suffer a terrible hangover at home.
Morning headache, caused by dehydration and lack of glucose, is prevented by the injection of a serum with glucose and with the nutrients that the body lacks.
"They take it much better, because after a hectic night, they get up well and it hurts them nothing."
“They are only confused about where they are,” Pelik<0xC3><0xA1>n says, adding that patients often lose their good mood at least when they see the expenses they have generated.
The transfer by ambulance and hospitalization in a room for serious patients costs about ten thousand crowns.
“I have often used the cost as a means of educating them, when on the visit I tell them directly to the children how much their drunkenness has cost and that they would have to spend all summer in a youth job so that you earn enough to pay that night,” Pelikan adds.
Health insurance, in his view perhaps as a regressive measure, which usually reimburses people for treatment costs, does not do so in the case of children who drink.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain
Two L-159s out of a total of five, for which the Czech Ministry of Defence replaced the Casa C-295M aircraft, departed for Seville on Tuesday, where the manufacturer of the Casa - EADS aircraft is located.
This is the first time such a device has been found in the hands of anyone other than the Czech army.
For the time being, they were only abroad to perform practice or demonstration flights.
It is the two-seat L-159T1 version, which until now used the Czech army and was still in flight.
The remaining three aircraft are the L-159 single-seaters.
These are still preserved in Aer Vodochody and the intermediary of the sale, the company Omnipol, already took care of them last week.
Jan Peje<0xC5><0xA1>k, of the defense press department, said it was not yet known when the planes would be physically withdrawn from Vodochody.
"The L-159 single-seat aircraft, on the other hand, were separated from the long-repaired aircraft, with no additional investment or input from the Ministry."
"The L-159T1 biplaces were exchanged in their current state," Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek told Pr<0xC3><0xA1>vo Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
He added that the army is not left without two-seat aircraft, since in May 2009 the army signed with Aer Vodochody a contract for an amount of 200 million crowns for the construction of four L-159 devices unnecessary for two-seaters.
One of the new planes already received the army in July, the other will be delivered at the end of the year.
According to Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek, EADS committed to adding aircraft to the equipment of some allied countries.
"The contract clearly states that the EADS company is the one that withdraws the L-159 aircraft and that they will serve for the practices of pilots from NATO countries."
“So it’s up to the buyer to decide how they’re going to use them in this framework,” Pej<0xC5><0xA1>ek says.
The newspaper Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny published earlier that, for example, the Spanish army is not interested in the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159s for one Casa aircraft and the purchase of three more aircraft for 3.5 billion crowns were approved last year by the government of Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek.
The Ministry of Defence did not call a tender for the purchase and negotiated directly with EADS.
The current Defence Directorate claims that the exchange promotes the future export of L-159 to foreign countries.
The Czech army acquired Aer 72 aircraft and only uses 24, so it wants to sell the rest.
The purchase of Casa aircraft is likely to have legal consequences.
The European Commission has already complained to the Czech Ministry of Defence before the European Court of Justice because it should choose aircraft by conducting a European tender and not by contacting a single manufacturer.
The army has already received three Casa aircraft and the last one should arrive at the Prague airport in Kbely in fourteen days.
A longer index finger than the ring finger indicates a lower risk of cancer
Men who have the longest index than the annular index are subject to a lower risk of prostate cancer.
This is the startling conclusion of a study published Wednesday in a British journal on cancer.
It could depend on the level of testosterone, the male hormone.
“Our results indicate that relative finger length may be a simple test of prostate cancer risk, particularly for men up to the age of 60,” said study co-author Ros Eeles, a professor at the Institute for Cancer Research at the University of Warwick.
Therefore, the finger could help determine which men should undergo a prostate cancer test, particularly if this feature is associated with genetic risk or other harmful factors, such as family health problems, Eeles says.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed up with a British peer of more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer and, simultaneously, 3,000 healthy men.
More than half of the participants in the study had the index finger of the right hand shorter than the ring finger.
They had the same odds of getting prostate cancer as 19% of those whose fingers were the same length.
For men with a longer index than the ring finger, this risk was reduced by 33%; for men under 60%, the reduction reached 87%.
The relationship between the length of the two fingers in question, determined in the prenatal period, reflects different levels of hormones to which the fetus is exposed in the womb.
A lower testosterone level corresponds to a longer index.
Previous studies have indicated that testosterone influences the development of prostate cancer.
The great Czech geneticist and former president of the Academy of Sciences, Professor V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Pa<0xC4><0x8D>es, told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that he knows the study, but does not think that the relationship between finger length and cancer can be "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic under snow: the D1 and D5 are closed
The Czech Republic, like most of Europe, was covered in snow on Thursday.
Roads and sidewalks are covered mainly by compact snow and snow removal machines circulated throughout the night in numerous areas.
In the morning, the D5 road between kilometers 89 and 93 in the direction of Rozvadov was closed due to several accidents of industrial vehicles and passenger cars, as was the D1 in Brno in the direction of Prague.
Las noticias las transmiti<0xC3><0xB3> el operador del <0xC3><0x9A><0xC5><0x99>entln<0xC3><0xAD> automotoklubu (<0xC3><0x9A>AMK).
A truck crashed on the 91-kilometer, and two industrial vehicles collided in the 93-kilometer.
Several cars also ended up in the ditch.
There are also problems on the D1 motorway at kilometer 185 towards Prague.
Two trucks collided there.
Drivers must drive slowly behind Brno on kilometer 190 or cross Brno and join kilometer 182 in K<0xC3><0xBD>valce.
Several kilometres of traffic jams have been formed there.
There has also been an accident on the D11 road, right next to Prague.
Prague is covered by a layer of snow of several centimeters and thermometers indicate -7 oC.
Obstacles are forming in Prosek, for example, although <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>rboholsk<0xC3><0xA1> is also congested.
The safest means of transport is the metro.
Trams run late, for example on the line between Karlovo n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> and N<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD> M<0xC3><0xAD>ru.
At eight in the morning, another state of crisis will occur in Prague.
The problems also affect the railways and the airport.
Due to the snow, the Czech railway company had to cancel seven connections for three fast.
The problems affect, for example, the line between Prague and Kralupy or Prague and Beroun.
Travelers should check what the current situation is.
Ruzyn<0xC4><0x9B> Airport was closed from eleven in the evening on Wednesday until five in the morning.
Currently, it can already be circulated on most of the roads of southern Moravia, but with extreme caution.
In Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovska three secondary roads are closed to traffic, in Brno snow tongues are being formed and in Blanenska chains are needed to access certain access routes to the highest points.
One of the most affected places was Vy<0xC5><0xA1>kovsko.
So far the connections are closed: Rousinov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Ku<0xC4><0x8D>erov and also <0xC5><0xA0>aratice - Mile<0xC5><0xA1>ovice.
Milling machines will be required to clear them.
At the moment, it is not known when it will be opened to traffic.
In Hodon<0xC3><0xAD>nska, caution is required in the Karpaty B<0xC3><0xAD>lé (White Carpathians) area.
Roads in the region, which, given that it is a protected natural area, should simply be left in an inert state, accumulate up to five centimeters of snow, according to <0xC4><0x8C>TK.
In the Czech Republic they fell between two and ten centimeters of snow, more in northern Bohemia, where the snow cover reaches 18 centimeters.
In the Moravian-Silesian region, about 15 centimeters of snow fell.
Snowfall is gradually returning to the Czech Republic.
U.S. Soldiers Have a New “Smart Weapon”
The US military is using a new “smart” weapon in Afghanistan, known for the time being only by the code name XM-25.
The generals expect the new rifle to influence the local conflict with the Taliban and to "change the progress of the game" to their victory.
The new weapons are like a small pistol and with an extremely precise aiming.
Their bullets are fired with a laser with a precision of several meters.
The special 25 mm caliber ammunition created for this rifle and the high explosive load it contains causes it to actually work like a small grenade.
Projectiles can be programmed to explode not only when they hit the target, but at any point in its ballistic trajectory.
They can be used against enemies who hide behind an obstacle, a wall or a trench.
Without a doubt, normal protection cannot be used and, when it throws its killer rain of metal chips, it can be essential in battle.
According to Richard Audette, who spoke about the development of the XM-25, the new rifle is the first infantry weapon to use “smart” technology.
"The soldiers manipulate it in such a way that they find the target, point it at its laser beam, which determines the distance, then obtains a precise point of view and, depending on it, corrects the projection line and tightens the trigger."
"Let's say they've measured 543 meters."
"When the trigger is pressed, the weapon is loaded and the projectile is launched at a distance of 543 meters, plus minus one, two or three meters," Audette says.
400 jobs are being relocated.
The Fujitsu consortium moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July of next year, 400 employees will change their workplace from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park.
The Japanese consortium Fujitsu moves its branch in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As reported by the computer giant and its maintenance on Wednesday, 400 men and women will move in July of the following year from their previous office building at Marienbader Platz in Bad Homburg to Astro Park, a large office complex on Lyoner Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e in the Niederrad district of Frankfurt.
A spokeswoman for Fujitsu explained that in the medium term another 100 employees of the consortium, who were previously spread throughout the region, will be housed there.
The offer is highly attractive, in addition the collective office in Astro Park will favor the way employees work.
In addition, Fujitsu will be the only tenant in Bad Homburg.
Director Bernd Wagner said, “In Franfkurt-Niederrad we have found a central location with excellent infrastructure.”
The bright connection to the airport is very important today for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new move of a major company in the region yesterday caused joy among those who were in favor and disappointment among those who were against.
Frankfurt's head of the economics section, Markus Frank (CDU), claimed that this has earned him a "Global Player".
This is a "magnificent recognition of the site."
Fujitsu sits in the city, the settlement is a big boost for Niederrad.
Bod Hombruger Mayor Michael Korwisi (Greens) regrets Fujitsu’s decision.
The management had earlier informed the city of their intention.
"Of course we have offered the company our help," Korwisi said.
However, the good contacts of the computer manufacturer with the owner of the property in Marienbader Platz have not been able to change in the difficulties.
After all, economic reasons led to the fall.
Thus, now there is a large empty place to cover in the famous post.
"I hope the owner and landlord of the building will show cooperatives."
The building previously used by Fujitsu in the Rathausplatz and the neighbouring "Kleine Vertikale" were part of the remaining Marienbader Platz buildings for ten years ago of a controversial project to build the seaside town.
As a joint project of the city and a private company of projects between the station and the town hall, a new entrance to the city is formed, which is in charge of the criticism regarding the massive building that previously used the voids as parking spaces and regarding the level of the buildings.
In 2001 the investment advisory and appraisal companies, the manufacturer of software for reservation systems, Start Amadeus, were installed, as well as then Siemens joined with the home computer manufacturer Fujitsu.
In 2006, the building used by Fujitsu was acquired by the Frankfurt real estate group Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen-Gruppe together with Morgan Stanley Real Estate and a year later resold to the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu consortium, based in Tokyo, is recognized as the world’s third largest IT provider.
It has companies, for example computers and servers, and also provides accurate services.
The branch in Rhein-Main-Gebiet is one of the largest in Germany, however Fujitsu has more businesses in Munich.
The Fujitsu Technology Solutions subsidiary is installed from Bad Homburg in Frankfurt-Niederrad, the following subsidiaries in this place will be Fujitsu Services and a company with the name TDS.
That's why 7,000 square meters have been rented out in the Astro Park office building.
The old complex of the twenties, its name alludes to its star-shaped plane, houses, among others, the central association of electrotechnics and the electronics industry.
Amazon cancels server - Threats against Assange
The anxiety is increasingly taking over Wikileaks.
The internet service provider Amazon has removed the disclosure platform from its server.
There may be political pressure behind the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic documents.
Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is reportedly under arrest in England.
The WikiLeaks disclosure platform is always the target of criticism, always stronger in the United States.
Internet activists lost access to their former American server and are currently looking for an internet homeland in Europe.
Former U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman calls on other countries and companies to boycott WikiLeaks.
And WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is on Interpol’s wanted list, must remain under arrest in Britain, according to an article.
"Wikileaks ejected from Amazon server."
"Speaking freely in the country of freedom," the whistleblowers said via Twitter's messaging service on Wednesday.
Earlier, the internet company, Amazon, had removed Wikileaks documents from its server.
Internet activists had resorted to the publication of secret diplomatic documents on the Amazon services website in order to cope with the high numbers of access to the documents.
On Twitter, WikiLeaks explained: “Perfectly, we will spend our dollars to hire people in Europe.”
If Amazon has problems with freedom of expression, “they should stop selling books.”
Amazon stopped using its server via Wikileaks after an employee of Senator Joe Lieberman asked for investigations, CNN reported according to a call to Lieberman's office.
The presidency of the Senate Security Council had threatened Amazon with a boycott, the British “Guardian” reported.
"I had hoped that Amazon would take these steps before, before the previous WikiLeaks classified information releases," he said.
Lieberman also requested that the platform also ban the use of the server in other countries.
“The illegal, monstrous and reckless WikiLeaks process puts our national security at risk and threatens life in the world,” the independent senator said in a statement.
“No responsible company, whether American or foreign, should help WikiLeaks with its service to spread stolen material.
WikiLeaks founder Assange, who is wanted in Sweden on suspicion of rape, is on Interpol’s wanted list.
According to an article in the London newspaper The Independent, the 39-year-old Australian is detained in Britain, Scotland Yard knows the exact location.
The internet activist has consistently labeled the investigation in Sweden as a plot of his enemy.
Wikileaks spokeswoman Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London that there have been threats.
"There were even calls about a Julian Assange murder."
That’s why Assange’s security is feared, Hrafnsson said.
Therefore, the location of the founder of Wikileaks remains undisclosed.
Hrafnsson evidently reacted to the statements of North America.
In America, the former Republican governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, claimed that the person responsible for the WikiLeaks revelations must be tried for treason and must be executed.
In Canada, said Stephen Harper, clearly ironically, on television, Assange should “be killed” and Obama could “use a drone.”
There is a growing dispute between the White House and Assange.
U.S. President Barack Obama’s spokesman Robert Gibbs called it “ridiculous and absurd” that Assange has called for the resignation of the secretary of state, in case she is responsible for ordering diplomats to engage in espionage tasks recently.
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about a guy’s opinion with a website,” Gibbs said.
“Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are much stronger than their website.”
The U.S. government needs to demonstrate the effectiveness of protecting its databases in general.
Russell Travers, deputy director of distribution at the National Counter-Terrorism Center, was named as the exceptional in-charge, the White House announced.
Travers is responsible for developing "the important structural reforms" that are needed in light of the WikiLeaks leak.
The White House also wants to inspect the roads, as well as change the full information about the government and protect it.
In addition, the U.S. government announced that to ensure the safety of dissidents and activists, they must jeopardize the publication of WikiLeaks.
“We’ve done everything we can to get in touch with them,” State Department spokesman Philip Crowley said.
"We are prepared to help protect them if necessary."
The University of Ice Cream
At Gelato University in Bologna, ice cream parlors are prepared at the best times of the year.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream parlors has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
Where does all the ice cream come from?
From the ice cream parlour and from the ice cream parlour.
The ice cream maker makes the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of ice cream making.
The ice cream maker takes the ice cream out of the counter with a spatula, spreads it over the boat and sells it.
To know this, it is not necessary to go to Anzola dell'Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But if you want to know more about ice cream, you should not visit the "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The manufacturer has equipped the ice cream university with the freezer in 2003, so that the ice cream cream of its machines meets the high Italian ideals everywhere.
The three-day basic course for future ice cream parlors has the maximum influx and visitors from all over the world.
There are also more special courses of more days on chocolate ice cream and practices in the ice cream shop of the house itself.
In these times of crisis, some dream of a new career, others risk their vague desires in the soft ice cream.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia through Hungary.
Jacky, a California art teacher, loves the slow movement of food and in the future wants to offer a quality European product in the land of industrial ice cream.
Anke, from Berlin, is a business consultant and wants to create something of her own in a few years within an annoying job.
Two young Egyptians dream of opening an ice cream parlor in Cairo.
A man from Malta and another from Brazil want to improve the ice cream quality of their bars, and a Canadian housewife, Julia, comes because her children love Italian ice cream.
The master ice cream maker Luciano Ferrari later explained to the participants the ideal qualities of the perfect ice cream.
It is decisive not only its good taste, but also its silky smoothness and its good consistency.
Luciano does not forget his training nor the cream cover of the national upper house and mainly of the south of the country: "Italian ice cream is simply the best, and that's why every ball has something romantic."
The first step in the process seems easy.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients: milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilizers into a large blender, which heats everything with an electronic program up to 85 degrees and currently cools it down to four degrees.
Then open the tap of the machine and a pasteurized white base cream comes out, the basis for all types of milk ice cream.
Suddenly, the professor asks: Can ice cream be made only with natural elements or without a blender?
How can one give free rein to some desire to experience?
Luciano advises that they part ways with the trends of the time.
The one who talks about ice cream "not only natural ingredients", has probably used stabilizers, mainly a natural product, probably guar gum, guar bean.
Of course you can make ice cream without stabilizer, you only have to buy it one day, place it in a bag and the customer will bite a loud granite ice cream.
Certain variations in the basic mass are allowed.
Aromas are used.
As for the taste of ice cream, the master Luciano distinguishes between the ingredients that are bought in the fruit section or in the candy section of the supermarket.
In addition, there are powders and pastes.
"All suppliers will try to paste flavored ingredients into their merchandise."
"But they must experience it sometime."
Either with fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even with the ice cream of the basic white mass, which with eggs will become a yellow cream and with cocoa powder as a basis for all possible chocolate pleasures.
Now the course participants can use the ice cream makers.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla ice cream, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut, with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less vanilla aroma or other natural ingredients.
They perform the same experiment also with types of fruit ice cream.
That you know better does not necessarily depend on it having more toffee aroma or more fruit puree.
It is not necessary for hazelnut ice cream to be dried if it contains more hazelnuts.
The working group elaborates the beloved kiwi ice cream, which uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer.
First, a balanced mixture highlights the flavor of the ice cream, Luciano says.
The making of ice cream is an artifact problem: You use peach puree with a lot of sugar, you need to lower the sugar ratio of the basic recipe.
For lemon ice cream you need an extra portion of sugar.
Luciano takes out a utensil with which he sets the amount of sugar of the types of fruits (measurement of the winemaker for Oechsle in the grape must).
Fortunately, the tables make the account easier.
Making ice cream requires nothing more than physical application, as before.
It not only helps the utensil for the automatic processing of the basic dough.
There is also a utensil, in which the prepared ice cream mixture is simultaneously beaten and cooled to a temperature below zero.
Despite everything, all the automation is left out in terms of the small pasta.
The Brazilian Gustavo stains himself and his companions from top to bottom with fruit puree, as if he were an uncontrollable mini-first giant.
“In all courses,” says Master Luciano, “it is only a matter of time before something like this happens.”
Inspectors in a Complicated Situation
The European food safety authority EFSA has infiltrated the industry experimenting with transgenic plants.
Currently this issue is formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which is considered an institute for independent assessment of the impact of biotechnology.
"It looks like a conspiracy theory but we haven't documented it well," Christoph Then, director of Testbiotech, said Wednesday in Munich.
Harry Kuiper, the director of EFSA’s expert group on genetically modified plants, and another EFSA expert have also been employed for years at the Ilsi association.
Consortiums like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer cost it.
Kuiper has significantly collaborated on EFSA’s testing standards for genetically modified plants, placing him in a clear conflict of interest.
EFSA’s provisions are in paragraphs with the same terms as the documentation of Ilsi’s situation and mimic the company’s writing, which is actually controlled by its Italian authorities in Parma.
This is the second time that Testbiotech has criticized a collision of interests.
Thus, recently, a high-ranking manager of EFSA went without the support or the transition time to the Swiss Agrarkonzern Syngenta, and has changed her side with that.
Recently, Mitteldeutsche Rundfunk (MDR) also revealed personal connections between EU inspection authorities and industry, which carried out the General Environment Office as well as an EU parliamentary clairvoyant.
However, EFSA cannot recognise any conflict of interest.
All formal data, including some industry data, provided they are of high technical quality, are ordered in a report.
Experts working at EFSA are not required to have any contact with the industry.
But they must expose these contacts.
Kuiper admits his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the US.
It calls itself a neutral forum for experts and science, industry and politics, among others for risk assessment for biotechnology without the commission of Lobby.
In this issue, independent experts, such as Then, criticize that currently allowed transgenic plants without researching food for animals and that the influence of genetically modified plants on the environment is not checked.
“We want to know what, for example, genetically modified maize does in agriculture,” says Then.
The current practice is to check only isolated proteins, but not the entire transgenic plant, which does not offer reliable results.
“If you don’t look for the risks, how are you going to find them?” asks the accuser, Then.
Angelina Hilbeck feels the same way.
She has been researching the field of genetic engineering since 1994 and currently works at the Technical Institute of Zurich.
In this area, the industry is increasingly trying, in the U.S. and Europe, to influence or discredit critical scientists.
Therefore, there are few scientists who are not influenced by consortia.
For companies, critical studies are not usually published.
“The industry controls security research,” Hilbeck says.
The Trail of the Stones
Uli Gsell has gained some, in total about 400 kilos.
On Monday I was in front of the Stuttgart station, with the Tuba behind me.
There were demonstrations
Nevaba.
The story is known: In September the excavators arrived and began to bring down a large piece of the north wing.
The land of Stuttgart was never the same again: Thousands and thousands protested against the s21, the suspension of millions at the station.
As it was sealed, most of the wing was made into rubble.
Route in 6,000, 7,000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a rough soft stone, erected between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern, he is 43 years old.
A couple of pieces have been secured.
"These stones are relics."
"They must not disappear."
He is enthusiastic: "A cheap and poor stone, simple and natural."
As he once said, it has smelled the smoke of cigarettes.
He still doesn't know what he's gonna do with the pieces.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell as well.
The Stuttgart stone trail leads to a forest in Tubingen in a former French Navy ammunition depot, where Manuel Rongen erected his Stein-Reich stone.
The 44-year-old man is dealing with ancient stones.
He has bought everything resulting from the demolition in Stuttgart.
“There would be dishonor, they would grind the gravel or send it to the dump,” says in her office, a wooden house that was once a guard house.
He was insulted and threatened, he explains, when, in September, he appeared in the newspapers, who had bought the remains of the north wing from the demolition company.
He talked to the enemies of the 21S for several days.
And he explained to them that he could do absolutely nothing about the shooting.
And when it happened, then it was most reasonable, when the stones continued to be used.
About 200 enemies of the S21 took the 80-kilogram cut deck, with a price per piece of 6.50 to 14 euros.
Some took it as a souvenir but also in the hope of being able to return it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had bought 500 tons, a load of 25 trucks.
About half is still in the forest, the rest has long since been sold.
Garden owner, landscape gardener, project manager.
They came from everywhere and took what they could take in the trunk and on top.
The Stuttgart stone of the impulse has long since become "the wall" or the delimitation of Kr<0xC3><0xA4>uterbeeten.
“This stone is really nothing special,” Rongen says.
"If it wasn't for the political component."
It ascends to its all-terrain, makes a tour of its great kingdom of 20 hectares.
He studied law, interrupted his studies, and later biology, interested in computers and finally worked with stones.
She is a lover of stones.
It is home to 4,000 tons of stone.
He transports his treasures all over Germany.
He says he's the country's biggest antiques dealer.
Brake.
In the snow there are artistic crushed sandstones.
"They belonged to the Dresden Marienbr<0xC3><0xBC>cke bridge," he explains.
Chalice alba, yellow, warm, gets excited.
"My dear stone."
The road crosses the forest.
Highlights: Red sandstone, an earlier piece of Karlsruhe station.
And go on.
"Beautiful travertine."
In the past, the mazes belonged to the tribune of the Neckarstadion in Stuttgart.
Everywhere in the snow, stones and stories, yellow travertine from the Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from the Sankt Blasien church, drum from the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what effort, what sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how he carved the stones before and moved them with a simple rig and a cart, he feels very devoted.
"It would be a scandal if something were destroyed."
He has not become rich at all, immensely rich.
But today 14 people had to do the dealer of stones, in addition to quarries, a sculptor, a blacksmith, a glassmaker and a gardener have settled up in the forest.
“We work hard, but it’s satisfying,” says the man in charge of taking advantage of the remains.
Soon he has to go to Cologne.
There are also stones to rescue.
The battle of talents around great potentials
Reigns an active influx in the buffet.
16 students squat around the buns, tomato soup and sweets.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and the car manufacturer Vokswagen have invited students of mechanical engineering and design to a workshop.
In a kind of idea contest, they have to talk about the car of the future with VW workers and also learn everything about Volkswagen.
Competing and in the same way, many companies, such as VW, come together in a hand-to-hand struggle around the most privileged minds in collaborations with universities.
Their mission: To hire as soon as possible the most talented students from universities, before they enter the labor market and are hired by others.
And because universities don’t provide publications on their students’ skills, they try to tap into exceptional talents in practical projects and capture them.
On the second day of the project at the Technical University of Braunscheig, the consortium wins over the talents.
A lady in the personnel department distributes pens, elbows and folders with the VW logo.
It explains to aspiring young talents the internship programs and student jobs and shows them their paths in the consortium.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig leads the project with VW.
See advantages for both parties: “Students come into contact with the industry and gain experience.”
“In turn, VW can get to know students, observe interesting candidates more closely, and consider them as potential future workers.”
Some collaborations, says Selle, are not uncommon.
The novelty is that students are wanted so directly.
“The main point previously was in the technical projects,” says Selle.
The fight for fresh graduates is getting tougher.
In many branches, companies can no longer choose their employees from a large group of applicants.
If not they have to be advertised and, above all, to get a highly qualified workforce.
All students in the engineering disciplines are in an excellent negotiating position.
According to the German Association of Engineers (VDI), there were 40,000 vacant engineering positions in October.
And, according to VDI’s forecasts, this vacuum of engineers will grow even more.
In the audit and advisory firm, KPMG, Roman Dykta is in charge of talent hunting.
It organizes expensive hiring events, such as the KPMG race, a type of modern yincan, in which participants have to find their way through GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight promising students to the U.S. next year.
In addition, participants can observe KPMG’s subsidiaries and learn about the company.
It is decided who should go in two rounds of choice at the start.
Only the cr<0xC3><0xA8>me de la cr<0xC3><0xA8>me of many participants goes to the USA.
Universities are increasingly striving to choose and polish the high potentials of universities, according to Dykta.
"With the race we want to stand out from the crowd."
"The simple journey by itself was short."
For the Dykta scouts the notes give results.
"To this day we have a similar action in the last year with all the participants."
“Some are nearing their end, and they want to apply to work with us,” he says.
In addition to the direct approach on campus, they are also hunting, especially small and medium-sized businesses, classic with their work fairs.
"We try to get students at the specialized fairs."
“Something about Intersolar,” says Sitha St<0xC3><0xBC>be, in charge of personnel for solar technology manufacturer Solarworld.
Bonner has approximately 1,500 employees in Germany.
St<0xC3><0xBC>be knows the problem of the new generation.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company's website.
“It’s very difficult to fill the vacancies.”
“It costs a lot of time and money,” he says.
A shorter path is contact with university professors.
Solarworld collaborates with several higher schools, for example, the University of Freiberg.
“Teachers advise that they can practice with us or carry out their theses.
There are no expensive advertising campaigns for solar specialists.
That’s why the company needs to be promoted with other advantages: Personal environment, flat hierarchy and comfortable communication.
“A large consortium cannot normally offer it,” says St<0xC3><0xBC>be, the head of staff.
In the search for a job, money is no longer the most important thing.
The decisive factors are flexible working hours, assistance to children or good chances of promotion.
According to a study by the Great Place to Work Institutes, Solarworld ranks 55th among Germany’s top 100 employers.
The institute draws up an annual list of the best German employment providers.
For what you ask the employee how satisfied he is with the work and with the environment in it and observes the previous conditions of the employees.
St<0xC3><0xBC>be, the staff manager also expects extra points in her ranking for her job seekers.
“I think the applicant is especially fixated on the external classifications of a potential employer,” he says.
Wolf Reiner Kriegler of the Deutsche Employer Branding Akademie advises companies that want a long-term strategy to gain a good reputation as employers.
It advises its customers more authenticity.
And that means, according to Kriegler, above all, internal measures.
“The best way to become attractive as an employer is through the employees themselves,” he says.
In the jargon of the sector it is called Employer Branding internal, also promotion of corporate identity within the staff itself.
“Satisfied employees are the best ambassadors.”
When you treat people well and identify them with the company, then you get promotion directly to the employer by friends and acquaintances.
“It’s like a gang game,” Kriegler says.
Obama halts new oil drilling
From the coast of the U.S. state of Florida to the Gulf of Mexico, no new oil drilling has appeared in recent years.
The Washington government issued a strong ban and thereby overturned its previous plans unappealably.
Also in front of the Atlantic coast remain new perforations sealed for the time being.
This was announced by Interior Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
What triggered this strict ban, which will at least be in place for the next five years, is the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig in April.
Before the disaster that cost the lives of eleven workers and caused the largest U.S. environmental disaster, President Barack Obama had admitted new drilling in the western part of the Gulf of Mexico under pressure from opposition and industry.
Supporters wanted to reduce U.S. dependence on new oil supplies from abroad.
To this day, it has not been fully clarified who is responsible for the irreparable black tide in the Gulf.
At the center of the criticism is the British energy consortium BP, which is facing millions of demands.
A commission of inquiry commissioned by Obama will present its findings in December.
In October, Interior Minister Ken Salazar lifted the drilling moratorium after the explosion.
Subsequently, various petroleum consortia submitted applications for further drilling attempts.
Obama and Salazar want to rule out a new catastrophe by employing tougher controls and tighter security regulations.
Currently, the responsible control authority, which after having been accused of corruption charges has fallen into disrepute, is reformed at its root.
In parallel, Obama announces that lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas consortia will be closed.
The industry publicly announces that total extraction in the Gulf will be lower thanks to tighter regulation, to date.
“The government’s plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industries,” says the result of the current survey conducted by the consulting firm BDO – ahead of Wednesday’s mining ban.
The American Energy Alliance complains of insecurity in the sector: “No one knows exactly what changes with regulation.”
Investments in new extraction projects are being extended for the time being, to the detriment of growth.
Ogonilandia is ruined
The water of the rivers is brown oil, smells like a gas station: Millions of liters of oil have destroyed nature in the Nigerian Ogonilandia.
People live off theft, corruption and illegal oil trade.
Celestine Akpobari likes it.
"Don't get tired," the environmental activist reassures journalists: "Today will pass enough oil in front of your eyes."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has managed to photograph boys wading in the water to the chest with the brightness of the lights reflected in turbulence on the surface: With the colorful glow of the water, the scene looks almost beautiful.
It is not seen that brown oil stains float on the surface.
Before here I used to pick up prawns in handcuffs, explains Esther Badom on the banks of the Bodo-Jetty River.
Meanwhile, the fluid waters are totally dead.
Five years ago, an impressive amount of oil was poured into the formidable wetland by a broken pipeline.
The fish around the small town of Bodo had to swim for six hours to reach fish-filled waters: That, in the heart of the Niger Delta and located in Ogoniland, is considered one of the most suffocated regions in the world.
On the path of the river that passes through mangroves, the extensive desolation is obvious.
Instead of clear water, the ship's engine removes a brown broth, which dips its hand in the water, will draw some full of oil.
The roots of mangrove trees rise from the ground like dark licorice sticks, sadly isolating the palm trees that crash and hang their palms.
In vain are sought flocks of birds, as if they were in the wetlands as always: As soon as the barrier of the outside is silenced, a kind of ghostly calm of an earlier paradise with a smell of gasoline expands in it.
"What's happening here is an ecological struggle," says Hurricane Celestine Akpobari. "We live in constant danger to health."
A war comparison is made.
The Ogoni settlement area has been a fierce battleground for years: here the first European explorers broke out more than 60 years ago, here the first resistance was organized in the 1980s with the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa, later executed, here had to place his first factory the Shell consortium in 1993, because it would be too dangerous for oil employees.
Even today, the return of the companies to Ogonilandia is prohibited: While they pumped daily more than two million barrels of black gold from the entire delta region, three times the size of Switzerland, with more than 5,000 extraction sources and 7,000 kilometers of pipelines, the oil fields in Ogonilandia were quiet, the location with too insorbable.
Every two hundred meters steel platforms stood out as bizarre water sculptures: "Christmas Trees" affectionately called to the heads of the drills.
They are up to 50 years old, most of them have total corrosion.
At every moment a head fails, says Akpobari, then drives a constant jet of oil into the water.
According to experts, more than two billion liters have been poured into the delta ecosystem in 50 years: Year after year, the amount of oil penetrates, as in the wreckage of the ship "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the Alaska Sea, one of the largest ecological catastrophes in human history.
Whoever is responsible for the sustainable environmental region will deal with it.
While the Shell consortium and organized oil thefts are responsible for more than 90 percent of the pollution, ecologists see heads about to break and leaky pipes as the main culprits.
In Nigeria, Shell applies mostly low safety standards normally in the world conventionals, scientist Richard Steiner reproached the consortium in 2008: Only pipe defect rates are “about a multiple higher than elsewhere.”
In one place, which from a distance seems forgotten, a workshop full of oil appears under the open sky, figures emerge from among the mangroves: They are naked and covered in oil.
Among one of the many barrels, which are sometimes attached to the perforations, sometimes arbitrarily scattered on the ground, a fire blazes: a small illegal refinery.
In the barrel, oil is heated in the fire for more hours, explains Michael, the head of the group.
First, the gasoline penetrates through the pipes in the container, later the oil pipe drips and finally diesel comes out.
In this way, Michael and four employees produce up to four 300-liter barrels of diesel daily: “It brings us 34,000 naira”, about 22 dollars.
The inhabitants of the delta take advantage of fuel shortages in one of the largest oil states in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
With the absurd and cheap diesel price of just 40 euros-cent per liter, illegal heaters can offer even less: Thus they reduce the value of their raw material.
It comes from "the bunkers", which called the pipeline network that passes through Ogoniland: According to experts, at this step at least 16 million liters of oil are lost per day throughout the Niger Delta.
Only a negligible part of the provisional stored raw material is clearly illegally refined: Organized criminal networks, to which politicians and senior military officials also belong, keep the best part in escalators and sell it cheaply in the world market.
The activist Akpobari considers the debate on whether the environmental catastrophe is due rather to the management of the population or to the loose mode of production purely academic.
“If the oil companies did not behave like invaders and did not completely destroy the natural habitat of the fish, there would be no sabotage, no theft, no illegal refineries.”
While the conditions of the Ogoni are mostly shattered by Shell to the point that only one deduction of the consortium appears: "Perhaps it is better to present another nationality, like China."
Michael gets nervous.
“It’s time for you to disappear,” says muscular <0xC3><0x96>lmann.
"Soldiers can come in any minute."
If the special army unit catches the illegal refiners, it does not threaten to arrest them, if not with a painful bribe.
The soldiers from the north also want, like all Nigerians, to take advantage of the raw material.
"This doomed invention has completely shattered our country," Akpobari said.
Researchers detect dangerous factory defects in A380 engines
Apparently, the A380 has a big safety problem.
In an investigation of a machine that made a forced landing, the researchers found a possible factory defect, which can produce “a catastrophic engine failure.”
The airline Qantas wants to sue the engine manufacturer.
Passengers on the Qantas Airbus that made an emergency landing in early November were much more fortunate than can be imagined: Australian air safety authorities, thanks to their investigations, perceived a major safety problem in the engines of some A380s, and warn of a possible factory defect.
The potential defect has complicated repercussions: In a hose connection, fatigue cracks or cracks can be caused, ATSB officials announced in a report released Thursday.
This could have caused “a catastrophic engine failure.”
This affected the engines manufactured by Rolls-Royce belonging to 20 aircraft of the A380 series.
Among them is the Qantas-Airbus that had to make a forced landing on November 4 in Singapore.
The Australian airline is taking legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
He filed a lawsuit in the federal court in Sydney that allowed for more legal action against the company.
Alan Joyce, director of Qantas, said his airline will claim compensation for the incident in early November.
In the brand of the engine have lost parts and its wing is deteriorated.
Rolls Royce distinguishes the type of gasoline as the cause of the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines from around the world have to be replaced.
The Australian researchers announced that they will conduct more safety tests on superjumps equipped with the affected engines.
The safety recommendation is the result of a collaboration with Rolls Royce, ATSB spokesman Martin Dolan said.
The security issue has become important enough to inform all those affected.
After the emergency landing of the Qantas aircraft, the airline kept its A380 fleet ashore for many weeks.
Singapore Airlines kept approximately three of its eleven A380s temporarily grounded.
Lufthansa refitted the engine of an A380 as a precautionary measure.
This double-deck aircraft is the largest passenger aircraft in the world.
A Nevada across the country causes traffic chaos
Totally white Germany: From one day to the next it has snowed almost all over the country.
In many streets chaos reigns, trains and planes fail.
At least three people have lost their lives in road accidents.
Germany’s winter ice: Almost all of the country reached freezing temperatures on Thursday night, triggering traffic chaos at many points.
In some parts of the north and east, there is a snow layer 15 centimeters thick.
Traffic is very limited on most highways and on many streets.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the snowshoes are in continuous operation, removing the new snow again and again, but it is not ready.
In addition, strong gusts of wind sweep the coast of the Baltic Sea.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency of Germany (BSH) expects live tides with water level 1.2 meters above its usual level on the Baltic Sea coast Schleswig-Holsteins.
In Saxony, snow accumulation caused considerable problems on motorways and on national roads.
According to the Meteomedia weather service, the red alert is called in S<0xC3><0xA4>chsische Schweiz, actually the highest alert.
There is partly 30 centimeters of freshly fallen snow and cold and strong winds take care of swirling it.
Many trucks and cars were trapped there during the night.
Also in Saxony Anhalt police authorities reported major disturbances in the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind paralyzed traffic and created traffic jams.
In Thuringia, snowfall affected the A4 and the A9.
According to Deutscher Bahn, major disruptions are expected in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt, Thuringia and northern Bavaria.
Snow on the road, trees falling on rails or broken catenary and holes are the main problems.
In Saxony, the intercity service from Leipzig to Nuremberg is suspended.
In Saafeld, Thuringia an ICE train had to stop its trip to Munich.
Firefighters and the rescue service attended to the 165 passengers on the train with blankets of wool, food and drink.
Winds with snow sweep the streets.
At Germany’s largest airport, the snowy winds caused numerous flight suspensions.
According to a spokeswoman for the flight information center, some cancellations have already been announced in Munich.
In Frankfurt am Main, according to a spokesman for Fraport, 40 flights have already been cancelled.
The snowplows are in continuous operation.
However, there are few stranded passengers at the airport, despite that there are 400 camp beds prepared for them.
In many streets on Wednesday afternoon there were already many accidents.
In the afternoon, a truck driver died in a collision with a train at a road junction in Ostholstein.
The driver suffered minor injuries.
In the vicinity of Nuremberg a similar accident occurred because of the snowy streets: Also here a truck was hit at a crossroads because the vehicle was stuck.
The driver lost his life.
On the train four passengers were injured, the route from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was blocked for this reason in the morning.
In addition, a 30-year-old woman died after her car overturned near Aschaffenburg on a slippery road.
Meteorologists have good news: The snow will be increasingly soft and dusty and therefore will swirl in gentle streaks.
But the wind will decrease.
Only the Baltic Sea will be affected by strong and fast winds.
It will certainly continue to be very cold, in some places up to 15 degrees negative.
Deusche Bank looking for a buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to separate itself from its symbol: According to an article, the financial institution is looking for a buyer for its office towers at its headquarters in Frankfurt.
The property could contribute up to 500 million euros.
Deutschen Bank recently set up its headquarters: Twin towers were modernized in the Frankfurt banking district; while bankers returned to their old workplace.
But now the financial consortium apparently wants to capitalize on the costs of renovating, and is looking for a buyer for the two skyscrapers, as the Financial Times Deutschland claims based on a spokesman.
The spokesperson does not name the reasons for the sale in the project.
"We always check whether it is appropriate to own the properties or sell them and then re-rent them," he said.
That’s why Germany’s largest credit institution is renouncing its company headquarters after a short period of time.
The bank acquired the twin towers in mid-2007 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>272 million from the investor of a home fund and then made the relevant arrangements.
The energy reforms reached a figure of approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would mean a lot of money for the bank.
Experts in this field calculate the value of the newspaper towers renamed "Greentowers" at around 500 million euros.
If the renovated buildings are sold in a bank fund or to an independent investor has not been disclosed at present, the spokesman said.
Thousands of mourners mourn the miners who died
In New Zealand, more than 10,000 people thought of the buried miners, who died after many explosions in a mine.
The bodies have still not been found, because security measures remain precarious in the place of disaster.
Almost two weeks ago there was an intense explosion at the Pike River mine near the town of Greymouth.
29 miners between the ages of 17 and 62 were buried in the mine.
A probe was introduced at the scene of the disaster, but it did not discover any signs of survival.
Due to the high concentration of toxic gases and successive explosions, no rescue equipment could be lowered for safety reasons.
After the second intense detonation, authorities and experts concluded that there was no possibility that the miners had survived.
The bodies have not been recovered to date.
Today, family and friends remember the deceased with a commemorative act.
Ten thousand people have changed with the bright sunshine in Greymouth on New Zealand’s southern island.
Be silent for two minutes.
In honor of the buried miners, 29 tables were placed with the helmets, lamps and names of the miners.
There were also photographs and personal items, under clothing and surfboards.
The flags flew at half-staff in front of the country’s government buildings.
New Zealand waited for the miners to return to the surface “from the depths of the earth,” New Zealand Prime Minister John Key told participants at the memorial.
"But they never came home."
He can’t assume his son’s death until he’s seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was buried in the mine.
Along with the president of the government and the relatives of the victims, many foreign diplomats participated in the memorial event.
In the first explosion on November 19, miners of British and South African origin were also buried.
Rescue workers began extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on the South Island of New Zealand.
As soon as the explosive gases have been extracted, the scorching temperatures inside the mine will begin to drop, Gary Knowles, the police chief, told reporters.
Damn it, warrior!
Does the gore fit into the art film?
Director Nicolas Winding Refn re-explores the boundaries of the genre with his epic "Walhalla Rising" battles.
In what audience will Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn have thought when shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
A single-eyed Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) frees himself from his tormentors and murders his enemies with near-superhuman struggles, sounds ideal for young spectators seeking bloody action, precisely because our hero likes to employ brutal methods to kill and tear his enemies' guts from their bodies alive when he is in a bad mood.
On the other hand, Unojo, as it’s actually called, doesn’t say almost a word throughout the movie and the other characters let themselves be carried away by at most one or two sentences or a couple of painful deadly screams.
Otherwise, they are silent and enjoy the beautiful and terrifying mountain landscapes of Scotland, which the backdrops offer to the Viking world of about a thousand years ago.
Rather ideal for grown-up filmmakers interested in existentialism and very calm camera movements.
When a movie has multiple audiences it’s a shame they can’t rule out each other.
Director Winding Refn considers his savages and the trilogy about the drug-trafficking hairstyle "Pusher" as a kind of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but stoically refuses to make his works for all audiences with some more humor in the mainstream or some less brutality of the art house.
A brain mass and popping guts can’t dissuade most fans of art cinema.
Most fans of the action die of boredom if Unojo takes a boat to Jerusalem with a troupe of violent Christian missionaries for interpretable reasons and gets stuck an eternity in the calm and fog before his team arrives in America and shuts down again there.
It is a pity that "Walhalla Rising" has not found a film distributor in Germany and is only released on DVD.
It is a calamity against the magnificent images, but also because, behind the presumptuous and bloody facade, a piece of sometimes exciting cinema is hidden, which deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or logical action, everything is atmosphere, a feverish dream transformed into film.
And that's why there's no escape for the spectators.
Refn tells himself just a moment of relaxation and his glacial images and the gloomy trance soundtrack make him a knot in his throat, above all, the incredible hatred, which from the hearts of the characters goes towards him.
Only a small blonde young man, who faithfully supports Unojo, retains something as innocence, everyone else is possessed by anger.
Above all, the one-eyed hero, whose motives are never explained, becomes at any moment a warrior out of hell for temporary enemies and allies, possibly the ambassador of the same devil.
It represents perdition, but perhaps only for those who are lost anyway.
"Walhalla Rising" is a mysterious film that can be hated and admired, to be angry, upset and surprised.
An experience.
Mysterious Earth Movements
The IAEA nuclear energy organization has new indications of a secret nuclear program in Syria.
The country refuses to comment on this issue until controls are allowed.
About midnight of September 5-6, 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious cubic building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates; the largest and closest city, 30 kilometers away is Dair as-Saur.
Its name appears in documents of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), it is about a reactor that apparently the Syrians built with the help of North Korea in the cube, hidden in a valley that exits the river.
According to information from the U.S. International Intelligence Service of the CIA of late April 2008, a current reactor was designed under the name of the vicinity of el-Kibar very appropriate for the production of plutonium, with which nuclear weapons are built.
In contrast, the technique serves little purpose other than that of the 1950s.
The CIA showed a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
They showed with a computer animation where the reactor components were before the destruction, which was a reduced copy of the North Korean model of the Yongbyon nuclear power plant.
They also showed photographs showing the building from nearby or from the inside.
Not long ago the reactor was in operation, he says, but it was still not equipped with fuel rods.
Today, three years after the bombing, it is hardly better known than at that time, the enigmas grew larger over time.
Former U.S. President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that prior to the attack the CIA was totally certain that the Syrians had built a reactor in al-Kibar, but that he saw little evidence that there was a “nuclear weapons program” in the country.
In Europe, several secret service agents prefer to be even more cautious and only speak of a “supposed reactor,” although they consider the CIA’s presentation “plausible.”
They lack solid evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how safe it was to have a reactor in front of it, a senior U.N. diplomat responded in the summer stoning that the IAEA has "enough material to ask questions."
The Syrians quickly cleared the rubble of the alleged “unused military building” and scoured the ground.
However, in June 2008, an IAEA team under the command of former Chief Inspector Olli Heinonen found traces of uranium in el-Kibar, which had been manufactured by humans.
In addition, the IAEA obtained satellite images of a member state of commercial sellers in the moments just after the attack, which must have a higher informative value than the CIA presented.
However, these photographs did not reach the market because an unknown customer, perhaps Israel, bought them exclusively.
Therefore, the IAEA cannot independently verify its authenticity.
Syria always hinted that it had never had a secret nuclear program or built any reactors.
Uranium came from Israeli weapons, Damascus explained.
The IAEA rejected it as implausible after particle analyses.
Damascus has since refused to discuss the matter, as well as satellite imagery.
In addition, the controllers are forbidden a second inspection in el-Kibar and entry to the ruins of the bombed building.
Israel, too, remains silent.
"We will never comment on it," Ehud Olmert, acting prime minister at the time of the attack, recently confirmed the official position.
Thus, the investigation of the case has not yielded results since June 2008 and "progressively becomes a serious credibility problem for the authorities", as a senior Western diplomat corresponds to a place at the IAEA in Vienna, finally is pending a serious violation of the non-proliferation treaty, which the IAEA oversees.
The IAEA considers three more teams as the key to progress in the clarification, which must be "functionally connected" to the alleged reactor, and others like these still exist.
The inspectors have not publicly disclosed until now what equipment they are dealing with, what functions they have, or whether they appear suspicious.
According to the newspaper S<0xC3><0xBC>ddeutschen Zeitung, the IAEA has designated Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariayah as interns, again derived from the proximity of the cities located.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) identified these locations and located a complex of buildings near Masyaf with satellite imagery, which is most likely one of the suspected objects.
Possibly located at or immediately next to a military base, Syria prohibits entry to all three locations to the IAEA.
In Vienna, Syrians are said to fear a record that the U.S. has asked the IAEA to spy on military plants.
Nuclear detectives were alerted about the equipment thanks to warnings from the US Secret Service.
Through satellite photographs, the IAEA has indications that material is being moved between the three locations and the cube to the Euphrates bank.
A senior Western diplomat in Vienna said at least one of the equipment could be “related to fuel production.”
But there is “no indication of sensitive activities,” neither of uranium enrichment nor of reprocessing; processes that are necessary for the construction of nuclear weapons.
The type of reactor is operated with uranium that is not enriched.
Where uranium should come from and where plutonium should be subsequently separated for bombs, for these central questions there are, at best, plausible assumptions.
There is also no doubt that the ruins, the valuable clues that can be recovered, are in all three places.
As the hundreds of cargoes from the ground trucks disappeared, no one has information about where the debris remains.
The IAEA considers unlikely the al-Tibni salt mine, located a few kilometers from el-Kibar to the other side of the Euphrates, which the Syrians recognized in 1998 for its suitability as a zone for radioactive waste.
Recently, Robert Kelly, the former IAEA inspector, linked her to the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
But the photographs from orbit show that the Syrians made land movements in the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested entry.
It may be a coincidence but it hardly helps to dispel the suspicion.
In addition, in the diplomatic sector, it is said that the IAEA has taken some months to develop an inspection plan there, which the Syrians would allow, to maintain possible military secrecy, only the deployment shows the magnitude of the interest of the inspectors.
Meanwhile, Damascus is also critical of this proposal.
Western diplomats in Vienna a year ago were reassured that the reactor was already destroyed, so the matter is not very urgent, for a couple of months, Glyn Davies, a type of U.S. ambassador fencing the so-called exceptional inspections, one of the most rigorous means that the Viennese nuclear authorities have to establish controls.
Yukiya Amano, the director of the IAEA, who is to propose these inspections, has spoken of "an option I am open to in the future", but is still hesitant.
This path is very risky: Most of the IAEA’s governing council is needed for this, and some of the 35 countries represented there are not exactly eager for an escalation.
On the other hand, as a diplomat reflected: "And what if in the end they find nothing?"
Love in the Time of War
There have been problems since Angelina Jolie began directing her yet-to-be-named debut in the summer.
She herself has written the script, a love story between a Bosnian and a Serbian.
Not much more is known about it, but this is enough for agitation.
The rumor is very persistent, the Muslim woman falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslav war.
Associations of Bosnian women have quickly protested, with which at the last moment they moved some planned shooting days in Sarajevo to Hungary.
The film has been shot in Hungary and in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic of the women’s organization of war victims wrote to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) for Jolie and requested a meeting with the actress, reported a Bosnian newspaper, Jolie is the UN High Commissioner for Refugees’ ambassador.
He is not a diplomat, weeks ago the women offered him a meeting in Hungary that he refused.
The meeting took place in Bosnia, Hasecic says.
There are no love stories in the rape camps, and Jolie’s position on the matter informs the victims enough about the script.
Her organization, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, has recommended that Jolie be removed as ambassador, the Guardian reports.
But what exactly did Jolie write for the scenes?
The Bosnian ministry of culture that read the script, gave permission after a strip and loosened a recording permit in Sarajevo, is not entirely clear why Jolie did not go despite everything.
The young author reiterates that she does not pursue political purposes with her film, she enters the Yugoslav conflict with great effort, she wants to show the horrible consequences of the war and give voice to all the parties involved.
Its content remains inaccurate.
A second synopsis of the film, which sounds quite different, circulates: The lovers were together before the war started and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is deported to a Serbian camp where he works as a guard.
What sounds considerably different is the variant "rape victim falls in love with torturer".
It is certain that Jolie’s film really begins before the war.
The pressure on her, Jolie says, is “unfair and based on misinformation.”
Currently they can achieve peace with Hollywood hackers: While the script continues on the network illegally, like many others before.
Nothing like away from here
This afternoon is finally going to be good for the Irish again.
No trace of grief
Instead, the home team dominates over its customers from Sweden, Finland and the US.
Fans shout with joy as high music rumbles, knocking the floor with their feet.
The Bailey club vibrates in Cork, because players throw themselves, and find, ping-pong balls to the beer glasses from a distance of three meters
The strange show is called "Beerpong", and the prize for the winner is 500 euros plus some plane tickets to Las Vegas for the World Beerpong Championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet guy, this quirky drinking game and discreet computer don’t really make good crumbs.
And the 26-year-old tries to have fun with that, distracting himself from the fulminating question, what the future holds for him.
The fun in Las Vegas is not in his plans, in January he will conduct a personal interview in New Zealand.
“I have a bad feeling,” he says.
"It's a long way from home and I still don't have a job there."
At least: His girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland, "from a gunman got the job of her dreams as an event manager, maybe it's a good sign," says the young man and smiles.
Due to poor prospects at home, two of Tanners’ three brothers have already sought luck abroad.
Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, her brother Colin currently works as an IT consultant in London.
Young people leave: On the island there are many families like the Tanners.
100,000 Irish will leave the country in the near future, economic experts and the social research institute ESRI in Dublin predict.
As of 2015, there are 200,000 emigrants.
A great loss for this small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants.
The forecasts are confirmed, comes a migratory wave comparable to that suffered the island in the eighties.
After a decade of progression that brought great well-being to the Irish, melancholy is now spreading.
The economic crisis confuses especially the young, well-educated Irish, for whom so far, everything is at an all-time high.
The loss of jobs and the social decline seemed absurd in the boom years.
Everyone needs to have money in abundance.
But three out of ten men and women under the age of thirty are unemployed.
In the Irish Times there are letters to the mass director of young emigrants, who complain that: "In Ireland everything sinks."
“There should be an uprising against politicians and bankers, but who can, goes and loses our country and with it an entire generation.”
"The last one to close the door."
Leanne Caulfield, a law student and president of the Irish Students’ Union, sees a bleak future emerging because the government is only engaged in montages and no longer offers future prospects to young people.
“They cut minimum wages, but they don’t have strategies to get new jobs,” the 20-year-old says.
Notice how your peers go from one unrehearsed practice to the next.
His biggest concern, he explains, is having to emigrate in four years.
"This idea is sad and depressing."
People like Stephen McLarnon try to see this topic in a positive way.
McLarnon organizes the "WorkingAbroadExpo", a fair that offers a service around the topic of working abroad.
“For those who start working, doing it abroad is an excellent opportunity, the first steps to directing your career,” says the manager.
On their website there are photos of a boy surfing in Australia and another snowboarding in Canada.
The message is clear: Working abroad is not like doing it in the galleys, if not it brings freedom and fun.
For half a year now, Se<0xC3><0xA1>n O’Donovan knows what it’s like to build something somewhere else.
Since there was nothing left to do for the 29-year-old engineer, he currently works with 15 Irish colleagues on construction in Germany.
Now they're building a fashion store in Gelsenkirchen.
In January he goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
O'Donovan sees his homeland only a few times because he works overtime to pay for a loan for his home in Ireland.
“The situation is a bit crazy,” he says, since it was a long time ago that he stepped the threshold of his house.
"I make money in Germany for a house in Ireland, where I'm never so good."
He laughs a little embarrassed and goes to cold rooms.
The small house is in an elegant residential area with manicured gardens in front of the houses, at the entrance are parked large and expensive cars.
O'Donovan bought the house together with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros, 100 per cent financed by a loan.
“It was crazy times, there was easy money without a lot of questions,” he says.
Are you afraid of failing with credit?
O'Donovan thinks for a while, serves more hot tea and says, "I don't have kids to feed and I'm young; if everything goes wrong, I can start from scratch."
The civil engineer doesn’t like the complaints he often hears nowadays.
“No one should go hungry, our situation is not, by any means, as dramatic as in times past here on the island,” he says.
“Working a season abroad isn’t the worst thing that can happen, maybe that makes us feel like Irish for the first time.”
He laughs and tells of his father, who in the last great economic crisis went to England.
"After seven years he came back and life went on in Ireland, very simple."
Cian Tanner likes these ideas.
Let the future hang in the balance and just see what life is like elsewhere.
He’s been working in London for a couple of years now, and why wasn’t he and his girlfriend doing well in New Zealand?
But these days there is one thing that worries him greatly: the celebration of his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
He's afraid he might degenerate into a farewell party.
“Just, not too many emotions,” he says and gives his beer a big drink.
"Good-bye, sounds very distressing."
"Better we call it a marching party, very relaxed, with a couple of friends, a couple of drinks, a couple of games."
The Democratic Routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase, as well as support for private companies.
Crime is more of a concern than unemployment.
In addition, in much of the region, Brazil is seen as a more influential country than the United States.
These are some of the findings of the latest Latinobarometer survey conducted in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the survey has been conducted regularly since 1995, it allows monitoring of changes in attitudes in the region.
The results of this year’s survey, conducted in September and early October, highlight two related issues.
The first is the relatively lively humor reigning in Latin America.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Support for democracy has increased considerably in several countries on the Pacific coast of South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached an average of 6 per cent annually since 2002, support for democracy has increased from a reduced 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent this year.
It also grew in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after suffering a large drop in production last year.
However, only half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the area, are convinced Democrats, which lowers the regional average (see Figure 2).
About 44 per cent of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy works in practice in their country, the same figure as last year, but considerably higher than the 25 per cent recorded in 2001 (Figure 3).
About 34 per cent said they trusted their country’s Congress and 45 per cent in their government, the same amount as last year in both cases, but considerably higher than in 2003 (17 per cent and 24 per cent, respectively).
A decade ago, economic turmoil in Latin America severely affected support for democracy.
The fact that it has been maintained during the global financial crisis is probably due to the fact that many Latin American countries were only affected by a brief recession and enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, the existence of a stronger social safety net has helped to protect the poorest.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty only increased marginally in 2009 and has fallen again this year, to 32 percent.)
However, the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see Figure 4).
Brazil’s good economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz In<0xC3><0xA1>cio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a general sense of progress.
Such sentiment is less common in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crimes have increased.
For the second time since surveys began, more respondents in Latin America cite crime, rather than unemployment, as the most serious problem facing their country (see Figure 5).
About 31 per cent say they or a close relative have been victims of crime in the past year, down from 38 per cent last year and the lowest since 1995.
The most positive economic returns are reflected in increased support for private companies and the market economy: about 71 per cent of respondents in the region say that private companies are indispensable for development, while in 2007 it was only 56 per cent (see Figure 6).
About 58 percent agree that the market economy is the only system that will allow their country to develop, up from 47 percent last year.
Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela say the same (and 80% support private companies), although their leftist president, Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, is expropriating numerous private companies.
Brazil is the country with the highest leadership in the region, as indicated by 19% of respondents (compared to 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, the same figure as last year) and Venezuela (9% versus 11% a year ago).
However, the United States is considered the most influential country by respondents in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela holds such a title in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Elections in the Garbage
No one expected the general elections held on November 28 in Haiti to be perfect.
However, they were far worse than the foreigners who were afraid to help the country to recover from its problems.
Votes were cast in the polls, some people voted several times, ballots were thrown into the sewers, electoral colleges destroyed and acts of intimidation.
Electoral colleges opened with hours of delay.
Numerous Haitians, including groups displaced by the January earthquake, roamed the area trying to figure out where to vote.
Some of them, in the end, gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several of the most popular, denounced fraud and called for the election to be annulled.
The protests, some of them violent, spread across the country.
However, Edmond Mulet, the highest-ranking United Nations official in Haiti, declared that they were “a relatively good election in many ways.”
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community cautiously stated that “we do not believe that these irregularities, however serious, necessarily invalidate the process.”
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which according to its opponents is committed to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president, and his candidate, Jude Célestin, should announce the preliminary results on December 7.
The tie-up is expected to take place in January.
Not all hope for the elections has yet been lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rapper, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have withdrawn their initial petition seeking the invalidation of the vote.
But problems can still arise if the electoral authority declares that Mr. Célestin, who barely has support, if he has any, has moved on to the second round.
Given that the cholera epidemic is sweeping the country and more than a million earthquake survivors are still living in stores, a major abstention is expected.
When the time came, many Haitians wanted to vote, but failed to do so due to a lack of organization.
About 250,000 identity documents, needed to vote, had not yet been distributed shortly before the election.
There's a lot at stake.
Aid donors consider the election of a legitimate and popular government to be an essential step in Haiti’s reconstruction.
And, as it has become evident, so do the Haitians themselves.
Moving from pointers to center
In the weeks since losing her husband, Cristina Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, the president of Argentina, has enjoyed a great sympathy among the public that has increased its popularity index by 20 points, to more than 50%, the highest level it has recorded since its election in 2007.
Despite everything, whether it can turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in next year’s elections will depend on whether the clearly affected Mrs Fernandez leaves aside the intransigence of her late husband, her predecessor and political partner, Nestor Kirchner.
And, at this point, the indications are inconclusive.
Mr. Kirchner, who was still in charge of economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, had the habit of drawing up budgets that undervalued tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the presidential marriage to spend the additional income at its discretion.
In theory, Mrs. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez’s government lost its majority in Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided, a situation that has worsened after Kirchner's death due to a heart attack on October 27.
Some dissenting members of the ruling Peronist movement have clashed with Mrs. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
However, after chaotic sessions in which one MP punched another in the face and other MPs accused the government of bribery, Congress decided to reject the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to argue," the president said.
The 2010 budget, therefore, will be implemented in the coming year, which will offer the President an even greater margin for action when it comes to spending it.
The economy is improving considerably: it is likely to grow up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is currently at 11.1%, but numerous private calculations, in addition to the wage demands of the unions, place it at about 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took power in 2003 when Argentina was on the verge of economic collapse, made growth and poverty reduction his priorities, rather than controlling inflation.
He refused to negotiate with the IMF, pressured the private sector and had INDEC, the statistical institute, adjust official inflation statistics.
Will President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez moderate these policies now?
It has convened meetings between the private sector and trade union leaders.
In addition, its officials say they want to limit wage increases to 18% next year.
The economy has been driven by the high prices of Argentine agricultural exports in the world.
However, inflation has limited the growth momentum achieved with a large devaluation in 2002.
Perhaps that is why Mrs. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is giving signs of wanting to restore Argentina’s financial ties with the rest of the world.
At the beginning of the year, the government reached an agreement with bondholders who had refused a previous forced restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid in 2001.
At present, it seems that Mrs. Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is about to enter into an agreement with the creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which she owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this would not involve IMF supervision, as is usually the case.
However, last month Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Fund will offer "technical assistance" to develop a new index of prices to national consumption, which seems to be the prelude to the clean-up of INDEC.
It is unclear whether President Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez wants to remain in politics when her term ends, given that she no longer has her husband by her side.
If he does, he will need the support of the middle class, much of which has grown tired of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentines return from their summer vacation in March, the wave of sympathy for her will have waned.
If you want to win other elections, you will have to decide whether or not to repudiate, with peace of mind, many of your husband’s policies.
Middle Hurrah for China
Voters in Taiwan are slowly approaching a kind of closer union with the continent.
What does Taiwan think of its big brother on the other side of the strait?
More than 7.5 million voters, 70% of the eligible, turned out on Nov. 27 to elect mayors and councilors from five urban districts in what appears to be an extensive assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Mr. Ma himself has become a proponent of sentiments across the continent, forging innovative business ties, including a partial free trade pact, the biggest change in relations with China since 1949.
Mr. Ma passed the test, but little by little.
Although his Kuomintang (KMT) party ended up winning three of the five mayoral elections, it failed to get the majority of votes.
Instead, the Progressive Democratic Party (PPD), which has leaned for full independence from Taiwan, garnered nearly 50 percent of all votes against 45 percent of the KMT.
If it had been the presidential elections, Mr. Ma would be in trouble.
Since his election two years ago, his party’s share of votes has declined by about 8%.
For the first time, the PPD tied with the KMT in the city councils.
In the elections you could see the typical elements of the Taiwanese elections, including noisy campervans and large crowds with banners and light girls dancing in clothes.
There was also a mysterious attempt to assassinate him.
Sean Lien, the son of Lien Chan, honorary president of the KMT, was campaigning for one of the KMT candidates the night before the election.
A man in the crowd shot the young man directly in the face, wounding and killing a passerby.
The curious thing is that it has not been possible to determine whether the man intended to harm Lien or take revenge on the candidate.
In any case, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the PPD, the shooting affected the elections, planting suspicions about the PPD and causing voters to lean towards the KMT.
Perhaps the only major winner of the campaign was China.
It was surprising that it was not about the continent itself.
Instead, the candidates talked about public housing plans and job creation.
Taiwan normally enjoys its de facto independence and detests China’s military threat.
As a result, the KMT usually avoids advertising its links to the government in Beijing.
But this time the PPD also avoided encouraging sentiment against China.
It responds to the new awareness that Chinese trade is essential to Taiwan’s economic survival.
For his part, Mr Ma claimed that his policy towards China had been confirmed to be acceptable to the majority of Taiwanese.
The Beijing Government is expected to continue to bribe them with trade, in line with its strategy to bring Taiwan back into the fold.
China did not waste time sending a negotiator to Taipei to prepare a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Without a doubt, he would also like to achieve political integration, but the first is the first.
The best thing to do is to wait for the 2012 presidential election to happen.
In any case, the PPD has been reinvented.
Two years ago he was in a bad situation: his former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was jailed on corruption charges.
The President between 2000 and 2008 openly instigated explicit independence.
However, under the leadership of Mrs Tsai, a new generation of moderates has emerged and the PPD is striving to attract professionals and young people.
Ms. Tsai has been welcomed as a PPD candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Chen.
Now his party is doing everything possible to prove that he can also have relations with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans to set up an expert group to act as a point of contact between the PPD and China, as long as negotiations can take place without preconditions.
Ms. Tsai tells the Taiwanese public that her party represents a “reliable alternative” to Mr. Ma’s hasty approach to China.
Mr. Chen seems furious about the change.
In a statement issued from his cell, he claimed that PPD candidates would have been better off if they had insisted that Taiwan is an independent country.
He even ordered Mr. Su, a pragmatist, not to run for president.
Even without Mr. Chen’s intercession, the PPD will have difficulty choosing among its possible candidates.
The KMT must also take a conscience test.
Mr. Ma’s ratings have been poor, despite impressive economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
Its lack of popularity seems to be mainly due to unemployment and the growing differences between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says he will restructure his cabinet as well as local teams.
Large PPD samples suggest that Taiwan’s support for a rapprochement is limited.
At the same time, most Taiwanese consider economic integration with China to be inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a well-known columnist, "the point of no return has already been crossed."
Grammy Nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is the surprise choice in the category of Reveal Artist.
Act at the request of a president and possibly people will look at you.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old bassist and jazz singer personally selected by President Obama to perform at his 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, was one of the Grammy surprises this year with a high-level nomination in the category of Best Artist Revelation.
Given that Spalding has been an acclaimed jazz figure since his 2008 album, "Esperanza", the nomination gives a lot to think about, but respects the rules of the Grammys according to which he must be an artist who has not released more than three albums before recording the one that "determines the public identity of that artist".
His ambitious 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society", was certainly a breakthrough and, given his light and pleasant vocal style, as well as a great skill with influences from pop, funk and Latin rhythms, you can at least make a distinction between Spalding and the path to success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for Grammy voters, which is ultimately concentrated in the arena.
In the remaining categories, Grammy voters rightly honored Vijay Iyer Trio’s “Historicity,” an exciting and magnificent record that was one of the favorites last year.
Iyer's competitors include veteran saxophonist James Moody with "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley for "Positotly."
Trombone Shorty, a strident New Orleans favorite and regular guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which for the rest leans considerably toward fusion as in the Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber albums.
The wild punk of Darcy James Argue's Secret Society earned well-deserved recognition in the big band category, competing against the great chamber jazz of the Billy Childs Ensemble and the ever-risky Dave Holland, whose live album with his octet, "Pathways", was a great example of the bassist's democratic leadership in his band.
Grammy Award Nominations: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey for Best Classical Direction
Nominations in the field of classical music for the 53rd Grammy Awards include a mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The main nominations were for Michael Daugherty's five-movement piano and orchestra for "Deus Ex Machina", and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse", a work for three-movement eclectic orchestra.
Among the nominees with ties to Southern California are Estonian composer Arvo P<0xC3><0xA4>rt for his Symphony No. 4, "Los Angeles", a piece commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and premiered at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Los Angeles-based composer Avner Dorman is also nominated for his Mandolin Concerto.
Classical music nominations are divided into thirteen categories covering orchestral, opera, choral and solo albums.
The Classic Producer of the Year category includes five nominees: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin, and James Mallinson.
The nominees for the classical music album are Bruckner for the Symphony No. 3 and No. 4 of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of the Nashville Symphony Orchestra; Steven Mackey for "Dreamhouse" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; and the "Sacredi" of the "Sacredi" of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and the "Symphony Vocals" of the "S".
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg for "Lulu" from the orchestra of the Royal Opera House; Adolf Hasse for "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Kaija Saariaho for "L'Amour de Loin" from the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin; Rodion Shchedrin for "The Enchanteder" from the National Opera House; and The Enchanteder of the Choir.
The composers nominated for a Grammy for contemporary compositions include P<0xC3><0xA4>rt for Symphony No. 4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Passionately Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer".
P<0xC3><0xA4>rt’s Symphony No. 4 premiered at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a session recorded by the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The 30-minute piece, nicknamed “Los Angeles,” is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, imprisoned in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" is nominated for instrumental solo performance with orchestra.
The Los Angeles-based composer wrote the 15-minute piece specifically to be played on Avi Avital mandolin, who performed the concert with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
"He composed it with sounds from the Middle East and numerous scales and rhythms from North Africa," Dorman said in a telephone interview.
Director Pierre Boulez, 85, was nominated in the orchestral function category for conducting the Chicago Symphony Orchestra during a recording of Stravinsky's works.
Nominated instrumental soloists include pianists Nelson Freire and Marc-André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; violinist Julia Fischer; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
The nominees as vocal soloists are all women this year: Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonov<0xC3><0xA1>, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mix category, soprano Jessye Norman was nominated for her recording of "Roots - My Life, My Song."
The proposed mosque in Temecula gets the approval of the organizing commission
The mosque project for Temecula has garnered unanimous support from the local ordinance commission after more than five hours of public testimony, often heated.
Critics attacked the project by saying it encourages terrorism and obstruction.
However, commission members decided Wednesday night that the new religious center respected local legislation and would be impressive from an aesthetic point of view.
"Many good people came to show their support, whether Christians or Jews or Baha'is, of all religions," Hadi Nael, president of the Islamic Center in the Temecula Valley, said Thursday morning.
"The truth is, as an American citizen, I am proud."
"It shows that justice prevails."
“The opposition is really minimal,” he adds.
“They just talk too loud.”
"There are wonderful people in this valley."
The meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted almost until midnight; most of the time was devoted to people who interceded for or against the center, roughly the same amount on each side, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
"The United States no longer exists," reads one of the comments.
"This is another Planet of the Apes with Mrs. Liberty dead in the sand."
“America has fallen.”
Plans to build Islamic centers have also sparked protests in other parts of the country, including near zone zero, the New York area where the September 11, 2011 attacks occurred.
In the Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced acts of violence.
His congregation of about 135 families has been living together smoothly in Riverside County for years, but he wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse he rented on a shared property with a water filtration system manufacturer.
The new 24,943-square-foot mosque, with a Mediterranean architectural style, would include two minarets and would rise to 43 feet.
It would occupy an area of 4.32 acres on Nicolas Road, about two miles east of the Chaparral Institute.
Opponents can still appeal the project to the City Council.
Arsenic-resistant microbe poses the possibility of new life forms on Earth... or elsewhere
The discovery of a strange bacterium that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients expands the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly on other planets.
Although the researchers discovered the curious bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that there may be life forms without the main elements they considered essential.
"This organism has a double capacity."
"It can grow either with phosphorus or with arsenic."
“That makes it a very peculiar thing, although it lacks little to be a really ‘alien’ kind of way of life,” said Paul C. W. Davies of Arizona State University, co-author of the report that appears in the online edition of Thursday’s Science publication.
For a long time, it has been considered that there are six great essential elements for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
However, researchers have found that the bacterium, found in Mono Lake, California, can continue to grow after replacing phosphorus with arsenic.
“It makes you wonder what else is possible,” said Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
According to Anbar, the finding is important for the search for life on planets other than Earth, since researchers need to be able to recognize life, know what it looks like.
The study focuses on a microbe discovered on Earth.
However, the call for a press conference to discuss it, in which no details of the discovery were released, generated much speculation on the Internet about the possibility that the report indicated the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
He didn't.
What the discovery “does show is that in other planetary environments, there could be organisms using other elements to boost their biochemistry and that the set of “standard” elements we consider essential to life may not be as fixed,” said Charles Cockell, professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute, Open University, in Milton Keynes, UK.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
"This work is novel because it demonstrates the substitution of one element for another in basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added.
The discovery was not made by chance.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of NASA’s Institute of Astrobiology, who led the study, focused on Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphorus are similar from a chemical point of view, so he speculated that a microbe exposed to both could replace each other.
“Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is similar to that of phosphorus.”
“Consequently, it can be difficult for organisms to differentiate them.”
“However, arsenic is different enough that it doesn’t work as well as phosphorus, so it goes in and, to put it another way, it cripples the biochemical machinery,” Anbar explains.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed them to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which they managed to adapt to and use to grow.
The microbe grows best with phosphorus, but the fact that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that there may naturally exist a way of life that uses arsenic, either in other areas of the Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is most common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be substituted for phosphorus is not new, but an example has never been found to prove it works.
Arsenic was more common in the early ages of the Earth, he noted, so researchers speculated that early life forms may have used it.
“So it suggests that there could be other ways to generate life, not just the way life was formed on Earth in the past,” said Foster, who was not part of Wolfe-Simon’s research team.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
The dogs that were missing in Compton have been found
The two missing dogs were found in front of the Bellflower Motel, Los Angeles County Sheriff’s officials said Thursday.
The four competition dogs, two Akitas and two Welsh Corgi Pembroke, disappeared Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express pickup truck they were spending the night in, in front of the Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
Two of the canines recovered on Wednesday afternoon and the remaining two were found late on Wednesday evening, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
“The good news is that dogs are fine,” Whitmore said.
“They are in good condition.”
"They're back with their rightful owners."
Whitmore did not want to indicate exactly where the dogs were found, in which neighborhood, or the circumstances of the discovery.
“An investigation is underway.”
"We don't want to say anything," Whitmore said.
“We’re following some clues.”
The owners of the dogs, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be found to comment on Thursday.
They met with their two Akitas at a county animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
The sheriff's deputies found the van and the two dogs separately in Compton.
According to authorities, the Akitas (Trace, a 3-year-old dog, and Didi, a 10-month-old dog) had not been harmed.
But Bunny and Peter, the Corgis Rickard and Peek intended to exhibit in the area's competitions this week on behalf of the Japanese dog owners, remained missing until Wednesday night.
Peek and Rickard, who live in Redding, were in town for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend and intended to exhibit Trace.
The other dogs were going to exhibit them in other competitions scheduled for the days leading up to the AKC/Eukanuba championship, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one of the stops on the almost two-month tour that the couple takes part in canine competitions.
On Monday night, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
They usually stay in motels and park the van right in front of their room window.
They carried three other dogs (a boxer’s cub, a Parson Russell terrier, and a Brittany) who slept with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and Corgis in the van because they have very thick fur and would be cooler.
They left the windows slightly open so that the dogs could breathe fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the theft of the van at 6 a.m. on Tuesday.
Peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could drive them to the Corgis, equipped with microchips to identify them.
On Thursday, it was unclear whether a reward would be given or not.
The lion is ready to roar again, while MGM restructuring gets final court approval
After 18 months of confusion and uncertainty, MGM has finally gotten the green light to start all over again.
On Thursday, a New York federal bankruptcy judge officially approved the “pre-armed” plan by creditors to wipe out approximately $5 billion in debt, paving the way for the 86-year-old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and debuting movies and television shows.
The ruling on Thursday confirms that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, so there are no other legal obstacles for MGM to relaunch itself under the founders of Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become the top executives of what will be a reduced study.
The staff will be reduced from 400 to approximately 320 members.
In reality, MGM will not leave Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes a planned $500 million credit instrument, to fund the operations and productions of the new MGM.
The investment bank is currently syndicating the loan, which on its own is contributing $75 million, and is expected to be funded in mid-December.
The study’s restructuring process began in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis and Co. was hired to give advice on the management needed to order its finances, while struggling to make interest payments of $300 million a year.
In August, Director Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former President of Enron and expert in the recovery of bankrupt companies, known for his work on Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper’s attempts to resolve MGM’s financial tribulations and satisfy the study’s more than 140 creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, in late 2009 the parties agreed to put the company up for sale.
However, the auction attracted few bidders and none willing to pay the more than $2 billion sought by creditors.
Before spring this year, he returned to the design table as the MGM team began work on a restructuring plan that, after months of debate and internal disagreements, was finally backed by creditors in late October.
When MGM officially exits bankruptcy in the coming weeks, the companies of Moelis and Cooper will receive multi-million dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis and Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will receive a payment of $9.5 million.
Cooper’s companies, which have been raising $375,000 a month for their company’s management services, will receive a “success fee” of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum plan to resume production on MGM, which released just one film this year, and put together an annual seven- or eight-film slate that will be released in 2012.
They also plan to co-finance two films based on “The Hobbit,” along with Warner Bros.
The studio needs to arrange a separate loan of between 265 and 275 million dollars to finance its share of those two films, which will be directed by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM’s debt, had been trying to arrange a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, the recent talks between the two companies did not result in an agreement.
Tech Toys wants to keep the balance of its gift budget
While the iPad is the top contender to be this year’s most wonderful toy, followed by perhaps the Microsoft Kinect video game system, both can mean a significant dent in your gift budget.
Consider that for the price of an iPad you can buy five BMX bikes for $99 each, and a Kinect game costs the same as 10 classic jump ropes adorned with beads, or about 48 cans of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your gift budget in balance.
I recently visited three domestic toy sellers, Wal-Mart, Toys "R" Us and BJ's Wholesale Club, to see what electronic toys I could buy for under $80.
It was immediately clear that Moore’s Law has been working; this year’s tech toy will likely have more power, costing the same and even slightly less compared to last year’s.
Also, while there are generally fewer new toys with associated websites, two of the best-known ones of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more offers.
And button battery-powered toys are on the rise, as are toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, unless otherwise noted.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for 3 years and up) are stuffed toys the size of a guinea pig that sing a note when their bellies are squeezed.
One press equals one note, and a second press begins to put together a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start to squeeze, you can’t stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $60, for 2 years and more) is the best option.
Borrowing from last year’s Elmo Live technology, the 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-shifting games like Sim<0xC3><0xB3>m Dice, and can make the lunar pass, thanks to its innovative wheel-jointed feet with locking device.
The children who tested the toy used Mickey as a dance instructor, although his parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you’re an 80’s kid, you might remember Alphie, one of the first computerized educational toys.
He has returned (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for 3 years and up), with a backpack full of question cards designed to turn a car ride into a session with a notebook of self-correction exercises occurring.
If you are wary of giving your child your smartphone, here you will find three independent alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, 3 to 8 years old) is the cheapest and easiest to use, featuring a qwerty keyboard; although games don't teach as effectively as the Leapster Explorer ($70, 3 to 12 years old), it is the first major upgrade of the Leapster line, with a newer and brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price’s iXL ($90, ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-like system for presenting games and e-books, and has an SD card slot that lets you view family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for 8 years and over) is a five-block game just bigger than a box of matches, each with its own LED display.
The goal is to put words together by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out; it’s great for an impromptu word-for-word contest.
There are more and more toys that have some kind of online connection.
Based only on their toy presence, the two biggest ones are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child an online pet at Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, ($5, 6-12 years old) that includes a coin with a hidden code.
When you redeem the code online, your child gets enough credits in the Club Penguin store for two items.
These could include roller skates or a Puffle pet toy.
Slightly larger than the bristle of his toothbrush, Hexbug Nano ($10, for 5 years and more) is the latest in a line of button-powered microrobots.
The false insect moves rapidly over 12 vibrating silicone legs, in random directions.
It’s fun to do a maze of blocks to see if you can find the way out.
It is also durable.

A more moderate side of order maintenance is promoted in China
As an urban instructor sergeant, Tang Shenbin marked the passage in a city square, severely inspecting the nervous people in his charge, issuing orders in a low voice with military authority.
He wanted the female members of Chengguan, the pompous policemen of China’s urban order, feared and despised for their capricious energetic measures and their penchant for violence, to convey a certain impression to a handful of spectators.
"Firms!"
"Attention!"
Show them, he whispered, "how pretty the girls are!"
Four girls who barely spent their teenage years wearing identical white gloves and olive green jackets and tight pants to attract attention.
Four pairs of perfectly aligned black shoes.
Four elegant hats perfectly placed above the hair tied with blue and white stripes.
“Personally, I think they look normal,” Mr. Tang said, scornfully.
“The models are beautiful.”
More than one government has tried to clean up the image of China’s urban inspectors.
One city ordered all new recruits to have a degree.
Guangdong Province changed the grayish green color of the uniforms to a supposedly more attractive blue.
Wuhan, in central China, replaced the use of force with intimidating gazes: in 2009, according to a report, 50 officers surrounded a dishonoured snack cart, and watched it with their eyebrows constantly frowning for half an hour, until the traveling salesman picked up his stuff and left.
Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants in Chengdu, has chosen a radical change of image.
Since 2003, the district has added to its urban police 13 women, expressly chosen for their appearance, proportion and youth.
The idea is to give the rough cop a softer, feminine side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson would have to fight to increase China’s little respect for these city squads.
And for good reason, critics would argue.
Unlike the police, these officers are only allowed to enforce city ordinances, imposing fines and other administrative penalties.
But the Chinese news media routinely portrays a different reality.
In January 2008, inspectors from Hubei Province beat a passerby to death after they used their cell phone to film them while dissolving a protest against a waste dump.
Last year, a training manual for Beijing inspectors was stolen and published online, describing how to effectively beat criminals without causing them to bleed.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon street vendor suffered brain damage after a row with five officers.
A violent video game, available for download online, features Chinese-trained inspectors attacking street vendors.
“Chengguan has left a scar on the government,” lamented China Daily, a national publication, last year after another controversy over tactics.
The newspaper demanded "a really meticulous cleaning".
Skeptics say the current approach is far from that.
After the district requested through a notice eight new female recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News wondered whether women had real duties or were simply a stage distraction.
The answer seems to be a bit of both.
The district notice asked for female candidates aged 18 to 22, with a good figure “and the five harmonious facial features.”
They should have a height above average, greater than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches.
Withdrawal at the age of 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the work was physically too hard for women over the age of 25.
“His image is the important thing,” an anonymous district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-government website.
"First, the external qualities of the candidates will determine whether they meet the requirements, such as height, weight, facial features, etc."
Then comes the temperament "and the inner qualities."
The female chengguans are like florists, he said, adding, “besides being florists, they will have other responsibilities.”
Zheng Lihua, deputy director of the district city administration office, is not eager to back that description.
But he noted that height requirements were standard in many Chinese job ads for both sexes.
Then comes the requirement for harmonious facial features.
If this means bet, it is a matter of debate among the Chinese.
Surely, the disabled or disfigured should not be presented.
“We can’t allow a picky person or a humpback to come to work here,” Mr. Zheng said.
"His image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22 years old, with colorful cheeks and a subtly curved mouth.
She doesn’t think the accent on her look is sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with a sardonic look.
His co-worker with dimples, 21-year-old Xu Yang, said “Our work should present the image of the city.”
They also don’t object to their fixed-time work, they said, because they harbor greater career ambitions than simply driving salespeople off the streets where they’re supposed to circumscribe their business.
Each morning, the squadron faces a dozen or so street vendors who throw themselves on foot or by bike, trying to sell as many buns or tofu bowls as possible before they are thrown out.
"Mr. Wang, you have to leave."
"We've told you many times!" said Miss Xu as a salesman ran away on foot, temporarily abandoning his bicycle-drawn cart with noodle garnishes.
Officers describe their duties as more monotonous than exhausting.
“This is pretty much the same thing every day,” said 20-year-old Huang Jing, who studies marketing in his spare hours.
"Muy rutinario".
One reason is that female officers lack the power of their male counterparts to confiscate sellers’ merchandise.
They can only threaten to report the offenders to their male supervisors.
This tends to protect them from the sudden public displays of animosity against the bureaucracy, which are common throughout China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the provincial capital of Yunnan, rioted after rumors spread that Chengguan officers had killed a salesman.
More than a dozen police or chengguan officers were injured in the night episode; 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire.
For the time being, Xindu has avoided such violence.
But calm is hardly guaranteed.
Just two blocks from the peaceful Baoguang Square, where female officers patrolled that morning, more than 50 people gathered in a corner.
Officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk rather than in a workshop, as required by regulation.
The owner of the bike was screaming.
The situation stalled for 15 minutes before the officers, with a bad face, opened way to the elbows to their vehicles and quickly left with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator assigned to the male squad, remained behind, with his white badge turned to hide his name.
Like female officers, coordinators, men aged 40 and over, play a purely supportive role.
Unlike them, they are not taught to maintain an elegant image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
“Sometimes we fight physically,” Mr. Li said with total naturalness.
“Most of the time it’s the audience that starts the fight.”
Prosecutors will not press charges against Senator Ensign
The senator’s lawyers announced Wednesday that Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges that arose from his affair with a former campaign assistant and his efforts to secure lobbying work for the woman’s husband.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat facing Ensign, the Republican from Nevada who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate for 2012, until the scandal over his affair had national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign’s office said it was “certainly happy” with the decision, which came after a year-long investigation.
The senator could still face a disciplinary measure from the Senate ethics committee.
Ensign’s lawyers said the Justice Department had “informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of his investigation and that he has no plans to bring charges against him on this issue.”
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there appeared to be significant evidence to indicate that Ensign may have conspired to violate a federal criminal lobbying ban.
The interviews, email and other documents first released in October 2009 in the New York Times indicated that Ensign had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, gain lucrative lobbying work to achieve the silence of Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, over the senator’s affair with her.
Mrs. Hampton once worked as a treasurer for an Ensign campaign.
Ensign contacted several political sponsors to find work for Mr. Hampton and advocated on their behalf after they had hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to documents and interviews.
As Hampton had recently been an assistant to Ensign, he was barred under the law from lobbying for his former employer or the Senate for a year.
Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Ensign and Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared to be at odds with the so-called “revolving door lobbying ban,” which seeks to restrict former state employees from using their connections to do personal business.
From the evidence that has been made public, “it appeared to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to substantially violate the revolving door statute,” said Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials refused to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared wary of accepting political prosecutions after several major setbacks for its public integrity section, including last year’s decision to drop the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens, a prosecutor who is currently on trial.
Federal prosecutors “are clearly cowards,” said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a defense group that brought several complaints against Ensign in the case.
“This basically means that high-ranking government officials can now assume that the laws don’t apply to them,” he added.
Paul Coggins, Ensign’s lead attorney, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and another call more the next day, telling him the department didn’t want to press charges against his client.
Ensign’s defense team had been cooperating with prosecutors in an attempt to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, “acted in accordance with the law.”
Coggins refused to explain in detail the legal arguments he gave to prosecutors.
“I don’t feel comfortable getting into details about my discussions with the Department of Justice, I can only say that we think they made the right decision,” he said.
Last month, the Federal Election Commission decided to change an investigation into a separate complaint by the ethics group, which alleges that a $96,000 payment from Ensign’s parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it did not have enough evidence to prove that the money was nothing more than a gift.
NV Energy is a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator, who got a job through lobbying thanks to the help Ensign gave Hampton.
An email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company accepted Hampton as a lobbyist, Ensign’s chief of staff, John Lopez, contacted Hampton and told him that he was “killing” the Home Office over a disputed issue.
Ensign also attended a luncheon with Hampton and another Nevada customer, Allegiant Air, and called the transport secretary to set up a meeting on behalf of the airline after he had hired Hampton to lobby.
When news of the affair first surfaced last year, Ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping a low profile for many months, two weeks ago Ensign told reporters he planned to run for a third term in the Senate.
When Ensign’s spokesman, Jennifer Cooper, announced that Ensign was no longer the subject of a criminal investigation, he said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the Justice Department’s lead and conclude its investigation.
“Senator Ensign has a desire to continue his difficult work on behalf of the people of Nevada,” he said.
Cheshire's appeal will target Twitter
There were half a dozen of them "chatting" in the rows of the courtroom.
Minute by minute, they sent reports of the horrific testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the process that addressed the rape and the children tied to their beds in a house that was set on fire.
On Thursday, the widely followed trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of a family in Cheshire, Connecticut, is set to reach an official end, with the death penalty judge’s imposition voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes’ lawyers have filed court papers outlining the arguments of the appeals that will likely occupy the courts for years to come.
One of the most provocative claims that the intense reports about the process, including the widespread use of Twitter by mass media journalists, created “a circus atmosphere,” and such widespread and immediate saturation with exhilarating details caused public passions to exert an inappropriate influence on the jury.
The complaint could force appellate judges to deal with the question of whether the new technology requires new rules in the courtroom.
“Based on what I experienced during this process, I think there is a real danger that the inclusion of the new technology in the courtroom is affecting the individual’s rights to have a fair trial,” said Thomas J. Ullmann, senior defense attorney for Mr. Hayes.
First-instance judge Jon C. Blue of the State Superior Court laconically rejected the lawsuits in a ruling last week, saying the news media was "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury had been taken by passion.
But it probably won’t be the last word on the subject.
For decades, appellate courts have recognized that coverage of celebrated cases can raise questions about the impartiality of a trial.
In a landmark 1966 ruling, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, saying in his decision, in the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case, that there was "a carnival atmosphere in the process" due to the media.
The crime is believed to have been inspired by the TV show and the film "The Fugitive".
Some lawyers said the appellate courts that examined Hayes’ conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules might be needed to control how he communicates from courtrooms, something unimaginable at the time of Dr. Sheppard’s case.
"There is a general concern about the impact of new media" on high-profile processes, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at Stanford Law School, who studied Connecticut's death penalty and wrote a report in which it was said it was imposed arbitrarily.
Professor Donohue said some appellate judges might be intrigued by the idea that limiting immediate communication from courtrooms could make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many issues outlined by Hayes’ lawyers, which will likely be discussed for years, delaying an execution.
Defense lawyers also claim, for example, that Hayes could have been harmed when Judge Blue refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors, showing them gruesome photographs of the crime scene during jury selection.
Some jurors have said they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17 and Michaela, 11.
Defense lawyers say they will also question the constitutionality of the death penalty and argue that the judge incorrectly removed a jury that had criticized prosecutors, and that he had incorrectly pressed for a verdict for his strange decision to order the jury to deliberate for a weekend.
The jurors were not kidnapped.
But his arguments about the effect of intense process coverage can attract most interest.
They noted in a rejection of the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the U.S. Senate.
They argued that the media continually threw firewood into the excitement over the case.
“The daily crowding of media tweets, cameras and reporters out of court,” the attorneys wrote, “was something never seen here in New Haven and perhaps throughout the state.”
His attention to Tweeter coverage is controversial.
In some interviews, some journalists said that the complaint about the fact that the immediate news was more important than the reports delivered more slowly, was a ludicrous vision that would make the court’s policy on controlling coverage weak in future lawsuits.
But some lawyers said the appellate courts often felt drawn to arguments about the adaptation that was required in the courts due to social and technological changes.
Hayes' lawyers are pushing for that claim.
In their letter, they referred to the 1966 Supreme Court decision, which overturns Dr. Sheppard’s conviction for covering the trial, and made it clear that they would demand that the new media require new rules.
"This case," they wrote, "represents the Sheppard vs. Maxwell case of the 21st century."
Can civility build a bridge to unite the divisions?
After a remarkable campaign for invective and negativity, this week has triggered a bit of civility in Washington.
Is it a omen of genuine bipartisan cooperation in the future or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and Congressional leaders produced no progress on the major issues to be addressed during the outgoing session.
But as everyone says, it was at least a polite discussion about the differences between the two parties, as well as a recognition of their shared responsibilities to govern, rather than being another empty episode to gain partisan points.
Wednesday’s public meeting of the president’s deficit commission was equally civilised, despite the political differences that remain between members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months generated mutual respect that transcends the ideological gap that still separates members.
That is hardly enough to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived.
Now both sides are in a testing period, probing each other to identify signs of co-operativeism and commitment, as they try to assess the limits of public opinion and voters’ patience for a renewed partisan war.
This is the reason why the Tuesday meeting and subsequent evaluations of the same by the participants were made with a minimum of demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too great and are very deeply rooted to suggest any rapid climate change that has existed over the past two years.
Whether it’s taxes, expenses, health care or social assistance, the two sides are at opposite poles.
Anyway, the November election has softened the mood in Washington, at least in the short term.
“There’s no doubt that things have changed with regard to the way things are said,” said Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now at the Center for Ethics and Public Policy.
“They are inevitable after the election.
The elections arouse partisan passions, which then go extinct.
That's good."
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda of the outgoing session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
Bush’s tax cuts are due at the end of the year, and no one is in favor of this.
Both parties want to find a way to preserve some or all of the reductions, either permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, there is likely to be a commitment to expand unemployment benefits, probably because Republicans can’t make you believe they’re in favor of tax cuts for the rich, denying the unemployment benefit for the unemployed workers.
After Tuesday’s meeting at the White House, there is increased optimism about a possible deal on these issues during the outgoing session, along with the ratification of the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) nuclear disarmament pact.
But William Galston of the Brookings Institution warns that successful cooperation on pressing issues of the outgoing session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress meets in January.
He said, on the contrary, that it is very likely and even inevitable that a period of disagreement will begin.
“After the things that need to be done are carried out, in the short term psychology will turn the situation into a confrontational one,” he said.
Wehner also expressed skepticism (which is widely shared) about the fact that civility can lead to true cooperation.
“I see most of what will happen between now and 2012 as an essay for the 2012 main event,” he said.
The reasons have a lot to do with the constitution of the new Republican majority in the House and the Tea Party voters, who contributed decisively to its creation.
As much as Republican leaders are aware of the dangers of exaggerating their position, they know they must try to live up to their promises to cut state spending and overturn the new health law.
Those lines of support are already clearly seen in the initial reactions to the deficit commission’s recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and increasing some taxes and retirement age, and cutting spending.
Co-chairs Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken care of one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and, in their own assessment, have forcibly introduced the issue of the deficit on the public agenda in a way that cannot be ignored.
But they need 14 votes in the 18-member committee to publish their plan as an official recommendation, and have been struggling to get close to that figure.
The greatest resistance is among the elected officials on the panel, suggesting that in tax matters there is, at least currently, little basis or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the battles between the Republicans in the White House and those in Congress.
The first will happen next year in the form of partisan clashes, when Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and medical care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the change?
Public opinion.
There is considerable evidence that, despite the partisanship of the recent election, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties working together.
If the confrontation leads to a dead end, as happened in 1995, then both parties will watch closely the reaction of the people.
Anyone who thinks they’re losing is likely to change course and seek engagement.
However, this can be an optimistic view.
The partisanship and polarization are currently greater than they were in the mid-1990s, and there seems to be a larger ideological gap between Obama and Republicans in Congress than there was between President Bill Clinton and Republicans at the time.
At the same time, activists from both parties see 2010 as the mere prelude to a more momentous election in 2012.
Given this reality, the civilization shown this week can be welcomed by many Americans.
But this will require much more effort on the part of both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
A leaked U.S. document portrays Moscow as the paradise of corruption
Control of the city is in the hands of a “cleptocracy,” and it leaves a portion of the bribes and protection money it collects directly to the Kremlin, the U.S. Embassy in Russia reported in February.
It was reported that both the police and the Federal Security Service run huge blackmail systems, which helps explain the high cost of living in Moscow.
They raise money not only from legitimate businesses, but also from organized criminal groups.
Each stratum of bureaucracy, what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called “vertical authority,” takes its share as money climbs the scale.
The note, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by WikiLeaks on its website on Wednesday.
The note is based on sources whose names have been censored.
It was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow, and he blames it for much of the corruption.
President Dmitry Medvedev fired him in October, but there has been little evidence of a cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a major construction company, have consistently denied corruption allegations over the years, and he has won several libel lawsuits over such allegations.
In September, when asked on a Russian television channel about a documentary that suggested it was corrupt, he stated: “It’s crazy, it’s crazy, it’s annoying.”
According to polls, Russians overwhelmingly believe their society is corrupt.
But it is unusual to find the details explained in detail, as they were in the embassy report, and it is unheard of for diplomats from a foreign country to do so.
"The direct links of the Moscow city government to crime have led some to call it 'disfunctional', and to claim that the government functions more as a kleptocracy than as a government," it said.
“Criminal elements enjoy a ‘krysha’ (a term of the criminal and mafia world that literally means ‘roof’ or protection) that bypasses the police, the Federal Security Service (SFS), the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor’s office, as well as all sectors of the Moscow city government’s bureaucracy.
"Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
"The SFS, the MVD and the militia are on the second level."
“Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.”
“This is an ineffective system in which criminal groups fill a void in some areas because the city does not provide some services.”
The report states that the SFS collects money from larger companies, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, the report said, “explained that Moscow’s commercial owners understand that it is best to get protection from MVD and SFS (rather than organized crime groups) as they not only have more weapons, resources and power than criminal groups, but are also protected by law.”
“For this reason, protection against criminal gangs is no longer a priority.”
The note notes that while the collection of money is complete, protection may be irregular; even those who pay are subject to arrest.
Those who don’t pay quickly find their businesses closed under one pretext or another.
Medvedev has spoken several times about the fight against corruption, but he has confessed that he has made little progress.
The embassy note reports about men taking suitcases, probably full of cash, inside the Kremlin itself.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to trust the bureaucrats," Georgy Satarov, director of the Indem expert group in Moscow, said in a recent interview.
"But he's a part of this bureaucracy."
"He does not belong to a political class, because there is no longer a political class in Russia."
Without politics, without an opposition, without a separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable.
At the national level, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia more than $300 billion a year.
In a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption conducted by the non-governmental organization Transparency International, the country was ranked 154th (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The revelation of the U.S. Embassy note, which did not happen until late at night Moscow time, will surely cause disgust within the Russian government, and even though Luzhkov may be blamed for Moscow’s weaknesses, it could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Interviewed for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that the WikiLeaks documents could be lies and reacted furiously to a revelation that U.S. diplomats called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
“The truth of the matter is that this is related to our interaction, which is an important factor of domestic policies in this country,” he said.
“But to be honest with you, we don’t suspect that this would have been done with such arrogance, with such pressure, and, you know, that it would have been done in such an immoral way.”
Veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to face the past
In a dimly lit concrete classroom, with stained and peeled walls, the headmaster of Anlong Veng High School reminded the man who had built it, the last leader of the Ta Mok Red Khmers.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
“He was a good leader and cared about his people,” said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
Known as "The Butcher" for his brutality during the Khmer Rouge government, the commander remains popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure, and where thousands of the organization's former soldiers still live.
But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the government, long-held loyalty is finally being challenged at Anlong Veng.
In April, a local forum for truth and reconciliation allowed victims to publicly confront those who had participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed here a high school textbook that for the first time teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of their former soldiers.
And in July, a United Nations-Cambodia joint court issued the first conviction of a former member of the Khmer Rouge, sentencing former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each of these events, anxiety has grown among Anlong Veng’s Red Khmer veterans, complicating efforts for reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into Cambodian society.
“There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge, but they can’t do anything,” said Chhang Youk, director of the Cambodian Documentation Center, an independent organization investigating the regime.
For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.
“This is creating divisions within families.”
During Cambodia’s Khmer Rouge government, between 1975 and 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of hunger, disease or overwork.
When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the Pol Pot-led government in 1979, the remnants of the regime and its military fled to the Cambodian-Thai border.
There they launched an insurrection that lasted until the last movement that surrendered in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrilla war from their bases in the mountains and jungles of western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated followers in Anlong Veng.
But in the mid-1990s, after a UN-sponsored peace deal led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Red Khmer fighters began defecting to the government, culminating in the surrenders of Ieng Sary in 1996, and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had resisted, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
He died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while awaiting trial.
Without the support of their benefactors, the oldest fighters of the Khmer Rouge fell into the absolute misery that is common in rural Cambodia, and many feel nostalgia for the movement.
Although a few elite Red Khmer officials retained their local administrative posts in exchange for laying down their weapons, the plainclothes soldiers remain poor and unskilled farmers.
“These people have obtained few benefits after surrender,” said Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which offers public forums across Cambodia, including at Anlong Veng.
“They have incorporated the regime’s utopian agrarian ideology.”
“They were raised without any concept of doing business.”
Sister Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle near Anlong Veng before dedicating himself to life as a poor rice farmer in 1998.
“Life with the Khmer Rouge was fine,” he said.
"Ta Mok gave it to everyone to eat."
“But now life is hard because we have to self-sufficient.”
The current Khmer Rouge court has also caused concerns here.
Earlier next year, the court is expected to start prosecuting Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former minister of the Khmer Rouge.
The court’s mandate is to prosecute the top leaders and those most responsible for the crimes, but it has not said whether it will pursue cases beyond those four.
This did not serve much to calm the fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province during the Red Khmer government in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers at the Cambodian Documentation Centre that she had overseen the construction of the Trapeang Thma Dam, a project that is thought to have killed thousands of forced laborers.
During a recent gloomy afternoon, Im Chaem returned from working in the fields to his home on wooden piles on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun cast long shadows over the dry grass, Im Chaem refused to talk about his past in the Red Khmers.
She said that if the court summoned her, she would not appear.
"Cambodia is at peace and stable," he said.
“If there are more prosecutions, there will be war.”
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that there will be instability if the court pursues more suspects, although experts and historians question it.
“Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past,” he said.
But facing the past is exactly what Cambodia needs to do to move forward, said Chhang Youk, of the documentation center.
"Reconciliation, according to Khmer, is to reunite the broken pieces," he said.
“It is our obligation to assemble these broken pieces so that we can understand.”
The center produced the first government-approved 75-page textbook on the Khmer Rouge, called A History of Democratic Kampuchea.
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Ministry of Education’s high school history textbook, which contains less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
As in most of Cambodia, the young people of Anlong Veng know little about the Khmer Rouge, despite the city’s link to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook helped students understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
“My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the court,” he said.
“They have suspicions because they’re not sure how many people the court will prosecute.”
Such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
But public forums, the textbook, and the courtroom are starting to make an impact, he said.
Anyway, here the Red Khmers retain a powerful charm.
In the Dangrek Mountains, a road with too many weeds and covered with discarded plastic bags leads to a black soot rectangle covered by a rusty tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a cellphone salesman on the edge of the road, said he didn’t know much about the man who was cremated there.
"But he has a strong spirit and many locals go there to pray to him," he said.
It was Nuom Sothea’s birthday, and later that day he decided to walk to the place of Pol Pot’s last rest, where he would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in the hope of good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stockpile of weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama’s campaign to protect nuclear material around the world, the Belarusian government announced Wednesday that it will give up its highly enriched uranium stockpile, a critical component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was revealed in a joint statement released after Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusian Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a security summit.
For years, the U.S. government had been trying to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium and it seemed that they had reached a point of no return last spring.
But U.S. officials told the Washington Post that a couple of classified operations with Belarus over the past two months were carried out to remove 84.82 kg of weapon-grade uranium from a Belarusian research facility.
This set the stage for Wednesday’s agreement to remove the rest of the material, about 227 kg, according to one official, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the confidentiality of the matter.
The deal appeared to be one of the most important outcomes of the 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit chaired by Obama in April, which excluded Belarus.
And apparently it was a good achievement to secure the invitation of the former Soviet republic to the next summit in 2012.
“I was really fascinated by the fact that they wanted a place at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit.”
“This shows that this process is working,” said Ken Luongo, president of the Society for Global Security, a group that promotes nuclear safety.
Clinton said the deal was "a very significant and important step" taken by Belarus.
In April 2009, Obama promised in Prague to protect all vulnerable nuclear material worldwide over the next four years.
Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the time of the Obama Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the nation would never give up its uranium.
“We have conserved highly enriched uranium (hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapon-grade uranium) and low-enrichment uranium,” Lukashenko said at the time.
“This is our raw material... we’re not going to make dirty bombs, and we’re not going to sell them to anyone.”
“We use it for research purposes, that’s all.”
However, Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, indicating interest in reaching an agreement.
Officials said the first task of removing uranium from Belarus in October was particularly complicated, as the material had been slightly irradiated.
Officials said it was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 2,000 km to a Russian facility for storage and disposal.
According to officials, the second operation ended on Monday and was made by plane.
The U.S. government spent $13 million on the tasks, and most of the money was used to supply Belarus with the facility of research with low-enrichment uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
Andrew Bieniawski, an Energy Department official working on Global Threat Reduction, said "this was coordinated and orchestrated very carefully to strengthen confidence" that led to the deal signed by Clinton.
The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimated this year that Belarus possessed at least 40 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will try to remove its reservation by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Relations between Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly due to Lukashenko’s harsh crackdown on human rights.
But Wednesday’s statement suggested a potential relaxation.
It stated that “while progress on these global security issues is welcomed, the United States and Belarus recognized that greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remains a central issue for improving bilateral relations, and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens.”
The Spanish government did not regret the CIA flights
The Spanish government did not regret the CIA flights with Taliban and Al Qaeda prisoners headed to Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo by Spanish territory, the U.S. ambassador to Madrid said in a telegram.
This is reflected in the leaked documents (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El Pa<0xC3><0xAD>s, where it is added that the then First Vice President of the Government, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Teresa Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive be informed to "be able to demonstrate that they exercised appropriate surveillance on foreign aircraft passing through Spain".
In June 2006, following a Council of Europe report accusing a dozen countries, including Spain, of complicity in human rights practices, there was a meeting between former US ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez de la Vega.
The vice-president acknowledged that the Council report "had taken the Zapatero government out of the game" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide in this matter.
"De la Vega stressed that Spain has no regrets about intelligence flights through Spanish territory."
“They just want to be informed” to avoid being “unsuspectedly caught,” Aguirre recounts on a cable.
The then Foreign Secretary, Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel Moratinos, also pointed out to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible profile, although, being in the hands of the judges, the Government had a limited capacity for influence."
For his part, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez transmitted to the Embassy that he would not try to block the judge’s initiative to ask for the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Center (CNI) and the Ministry of Defense on the flights of the CIA.
“These reports do not contain any incriminating elements or any sensitive information,” the embassy said after speaking to the prosecutor.
However, the US reflected its concern about the "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German prosecutors", rather than the declassified information from the CNI or the Ministry of Defense.
“This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case discreetly between governments,” Aguirre laments.
In March 2007, at a luncheon between the U.S. ambassador and Interior Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, Rubalcaba told him that "although the Spanish judges are furiously jealous of their independence and will do what they deem appropriate", he had instructed his collaborators "to avoid comments of inflammatory rhetoric, in a tempera
The Ambassador also expresses his concern about the PP's action in this matter.
“Despite its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not hesitate to capitalize on any indication that the Zapatero government tolerated or deliberately ignored U.S. actions that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if these revelations have negative consequences for the U.S. government,” he said.
The Parricide Confession Complained in the Network of the “Agobius” of Being a Mother
The girl was talking about the boy when he was already dead and had a blog: "Terror to the Galician"
M<0xC3><0xB3>nica Juanatey Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez is "Muki" on the net.
With this nickname, which she used from a young age, she communicated with a cousin and, at least, a friend; the two natives of Noia, the Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a people from which she is from.
The messages belong to 2008.
To understand them, it is necessary to know their sentimental life, which ABC reconstructs through testimonies of their relatives.
The young Galician, 30, began a relationship in 1998 with Iv<0xC3><0xA1>n T<0xC3><0xBA><0xC3><0xB1>ez, an industrialist.
They lasted a year.
When they left him, it soon became known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know if the baby was his, but his ex never let him get his DNA tested.
It was not long before he met another man.
The chosen one was Alberto, a boy from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
He lived with him for a long time.
Caesar lived with them.
When the girl went to the Balearic Islands to survey the labor market, the little one stayed with her partner, who even came to accompany her for a week to Palma.
But from the content of the communications, it is seen that their romance fractured, they broke.
In March 2008 he is in Menorca, alone, and writes: "Alberto is very rare and masked, because I have come to work."
“When I told him it felt good, but of course, he now realizes what it’s like to be with the child all day and not have the freedom to do what he wants.”
Then he talks about a message to the cell phone he just received: “I want you to come back this month or give me an address to send to the child.”
She complains, "If you don't like me leaving the cub with my mother, I'll pick it up when I get back," she claims.
In May, he talks about his return to his village: “This week I’m going there, but I’ll only be there until the 19th, because on the 20th I have to present myself to a job in order not to lose it.”
He makes it clear that if all goes well, he takes his firstborn.
“He’s going to be with whoever he owes, i.e., with me, and never in my life will I ever think of leaving him again with anyone but my mother,” doubtful intention given his bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When you type it, it is assumed that the child, who arrived on the island on the 1st of that month, and was supposedly killed on the 10th, is dead.
"Caesar is happy on the one hand, but not on the other."
“On the one hand he’s with me and he likes the place a bit, but on the other he’s going to class almost every day.”
Talk about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He'll go there (the kid) to some summer classes, and so I'll save myself some kangaroo pasta."
On the 17th, memories and complaints.
"A very big kiss from Caesar, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent you I don't know what videos to email, look how when he wants to find me, you have to fuck."
On the 30th, another: "The child is fine, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan."
From Victor, his current partner, there is one: "He advances me money."
On the Internet there are messages of his in blogs dedicated to anime and manga.
He even had his own in the now-intervened MySpace universe, where he was called "Muki the Ex-Prisoner."
"Terror a la gallega (ep<0xC3><0xAD>graphe)".
The last man to live with her, the jury, declares his regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn’t want to believe that it all happened because he didn’t tell him he was a single mother.
Monica entered yesterday in the provincial penitentiary of Palma, coming from the center of judicial detainees in Menorca.
The lawyer, Carlos Maceda, explained that he does not remember how the events happened, "nor had any intention of causing any harm to the minor."
Before, he did confess that he had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his corpse in a suitcase.
The defense and the prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
The popular would win 4 seats in Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lleida, Tarragona and Barcelona
After the significant increase in votes and experienced deputies in the recent regional elections, the Catalan PP already has the view in the general elections because, be it forward or not, the prospects are more than positive, since the number of votes this formation gets in those elections usually doubles the one it receives in the Catalan ones.
Thus, the popular Catalans obtained 610,473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the regional elections of 2006, the figure amounted to 316,222.
Last Sunday, the PPC won 384,091 votes.
If this upward trend, which has been nourished by a transfer of votes from the PSC and the loyalty of the PP electorate, is maintained, analysts of this formation have calculated that, if general elections were held, the PPC could go from 8 to 12 deputies in Congress, while the CiU would also win four (now has 10) and the PSC would lose nothing.
These calculations would confirm that the Catalan square is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to popular analysis, ERC would lose one MP - now it has three - while ICV would stay with one MP or win one.
But, if the electoral calendar is maintained, the most immediate appointment will take place in May 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular can also be decisive in the end of socialist hegemony in the four provincial capitals and in their relief at the head of the Diputaci<0xC3><0xB3>n de Barcelona, one of the administrations that manages the most budget - 661 million euros for 2011 - .
Both nationalists and popular agree on the possibility that the PSC will lose the municipalities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Girona, where the socialists would not get a majority nor the possibility of resorting to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the Republican debacle, it would not be foolish for this formation to lose its representation in the Barcelona Consistory - 5% of the votes need to be obtained - .
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decisive force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The nationalists are convinced that they can play the role of the overthrow in the Tarraconese capital, where they ruled with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Félix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been located only 500 votes from the PSC, whose mayor, Angel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy - during this last campaign, they met on several occasions.
The popular have also grown in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Currently, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan cell provided thousands of passports to Al Qaeda
In addition to the seven detainees in Barcelona, there were three in Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and the Nigerian arrested by agents of the General Police Information Commission in Barcelona in 2008 formed a jihadist cell that, led from Thailand, provided passports to different groups of Al Qaeda, including "The Tigers for the Liberation of the Tamil Land" (LTTE) and "Laskar and Taiba" (Lett), the latter's author of Death.
The Ministry of the Interior has given great importance to these investigations, to the point of ensuring that with "Operation Kampai" has been "weakened" the apparatus of falsification of Al Qaeda at the international level and, "therefore, its operational capacity".
The researchers calculate that the cell, in the two years it has been active in Catalonia, has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were forged and then distributed to the groups that make up the criminal Al Qaeda galaxy so that their “combatants” can cross the borders of Europe and other Western countries with total impunity.
The decommissioned cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had operational in Europe, so the investigations have involved, in addition to Thai services, other European police units, so it is not ruled out that in the territory of the EU in the coming days strikes similar to the one developed last Tuesday night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanis Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were arrested), in Thailand another was developed with the capture of the Pakistanis Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Mohammad Sadique Khan Begum, Tan, Tanveer Arshad Arshad and the Nigerian Babad, Babad and Babad and Babad.
These were the ones who led from Bangkok the cell settled in Spain and in other European countries.
The Catalan network - part of it was hit in 2009 - mainly stole passports from tourists that met the requirements marked by the so-called "World Islamic Front".
That is, the documents should be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years old, with a validity of several years and without a stamped visa.
In the media of the investigation it is emphasized that, at the moment, no data has been found that links the arrested in Catalonia with the Bombay attack, despite the fact that the author of this attack, "Laskar and Taiba", was one of the groups receiving the stolen passports in Spain and then falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be remembered that days before this attack was committed, from Catalonia were sent through a transfer agency about a thousand dollars that were "invested" in the purchase of mobile cards that were then used by the members of the "command" that killed 106 people.
The police have been seized of abundant documentation.
The PP requires Mas to park the fiscal concert
The leader of the PPC, Alicia S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez-Camacho, had the opportunity yesterday to personally expose to Artur Mas his conditions to support his investiture as president of the Generalitat, identical to those already raised during the campaign and that are summed up in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and to dispense with philo-sovereignist adventures, as is the national leader.
The president of the popular Catalans attended the meeting of Artur Mas with the certainty that he has obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, figure more than enough to make himself wanted, because the candidate of CiU needs that at least one of the formations that will exercise the opposition abstain in the investiture vote.
A possible deal with the PP depends on the future alliances that nationalists want to keep in Congress when general elections are held, but, for the moment, the talks that Mas holds these days with the rest of the political leaders are done in Catalan key.
And as for the PP president, to support an investiture "all the sovereignist and independentist speeches will have to be parked", as well as the economic concert - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the convergent leader intends to even submit to a referendum.
Both leaders do have in common their commitment to slimming down the political apparatus of a highly inflated autonomic administration and eliminating the inheritance and donation tax.
The details of the negotiations on Mas’ investiture will be dealt with by the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
But he has already met with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will do so with Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laporta (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geriatrician says the deaths were not due to "lack of measures"
The owners of the center of Olot do not rule out that their caretaker killed more than 11 elderly
The heads of the geriatric La Caritat de Olot (Gerona) yesterday offered a press conference to highlight the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while there employed killed at least eleven elderly people who were in charge.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the lawyer of the center, Joan Ca<0xC3><0xB1>ada, and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be to be able to exercise the charge against the person responsible" for the deaths but "the legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the procedural situation of civil officials".
And it is that in addition to the social contempt that the entity may suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the jailer, the great threat to La Caritat now takes the form of substantial compensation that are already being calculated by the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime dates back to August 2009 and that since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already pointed out in the car that ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - former patients of the geriatrician - that he suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the deceased but, taking into account the age and pathologies of the patients, the procedure was sent by phone.
The charity, through its director, strongly denied this extreme yesterday and pointed out that "the lack of measures can never have been the cause of what has happened."
La Caritat’s lawyer added that “in the case there is not a single indication that there has been reckless action by anyone other than the defendant himself.”
The former "Angel of Death" confessed to 11 murders yesterday and detailed that the first crime was committed on August 29, 2009 to, a month and a half later, kill a second grandmother.
In this case, he caused his death by injecting him with an overdose of insulin, unlike the first crime he committed using a mixture of sedative pills.
The director of La Caritat points out that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center have access to medicines.
Insulin stabbings and a cocktail of sedatives would have been the mechanism employed in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his quest to alleviate the suffering of the inmates, used to kill them.
But it will be the analyses that are being done in the laboratory that will have to clarify if Vila does not lie and sought for his first victims a less cruel death or if, on the contrary, he burned them inside giving them bleach as he has already confessed that he did with the three women he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat they do not give credibility to the manifestations of the jailer, not even to the number of murders confessed, which do not rule out that he is superior, and justify his attitude in the different versions that Vila has given in his visits to the court and in the sense that he has to change his way of proceeding after having successfully committed eight murders.
That is why they say they are making themselves available to justice to clarify the scope of this event.
The ECB is threatening
Investors reacted sharply yesterday to Trichet’s threat yesterday warning that “the markets should not underestimate our ability to react.”
Peripheral spreads have closed strongly and European banks’ shares have risen by more than 5%.
However, we should also not underestimate the ECB's ability to make mistakes and the euro has barely rebounded, which is a worrying sign.
What happened yesterday is typical of an illiquid market that, just as it is collapsing, is recovering but motivated by the closure of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investor will take a long time to lose the fear.
A month ago the ECB quoted us today to withdraw liquidity measures and will have to retract tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those that remain.
The Bundesbank demanded the end of the public debt purchase plan for ineffectiveness and eliminating all extraordinary liquidity measures over time and leaving only unlimited access per week.
Following the Irish crisis, we expect them to extend the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and keep the quarterly auction with unlimited access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We also expect them to continue with their bond purchase program and even give the signal to step it up.
If they do not meet the expectations generated they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they are still obsessed with withdrawing liquidity measures, God help us!
As at their May meeting where they claimed they hadn’t even contemplated buying bonds and the markets collapsed, tomorrow the story could be repeated.
The ECB must be credible and persistent.
In May he announced the bazooka on Monday and on Wednesday said he had already bought a lot, causing a new market crash.
Yesterday the auction of letters to a year in Portugal has been very poor.
The Treasury only issued 500 million at 5.28%, versus 750 million at 4.81% of the previous auction.
Still, rates in Portugal fell 30 basis points across the curve, clearly reflecting a shift in market sentiment behind Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the Allied and Bank of Ireland hole figures have been made public.
The estimated figures are about 10 billion in the short term and another 15,000 potential and have until February to get private capital or will be nationalized.
Although Ireland has no credibility after failing to spot the problem in July with the stress tests, the figures are amenable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, next Tuesday, the Government will have to get parliamentary approval of its new budget and it still does not have enough support, so Ireland remains a focus of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of her speech to ease the tension ahead of the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government on 14 December in which a political commitment is needed to show that we are a union and that we all play the same score.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest of Beethoven’s anthem of joy.
In Spain, the president had the gift of opportunity when he presented yesterday the plan of measures that will be approved on Friday by the Council of Ministers.
Pension reform, transparency in autonomous communities and financial institutions, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment sound in the ears of investors like the four Vivaldi stations.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish Stock Exchange has risen 4.5%, twice as much as the rest of European Stock Exchanges.
Unlike February, the reaction of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been swift and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three-year bond that will benefit from the Trichet effect so we expect it to be resolved with strong demand and help dispel doubts about our refinancing capacity.
For Spain, asking for a Help Plan would be a self-immolation.
They would give us a line of liquidity that we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40 billion in liquidity available triple that in March, at very expensive rates and closes you access to the markets sine d<0xC3><0xAD>e.
However, the strategy must remain that of Caesar’s wife, “besides being, it seems.”
Come on, we can.
President of Eulen will challenge the Vega Sicilia board asked by his children
The storm does not linger in the open conflict in the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, founder of the group, will challenge, considering it "null of full right", the judicial board of El Enebro on the next day 16, requested by five of his seven children and in which they will try to assert their majority and make themselves with the management bodies of the holding firm of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez and his sons Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s David and Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a José are fine-tuning the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation over control by part of the group.
The founder of the largest business services holding company to the company does not seem willing to give in to his litigation to be present in the governing bodies of El Enebro.
From his board of directors he was run over by five of his seven children who were appointed as directors at the shareholders’ meeting on January 18 this year and whose challenge is recorded in the Commercial Register.
The judicial board of El Enebro for the next day 16, convened by the magistrate of the Mercantile Number 2 of Madrid, has opened again the box of the thunders in the bosom of the <0xC3><0x81>lvarez family.
The use of the judge to fix the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the convening of the board.
The latest move by Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira <0xC3><0x81>lvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez as a "desperate recourse of the applicants his five children to, through procedural shrewdness, in clear fraud of Law and abuse of law, try to validate and sanitize the radically null junta of January 18," according to their official spokesperson.
This argumentation will be the basis for the Board, once held, to proceed to its challenge by considering it to be "null in full law".
The same protagonists, who maintain a discreet silence, have already tried unsuccessfully for the magistrate to convene a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a heritage company and owner of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other assets, David <0xC3><0x81>lvarez’s seven children control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the services group, however, claims usufruct over 51% of the capital, according to family protocols.
This issue is the substantive issue to be decided by the judge once the hearing on the appeal is held, for which no date has yet been set.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon from Siemens
Software designs improvements to cars in real time.
Since Red Bull broke into the world of Formula One in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
At first no one took into account the options of a newly arrived team and, despite the upward trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final straight of the championship everyone bet on the victory of Ferrari Fernando Alonso.
Without depreciating the skill as a driver of the final champion, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the ability of the Renault engine that propels his car, in the world of Formula 1 has become a legend the "secret weapon" that the multinational Siemens has put in the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team.
It is actually a powerful process simulation software that the German put on the market in 2007 for purposes far away from high automotive competition.
Called PLM, this powerful computing instrument has been used to design assembly lines from manufacturing factories around the world, power plants, high-precision instruments.
The goal is to reproduce, faithfully simulate the product or process before building it in a real way, thus avoiding avoidable failures and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of Canon’s cameras, Sukhoi’s planes or Nissan’s most celebrated utility cars.
Siegfried Russwurm, head of Siemens’ industrial division, explains that the use of this computing instrument in his Formula 1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and implement “in a few hours, almost in real time”, the modifications, changes and improvements that are detected during races and in trials.
Russwurm explains that the teams in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians on their team who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during each season.
The Red Bull team today employs 180 highly qualified young professionals who, equipped with powerful computer equipment, analyze and project all sorts of modifications to the bolides.
The CEO of Siemens explained that the PLM software is able to analyze and improve all the elements of the Red Bull bolides with the exception of the engine, which is the entire responsibility of Renault.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and safety elements are modified.
The changes can be brought from simulator virtual reality to reality in less than 24 hours, thanks to advanced laser production systems and high-tech autoclaves.
As the only limitation of this insanity of technological improvement is the $40 million figure that each Formula 1 team can spend at most in each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has set up the high-tech factory to design and produce their bolides in a town about 50 kilometres from London.
These are two buildings where visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
Everything that happens there is considered “high secret.”
The roster for this task amounts to 580 people, including its two drivers, champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
Red Bull’s Formula 1 hero is, without a doubt, the recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
Among the immense technological resources that the brand of energy drinks has put at the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other protagonists whose competition is priceless and their notoriety null.
Factory chief technology officer Steve Nevey says five years ago it could be said that R&D advances in carts accounted for 50% of victories and drivers were responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have varied and the technology adds up to 85% of the success, while the drivers contribute 15% of the added value.
Nevey acknowledges that the Vettels or Webbers will never be replaced by computer science as "they are unpredictable gladiators."
HP to set up its own 20 stores with local distributors in two years
Hewlett-Packard (HP) inaugurated yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the network of 20 stores between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational plans to install in Spain over the next two years.
The company will make this initiative compatible with the 16 areas already present in multi-brand centers such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Inglés.
The vice president of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, set as an example the remodeled store located on the Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a Barcelona, owned by Pont Reyes, with whom she has been working for 30 years.
The North American group has prepared a plan to locate 200 brand outlets in Europe in 2013, a strategy that includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first to open were Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, Barcelona being the third.
Herrero did not want to reveal the next possible openings, although he acknowledged that Madrid could be the next destination.
The director of HP personal systems said that the philosophy to install the stores will always be the same, relying on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group advises and is in charge of the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched interactively), which in Europe will have an identical image.
In addition, HP provides training for in-house staff.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the exclusive network of stores aims to "improve customer service and SMEs in the purchase, care, after-sales and even packaging".
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering worldwide pilot program that is responsible for solving potential problems of HP computer equipment under warranty.
An online service connects with a technical centre located in Maastricht (Netherlands).
“So in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can sometimes take up to two days.”
“This system is specially designed for SMEs and users, since large companies already have contracted technical assistance services,” said Helena Herrero.
Sabadell bets to 'steal' one million customers from its rivals in three years
More optimistic than other executives, Banco Sabadell CEO Jaime Guardiola believes 2011 will be a tough year for banking, but initially dismisses a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the passive war.
Nevertheless, it foresees a collapse in interest margins, which will be partly offset by increases in fees and the price of credit.
Sabadell expects to attract one million private customers in three years, its pending subject.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years in order to survive in a very complicated economic environment.
The bank will launch a new master plan in 2011 that will have a three-year term.
The goal, in addition to surviving without resorting to public aid from the FROB, is to gain market share by attracting a million new private customers - 700,000 if you discount those who can leave the bank-, its great pending subject, since until now it had spoiled SMEs and companies more than the retail customer.
This year it has captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
Its market share in particular is 3.5%, while in companies it exceeds 10%.
Another of the bases of the 2011-2013 plan is the commitment to productivity, or the same thing, of austerity, with cost reduction as a goal, and whose challenges the bank will expose when presenting the results of the year.
Few banks in these times dare to set goals and make them public as the financial crisis has disrupted all the plans of world banking.
Sabadell, in fact, will close this year its Optima master plan, set four years ago, although initially it was for three, but the situation of the markets made it expand one more exercise.
Customers who let the savings boxes escape will be their main target.
In a breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola insisted that 2011 will be a "difficult and transcendental year".
The executive, in fact, believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain "will be slow".
In two or three years it will be "very difficult to create jobs", something fundamental for the survival of the banking business, he insisted.
And while he believes that the war on liabilities – which penalizes margins – is shrinking, the price of risk premiums that banks and banks are paying for their liquidity-providing issuances is already shifting to the credit price to offset the fall in margins.
“The issue of liquidity and financing is structural, and it’s going to be a pressure factor on credit.”
“We haven’t closed the tap, but the differentials are higher,” Guardiola said.
Banesto already gave orders Thursday to his network to limit the long-term credit and raise the price of the differentials -see CincoD<0xC3><0xAD>as of 22 and 27 November.
He also acknowledged that the banking trend is now “rising commissions,” but “there is a competitive framework.”
Sabadell’s master plan is based on organic growth, although, as always, the group does not rule out corporate operations.
Not in vain, he says that in Spain "larger sizes will be required."
“Next year everything will move,” he said.
He claims that capital needs are "very high" and does not rule out that some Spanish financial institution enters in red numbers.
It points out that the FROB can supply the market in raising funds in the event of new recapitalisations.
After ensuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closure of markets, he downplayed what some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
He points out that it cannot be issued, but contrary to what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through rest, which cushions the crisis.
The ECSC rejects a second wave of mergers in the boxes
The Director-General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled out yesterday that there will be a wave of mergers of savings banks and once again insisted on the speed with which the restructuring of the sector is being carried out.
When he started the process of concentrating the Spanish savings banks, there were several entities that ensured that they would not participate in this first phase and that they would be reserved for the second round.
However, the general director of the Spanish Confederation of Savings Banks (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, ruled yesterday that this new wave of operations will occur.
“I think the biggest part of the mergers has been done, the incorporation of Cajasol into the Civic Bank group cannot be said to be a second round, what there are are adjustments.”
“Most of it is completely done; maybe instead of 17 we go to 13 or 14 but all the big processes have already been done and protected by the Bank of Spain, which has collaborated a lot in that as well,” he said.
In statements during a breakfast of the Association of Directors and Executives of Arag<0xC3><0xB3>n (ADEA), Olavarrieta has stated that the concentration process is being undertaken "at the highest possible speed, and we have to be very satisfied with how it is occurring in the deadlines that in their day, not now, were marked in the business plans with the Bank of Spain", he emphasized.
“Growing from 45 boxes with an average of 28.5 billion asset volumes to 17 with 75.5 billion is a process that has no parallel in history, reducing the number of entities by 62% to be much larger to comply with Basel,” he said.
Olavarrieta acknowledged that "there are a number of rather unlucky opinions about the slowness of the process" that demonstrate "a lack of seriousness and meaning", because "what the Bank of Spain does is to remember that we have to be within the deadline before the end of the year".
The Director General of the ECSC, José Antonio Olavarrieta, said yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system in all of Europe and "probably" in the world, and attributed to those who put it on trial a "lack of knowledge".
The executive noted that, within the current economic situation, "we can be very calm" with the situation of financial institutions and savings banks, a system that has undertaken a process of concentration "very important" and that "goes at the highest possible speed".
He also recalled that the Spanish bank came out very well from the stress tests carried out by the ECB in July.
Shoemaker and the German Red Line
Berlin has chosen to remain in the euro, but has set the conditions for the whole Union.
Tensions in the markets have led to a double government response.
On the one hand, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero has advanced new adjustment measures, from tax reductions to SMEs, regulation of private placement or suppression agencies of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of the State Lottery.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of former President Felipe Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, has joined the criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in unleashing the current crisis.
How should these movements be interpreted?
Go ahead, Merkel’s position is not a mistake in her communication policy.
On the contrary, it is another turning point in the difficult process of redefining the euro.
And there Germany has a radically new vision of what its future must be, clashing with that of maintaining the old traditions of much of its partners.
In the face of European resistance, Germany is beginning to speculate on the three possible solutions to the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, made up of itself, Austria and the Netherlands, among other countries, while the south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the framework, although now it seems science fiction, with a very favorable current of opinion, close to 50% of the population.
The third, a redesign of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigour, fines to transgressor countries, possible suspensions of payments of some of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and has been defined for a long time, so now there are no excuses.
First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German government pulled out of the sleeve a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between what Germany believed should be done (plans of fiscal rigour and stability in public finances), and what its European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second on the front was given by the Central European country when Merkel painfully extended the decision to save Greece.
It was already the subject of fierce criticism at the time, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published opinion were very much against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel again emerges with a clear position, demanding the reform of the Union treaties, to make it possible to save a country and, at the same time, force private lenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, as it has precipitated the Irish crisis and everything else.
But his proposal, although somewhat sweetened, has been approved and, in the coming months, we should be attending the process of reforming the Union to enable those measures from 2013.
Germany has drawn a red line that it does not intend to cross.
And he is telling us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which he may not agree very much, from that date the old functioning of the euro will have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which the offending countries will be severely penalized, may be forced to declare themselves in default of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also run with part of the cost.
Germany is pointing out to us that we must follow a severe growth path with high savings and investment rates, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and positive external balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that has presided over Spanish growth in the boom years, simply will not tolerate it.
The invitation is clear.
And we'd be wrong not to understand it.
It’s not just about bringing the public deficit back to 3% in 2013.
What they demand of us is much harder.
And the worst thing we could do in these circumstances is deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulence will give way to greater calm.
And let us take advantage of the window of opportunity they have given us, until the spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has understood this as well and his double manifesto (the reforms promised after last Saturday’s meeting with big companies and yesterday’s announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite criticism of Merkel, the thesis that we must put order at home has opened up.
But the red line that Germany has drawn is there, and it doesn’t look like they’re going to move it.
And, among the possibilities that are contemplated, that of leaving a monetary zone too crowded with unserious countries, can not be excluded.
Then Germany will always be able to tell us that she had already warned us.
Sport and Law Fraud
Bullies such as Alonso and Ramos before Ajax show ingenuity but not willingness to escape a penalty.
The expulsion allegedly ordered by two Real Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the match played on November 23 against Ajax in the Champions League has caused ink rivers to be written about whether such behavior is or is not anti-sports and whether, eventually, both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As is well known, in the absence of a few minutes to finish the game (which his team had already clearly won), the two players deliberately lost time in taking fouls to cause the referee to show them the second yellow card.
That way, and since Real Madrid will end up as the leader of their group, both players will comply with the regulatory sanction the next match of the league, against Auxerre, and will be able to pass clean cards to the next phase.
Finally, the UEFA disciplinary committee has sanctioned two matches for the team’s coach, José Mourinho, and different economic amounts for the players involved.
The provocation of a yellow card in circumstances such as this or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequent in the world of football.
It is so widespread that it is part of the ethos, of the unwritten rules, but followed, of this sport.
Part of the debate that arose in the reported case is due to the fact that it has been played by a team of the entity of Real Madrid (which in its anthem boasts of nobility and honor, and that in past times has fined its players for similar acts) and to the dramatization orchestrated, apparently, by Mourinho, who adds one more episode to its dilated technical history.
In any case, the debate revolves around whether this type of behavior not expressly prohibited by the regulations contradicts the principles of sport, i.e. whether these actions are a violation of the law; in fact, they are actions that are respectful of the sports regulations, but seem to circumvent their meaning.
The point is to examine the type of damage they cause to the sporting spirit.
One of the goods that comprises the sports spirit is the physical integrity of the opposing players, an aspect that with these actions was not endangered, that is, there was no violent game.
Another of these assets that is alluded to with fair play is to prevent the team of the offending players from unfairly taking advantage of the opposing team, which also did not happen.
Now, the paradox of the action of the players of Real Madrid is that he did not settle for what we normally characterize as cheating or fraud of the law, because his violation of the rules was not done in secret to try to avoid the sanction, but precisely his action tried to be the most obvious in order to receive the punishment of the referee.
They waited and gladly accepted the sanction.
Another question is what kind of advantage do the offenders gain in the intentional faults examined.
Here it seems necessary to note that the opponent is not placed in a disadvantageous situation or profit is obtained in the same game, because obviously the result of the action involves leaving the team itself with fewer players.
And it is also not a useful strategy for the next match, as the club will not be able to count on those players.
The advantage, obviously, is that players will start the next phase of the Champions League without cards that may threaten their participation in a future match.
But this is a long-term advantage, with a certain degree of indeterminacy, because the team can be eliminated at the first exchange, and also with this performance the players fulfill a penalty game and move to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by accumulation of cards occurs with a less than in the first cycle.
So, from going through rounds, it’s not so clear that it’s an advantage.
In short, these actions do not go against the spirit of sports, of which it is part to make strategic decisions that favor to make the most of what the rules allow.
In the case before us, the players did not act to evade the application of the sanction (this would be a clear case of fraud of law), but rather chose when to submit to it.
They made a strategic decision without passing the punishment or fleeing from it.
Although the line between ingenuity and law fraud is blurred, this time I think it was a clear case of ingenuity.
The controversy, it seems to me, arises from two factors: because it was about two self-expulsions and because of the way in which the transmission of the directive to provoke them was carried out.
The damage caused to the principles of the sport by these actions is not so much ethical as aesthetic.
Offensive offers to capture Christmas dinners from groups at BCN
The dictatorship of the calendar concentrates this year an avalanche of reserves for the 16th and 17th days.
Self-suffered celebrations proliferate by employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 euros.
As the company and the lottery, with the arrival of December also return the group dinners before Christmas, which continue to exercise oxygen balloon for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, but due to the crisis have led to an offensive of adjusted prices to be able to catch the majority customer: almost all sectors want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners.
To finish complicating accounting, this year’s calendar (at the fall of New Year’s Eve on Friday) has concentrated the petitions into the week of December 13, with the result to date of an avalanche of dinner reservations for peak days (the 16th and 17th) and barely movement for the previous week.
As has been the case since 2008, when the stage of lean cows began, there are many companies that have eliminated collective dinners on a budget issue.
In order not to disregard tradition, many workers keep paying it out of their own pocket.
Whatever the situation, both demand battle prices, confirms the president of the Barcelona Restoration Guild, Gaiet<0xC3><0xA0> Farr<0xC3><0xA0>s.
The representative of the employer, to this day, does not dare to vaticinize what the celebrations of this month will be.
"People think about it a lot before booking."
“He wants to go out but he has the alerts on the price issue,” he says.
The business will go well "to those who give quality at a good price and with good service", he adds, and remembers that customers tend to take a step down with the crisis, so that the band around 25 euros has become the majority in demand.
In a survey in various central establishments, the collapse of petitions for the night of the 17th is noted.
In the group Soteras indicate that there is a real boom of requests for that Friday, with the intention of spending less than 30 euros, to which they have responded by adapting their menus to the situation, with complete formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Fonda and others), the peculiarity of the calendar has brought more advance reservation, even since the beginning of November.
“We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros”, they detail.
In AN Grup, which will take El Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to a total of 23 locations, they remain optimistic after detecting a surge in turnover since the second half and good, though concentrated, business prospects for Christmas.
Sources from the group point out that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of groups of friends who pre-celebrate the parties.
To its six group menus have added a Christmas one, with the 30 euros or more as a star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for demanding more details, such as cava.
They also see green outbreaks in some companies that re-invite their employees and a feeling that the volume of the groups is somewhat higher.
On the part of the boss Fecasarm (which includes entities such as the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona), its vice president, Enric Gom<0xC3><0xA0>, trusts to start seeing the end of the tunnel and maintains that together the reservations are "animated", although the customers "negotiate to the maximum".
That is, the illusion for the festivities has not gone down, whoever pays, indicates.
Pakistan's nuclear program raises serious concerns in US
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at “a faster pace than any other country.”
WikiLeaks leaks confirm ties between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondence between the U.S. embassy in Pakistan and the U.S. State Department leaked by the WikiLeaks portal confirms the huge concerns that the Pakistani nuclear program causes in Washington.
Aside from the enlightening and juicy details they offer about the content of the conversations and thoughts of U.S. diplomatic representatives accredited in Islamabad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries on nuclear security, rather than going up, “decreases,” and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons “at a faster rate than any other country.”
The peculiarity of Pakistan's nuclear program - that weapons are not assembled but remain stored by components to make it difficult to destroy in the event of an attack - is one of the main reasons for the unveiling in Washington.
The ambassador to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, listed it in a report ahead of the visit of then National Security Adviser James Jones: “The proximity of some nuclear facilities to territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of nuclear materials, and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials.”
The high number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missile programs is contemplated, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as a proliferator and a reason to keep watch.
"Pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs to protect nuclear facilities; given the fall in educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people who work in nuclear or missile programs," Russian Foreign Ministry expert Yuri Korolev said at a meeting with his U.S. counterparts.
The latest in the documentation leaked by Julian Assange’s portal is the ever-increasing cooperation between the US and Pakistan on nuclear proliferation issues and Pakistan’s high rate of nuclear weapons production.
A statement from the embassy in May, which described the communication with Pakistan as "frustrating", said: "Transparency is often non-existent; offers of help remain unanswered or are discarded."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, a national intelligence official for South Asia, notes that “despite the economic catastrophe, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons at a faster rate than any other country in the world.”
Ambassador Patterson also calls on Washington, during a visit by the head of the army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to make “very clear” to the official that “the Pakistan Army must end the tacit support of terrorist groups.”
In the hunt for the head of WikiLeaks
Obama appoints a senior counterterrorism official to prevent further leaks.
Interpol issues a red alert in order to follow the movements and locate Assange wherever he is.
Everything related to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to be sure of the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued a “red alert” to “locate and follow Assange’s movements.”
However, this is not a traditional arrest warrant.
Also, it is not new, but dates from November 20.
And it has nothing to do with the latest leak of more than a quarter of a million U.S. diplomatic documents but with the allegations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
Mark Stephens, a lawyer for WikiLeaks founder Mark Stephens, said: “The police know where and how to get in touch with Mr Assange.”
It was the 20th day when the international police force based in Lyon (France) issued the order at the request of Sweden, but did not reveal it until yesterday, after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country.
Interpol’s 188 countries have indications of identifying or locating Assange “with a view to his provisional arrest and extradition.”
Although Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, many of the member countries, the organization has explained, do consider the so-called “notice” network free to proceed with an arrest – which must be committed by the national police force – especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case in Sweden and England, where Assange is believed to be.
The move has outraged Assange’s lawyers, who published a letter yesterday denouncing that the 39-year-old WikiLeaks founder has been willing to answer questions from Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Assange requested and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the prosecutor of his case, which they compare to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, Stalin’s head of security.
“This looks like a hunt, not a legal persecution,” the letter said.
As the world searches for him – and from Australia his mother defends his son’s innocence – Assange remains in unknown but not silent whereabouts.
On Monday, he gave an indefinite interview to Time magazine’s director via Skype, a conversation in which he called for the resignation of U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
“If it can be shown that he was responsible for ordering U.S. diplomats to spy on the UN in violation of international treaties that the U.S. has signed, he should resign,” he said.
His opinion was debunked yesterday by White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, who called the resignation request "ridiculous and absurd."
“I’m not entirely sure why we should care about a guy’s opinion with a website,” he told CNN.
Obama himself has tasked a senior counterterrorism official, Russell Travers, with preventing further leaks of documents.
President Barack Obama’s attempt to detract from Assange contrasts with views that politicians and conservative commentators proclaim these days.
Peter King, the congressman who will chair the National Security Committee in the lower house from January, has asked the State Department to study the possibility of including WikiLeaks in the list of terrorist organizations “to intervene and their funds and prosecute anyone of any contribution or assistance to them.”
Further on, Tom Flanagan, an adviser to Canadian President Stephen Harper, has had to retract after saying Assange should “be killed.”
“Obama should make it a target and use an unmanned plane or something.”
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, former Arkansas governor and possible presidential candidate.
"Anyone in the government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything other than execution would be too kind a punishment," he told Fox News.
Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seeks peace in ERC with winks to the likes of Carod
The Republican leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and the end of the assembly system.
Joan Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s seems to have found the recipe to bypass the eleventh internal revolt in the ranks of the ERC, without north for the loss of 11 deputies and half the votes.
The president of the party is aware that his hiding place of resignation is insufficient for the relatives of the former leader Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector is today as diluted as his own mentor and that it can not cause him the headaches that he had with other extinct currents.
Therefore, the leader of Esquerra will try to win over new critics with winks that allow him to shield himself until the municipal elections.
For starters, Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s announced yesterday that the more than 200 national councilors of ERC will be able to pronounce on its continuity in secret.
By hand, not by hand.
If the cardiologists want to convey a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do so without fear of reprisals.
In fact, the leader wants to avoid the image of division as much as that of submission to his person.
In several interviews, he claimed that he would not be considered ratified with half plus one of the votes, but added, without specifying percentages, that it would not be a good result "to the Bulgarian."
Those close to Carod demand more from the president than to make his office available to the militancy, a gesture that is not valid when Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s controls the highest organ between congresses.
But as they do not have enough majority to force resignations, they will try to agree with the executive on a roadmap by May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the management will submit to the vote of the national council on the 18th.
Their intention is to endorse Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s in exchange for him promising to advance the congress to the fall of 2011, something that the summit already takes for granted.
The ERC leader acknowledged that the "polyphony" harms stability and that his goal is to make the organization, once and for all, be able to wash the dirty door cloths inward.
In this line, it is symptomatic the article that the acting director Josep Huguet signed in his blog.
Considered the ideologist of Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s, the head of Innovation took for granted that the leader will be endorsed "in exchange for various objectives".
And he listed five of them, two of which stand out.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the militancy, that is, include new faces from the sector related to Carod.
The second may be the big news.
Huguet proposes that ERC liquidate assembly as a mechanism of operation.
Thus, it advocates a reform of the statutes that allows congresses to be held through delegates elected by suffrage.
To end the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish match system, has been an obsession of the Puigcerc<0xC3><0xB3>s team, which has already fought in this direction in the last two congresses.
In fact, the convulsive conclave of 2008 left the charge to the management to revise the assembly at a specific congress of reform of statutes.
This date is still pending, because the internal tide of recent years advised against facing the issue.
Now, without critical sectors to stalk, it can be a good time to take it back and try to shut it down forever.
23 executed in November; 290 during 2010
According to the count of MILENIO State of Mexico there was a decrease of four cases compared to 2010.
During November, 23 people were executed in the State of Mexico, four fewer than the previous month according to the content of MILENIO Estado de México.
Among the murders are that of three women and the finding of a pair of bodies fenced in the Valley of Mexico.
In the penultimate month of the year, there were 390 deaths allegedly related to organized crime.
Among the cases is that of a corpse found in San Diego de los Padres Cuexcontitl<0xC3><0xA1>n, municipality of Toluca.
The subject had at least three gunshots and the graceful shot to the head in addition to the feet and hands tied with cable.

A day later in Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl, a 50-year-old man, he was killed by eight bullets after leaving his home to start garbage collection work.
On November 7, two 30-year-old subjects were shot in the head each in the colony of San Pedro Xaloxtoc, municipality of Ecatepec.
In Chalco, with the shot of grace on the forehead was found the corpse of a man on a lonely road of the Colonia El Naranjo and under the body they found a cap struck with a firearm calibre 25.
In Ecatepec, parts of a human body were found in the blackwater channel of the colony Playa Golondrina.

Neighbors of Tepotzotl<0xC3><0xA1>n warned about the finding of a corpse that was in the Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Colorada area, which was tied from the hands back and with its head bandaged.
The man had a gunshot wound to the back of his neck.
In the middle of the month, the execution of two men was reported, who were wrapped in blankets and abandoned in the trunk of a vehicle in the streets of the fractionation Villas de la Hacienda in the municipality of Atizap<0xC3><0xA1>n de Zaragoza, along with the victims were also discovered two messages of death warnings.
A day later, a cardboard box containing a human head was found in the Valle de los Reyes colony, in the municipality of Los Reyes La Paz.
In a nearby colony he was found wrapped in a black plastic bag the rest of the body with a message signed by El Incorrigible.
On the 17th, wrapped in blankets, two women were found dead in the village of Zoquiapan in the municipality of Ixtapaluca and the next morning the body of a man in Huixquilucan was located who was wrapped in a yellow blanket with blue, allegedly identified with the name of Mario Rios according to a message that his executors sent him.

In the woman's skin were detected tattoos of the Holy Death, as well as necklaces with his image.
In the last part of the month, the body of a man in the municipality of Zinacantepec was found on board a car with at least three gunshot wounds and a message signed by a criminal group.
Two days later, the bodies of a pair of men with their heads girded and a message were found in the community of Puente de Piedra, in Santiago Tepatlaxco.
In front of the bodies was a message allegedly signed by a criminal organization that said, "This happens to those who don't align."
In Ecatepec, with signs of torture and tied feet and hands, two bodies were found inside an abandoned taxi behind the Justice Center of the colony of San Agust<0xC3><0xAD>n.
On the last day of the month the bodies of two men were found in the municipalities of Los Reyes La Paz, and Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yotl.
The first of them was beheaded in the colony Cuchilla Anc<0xC3><0xB3>n and was wrapped in black plastic bags, tied with cinnamon tape and next to a message; while, the second was tortured and found in a plastic bag in the streets of the Colonia Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez.
Next to him the agents found a postcard with a message.
China keeps targets to reduce greenhouse gases
The representative of that country at the COP16 said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon footprint and detailed that it supports its offer to reduce by 2020 between 40 and 45 percent its greenhouse gas emissions.
China keeps its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 percent by 2020, Su Wei, the country’s representative at COP16, said.
In his first public appearance at the 16th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP16), Su Wei said that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce its carbon footprint and to reconvert its industry.
In fact, he said, over the past four years his country has invested $245 million in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he made it clear that China would not change its objectives, but would continue to work together with the international community on that issue.
He noted that China’s climate change strategy is divided into four headings: dialogue; capacity building; institution building and support for pilot programmes.
In all these areas, progress has been made, including the adoption last year of a new Energy Act, which sets out the proposed targets for reducing gas emissions, he explained.
On the other hand, he stressed that in China, federal authorities have been working in a coordinated way with state and local authorities, to achieve the goals of energy saving, energy efficient use and emission reduction.
In addition, it has abounded, is underway or has already completed several multi-year plans, both funded by the Chinese government and by governments of other countries.
For example, he said, the Energy Efficiency Programme, which was implemented over the past five years and received investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and private initiative.
A provincial climate change project is also underway, another for the change of incandescent focus to savers and one more mitigation and adaptation, he detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, the country’s government’s scientific adviser on climate change, said China’s efforts have been greater than generally thought.
For example, he explained, per capita greenhouse gas emissions in China are six tons per person, while in the United States it is 100 tons; China is responsible for 9 percent of the historical contribution to pollution.
It has also made unprecedented efforts in energy use, such as increasing energy efficiency by 20 percent over the past five years and plans to do so much more by 2020.
Attached to the legality expulsion of Espino: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the former Panist leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to claim what is appropriate to his right.
The national leader of the PAN, César Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, assured that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was attached to legality and that the former Panist leader is in his right to go to the Commission of National Order to claim what suits his right.
In an interview prior to Gabino Cué Monteagudo’s protest as governor of the state, he said that in any case the expulsion of Espino is a decision taken at the local level.
"This is an autonomous decision of the Sonora Order Commission."
"Mr. Espino has the right to appeal to the National Council Commission of Orders, if any, in such a way that it is a decision taken within the scope of a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that there was never at the negotiating table an alliance for the presidential candidacy.
Nava V<0xC3><0xA1>zquez said he was convinced that Acci<0xC3><0xB3>n Nacional will be strengthened from the internal election of December 4 and 5, in which his successor will have to be elected.
“That (an alliance in 2012) is a topic that was never on the negotiating table, at least not for now, it was an approach to the local election that was successful and met the goal,” he said.
The Panist leader said that the PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, so "we are not afraid of internal competition; on the contrary, we "enjoy and strengthen it," he said.
He said that the council will no doubt know how to choose the best or the best leader who requires National Action for the next three years, hence he will hand over the spoils "to whoever the council determines."
“I have that absolute calm and openness, any of the five would be proud to hand over the office of the party president.”
He predicted that the rebound that the party recorded in the last elections of July 4 will be reflected in the upcoming contests, although "it is not yet time to think about 2012."
"For now it's about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué on this task."
In this context, he stressed that the three governments emanating from alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the flag and will be the subject of observation throughout the country, hence that "many hopes, desires are put in them, and I am sure that Gabino will live up to expectations".
Asked about the PRI’s criticism of President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n for his speech during the four years of his government, César Nava called on the Priists to reflect on the six-year-olds of former presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
“If the PRI thinks that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n, let them start defending them, let them get out of the closet,” he said.
He believed that the head of the Federal Executive can make expressions like those he made in his speech at the National Auditorium, because there is no jaw or much less censorship in the country.
Obama on Twitter promotes law in favor of undocumented students
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and install them to pass this legislation,” Trump tweeted.
President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilization in support of the Dream Act, to legalize undocumented students, with a message on his personal Twitter account.
“If you agree that passing the Dream Act is appropriate, call your senators and install them to pass this legislation,” Obama tweeted.
His brief message keeps a cyber link open to a broader document that asks the public to communicate immediately with the senators, given that the vote on the legislation is imminent.
“With a vote expected to happen soon, now is the time to make your voice heard,” he says.
The message was released after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote on any legislation, unless the extension of Bush-era tax cuts and government funding is approved.
Such a blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Asked about the Republican blockade of the Dream Act and other bills, presidential spokesman Robert Gibbs said that once the tax issue is resolved, a timetable can be set for the rest of the bills.
"I think there is a lot of time..."
"We all agree that we have to settle the tax matter before the end of the year..."
"I think we can reach an agreement at some point on that and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," he said.
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced Tuesday that he would call for a “close-down vote” for the Dream Act, so the initiative to legalize undocumented students could be voted on in the Senate starting next Thursday, though it is more likely next week.
The Senate version of the Dream Act would legalize about 800,000 young people who entered the United States before age 16, have stayed in the country for the past five years, and entered a higher education institution or the military.
But supporters require 60 votes to pass the initiative, so they require the contest of a handful of Republicans, at a time when organizations supporting the project are playing an intense lobbying role to ensure the passage of the law.
Democrats, most of whom support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska, has said he will vote against, and only one Republican has voiced his support for the law, Richard Place of Indiana.
That’s why supporters of the Dream Act require several Republicans to join in case other Democrats decide to turn their backs on the initiative.
Among the most courted Republicans are Senators from Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as outgoing Senator George Lemieux of Florida, who completed Senator Mel Martinez’s term.
Other Republicans who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch of Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson of Texas, but have said they will not support it on another occasion.
Another Republican he supported, John McCain, has not defined his stance at this time.
Although the House of Representatives has a different version, analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the biggest hurdles in the Senate.
With literature put the finger on the sore
The second round of The Pleasures of Language was a walk where participants gala the narration
"Eso de El sexo en la lengua (Sex in the tongue I understand it but... the finger in the sore? what is expected of me?), asked the writer Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second round of Les pleasures de la lengua, a cycle that celebrates literature in Spanish and that this time she used the subtitle of her question (in another fair, Ellendio explained the round table).
The finger in the wound... "puts us in a tight spot", sweetly said the Argentine writer to the audience, mostly young, who met at the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and where Valenzuela, Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez, Mayra Montero and Luis participated.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text that she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would later define as a great story, with Luisa in the first person as the protagonist who, in search of knowing what the "band" is, goes from doctor to doctor, from which she does not get answers although she does get clues in the same narrative thread.
From the infectologist comes the conviction: "patience is not my forte, perhaps it is my sore."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the traumatologist who has stolen his breath in the middle of the hallway, but who clarifies that sore is not a scientific term; it is the psychoanalyst who reveals the mystery: "the wound is the real open, the symbolic is the scar."
The protagonist sighed with relief and concluded "from the wound I only managed to know that it is the real open and that it does not exist", but convinced that the pleasures and traps of the tongue must go very far.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez also exhibited a delightful narrative that he titled Praise for the Invention, where the finger in the wound is not named but at a moment it is discovered.
With brushstrokes of magical realism, the story of a famous sorceress, who also played clouds, brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues that a maiden would have lost, a narrative that turned to speak later America, the great novel that from the beginning did not lack its own chroniclers who would tell it and quoted the former critics Bernal Ca<0xC3><0xAD>az.
“Cervantes who invented us all (the writers) made fun of the fake witnesses who appeared in the stories presented as real, but otherwise you would never have been able to tell the story of America with imagination that was lacking to the point of shame.”
However, he stressed "it is the madmen and the embusters who best imagine" and it is where reality and lie converge, where it is no longer known that the narrative belongs to one side or the other, where the literature of fiction reaches its peak.
It’s called the “Cervantine Tradition.”
"By His inheritance we are told."
In her turn, the writer Mayra Montero softened and applauded the variety of interpretations that the FIL invitation gave with her round table The finger in the sore.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed her to the great scourge of social violence that runs through her country - and shares Latin America - the product of the disputes of drug trafficking and sale.
"I believe that good literature, good poetry, good songs enclose a tacit commitment that is of course not premeditated," he said, citing that the reality of literature is communication and the dimension of the commitment that is established between author and readers, and that in a "chemical reaction" of the latter.
The evening was closed by the Spanish poet Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a Montero whose intervention also emphasized "that finger in the wound of the committed writer of the writer".
He considered that in a world that lives in a hurry, also in intellectual customs and control of consciences that leads to dogmatisms, forgetting "that behind every affirmation there is a little no and behind every denial there is a little yes."
“To own our thinking and to own reality we have to nuance: and nuance means many times to put a finger on the sore and annoy those people who are much more comfortable thinking about caricature, in black and white, in established ideas and without nuance and annoy also the powers that prefer a black and white world,” he said, inviting to recall.
Romano goes for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in the finals, has had ups and downs in his career, but has already managed to reach the decisive series on three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, they also face two different styles marked by their technicians, who find each other with a contrast marked by the results.
Rubén Omar Romano has three losses in the finals, he has had ups and downs in his career, but he has already managed to reach the decisive series three times, although so far he has gone blank and that is why this occasion is very special for him.
The Argentine has ended up consoled with the runner-up’s medal, has been a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team has played consecutive finals.
The strategist reached his first final as a coach in the 2002 Apertura Tournament, when he was leading the Morelia with which he fell 4-2 overall against Toluca; later, in the 2003 Clausura he also reached the decisive duel and also lost it with 3-1 overall and was precisely against Rayados.
Already with Santos Laguna, in the Bicentennial Tournament 2010, again against the Diablos, Rubén suffered a setback again, as his team ended up tied 2-2 against the choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the penalty shootout he was put in front by 3-1 with two chances to seal the title for finally three players their failures passed 11 from their failures.
Ruben has already lost two finals with the Red Devils and one with Monterrey, his rival in turn, therefore does not want to run the same luck, seeks to get rid of the curse and be able to celebrate for the first time a title, although he claims that for him the most important thing is the institution.
"I want to be a champion, I don't want to break any statistics, this is for a club, for a hobby to which I owe myself and consequently the title will come for me, but the above is the most important thing," he said when questioned about the numbers he has against playing in the finals.
Very current has the previous final, which, he says, has learned a lot, "the only teaching we can have is that until the referee whistles the end we can not celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because the previous time, with two penalties to throw we were already prepared to go running and I think that's a lesson, until the fest is finished".
Knowing that this series could be defined in penalty shots, something that does not bother him, because he trusts in his players: "One never seeks to get to the penalty shootout, one seeks to finish in regular time, but sometimes there is no other and you have to be prepared, in the previous tournament we were prepared, unfortunately we made a bad move, the fate, sometimes we have to be nervous."
Romano has it in his hands to stop being a technical subchampion and to try for the first time the glory that the titles give.
EU changes rules for obtaining visas
Individuals must visit the Visa Applicant Service Centers prior to their interview in the Consular Section; the cost will be lower and the waiting time will be shorter.
As of January 10, 2011, the procedure for processing a visa at the U.S. Embassy and consulates will change.
With the new procedure, most applicants will need to go to the Visa Applicant Service Centers (ASC) before their interview in the Consular Section.
ASC staff will take the applicant’s biometric information, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section prior to the interview.
The new procedure will have certain advantages for applicants, including:
The total cost of processing the visa will be lower, it will no longer be necessary to make a payment to arrange the appointment, another payment to process the visa application and another for the courier service to deliver the document.
The applicant will only make a single payment that will cover all three services.
The current fee will remain unchanged: the equivalent of $140 for a tourist visa, $150 for on-demand visa cases (including temporary worker visas) and $390 for merchant and investor visas.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but will only go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and take their fingerprints.
Because biometric information will be taken at the ASC, applicants who require a second appointment to be interviewed at the Consular Section will remain in the ASC for less time than in the past.
Also, those applying for visas at the Consulates in Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra service fee of $26.

NASA Announces Discovery of Extraterrestrial Life
The U.S. space agency quoted the press as presenting a finding tomorrow that will have an impact on the search for living beings in space.
The U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will unveil an astrobiological discovery Thursday that could prove the theory that extraterrestrial life does exist.
The finding will be presented at a press conference Thursday at 1:00 p.m. at NASA Headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science described as tasked with studying the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
Citing the press, NASA said it will present "a finding that will have an impact on the search for extraterrestrial life," prompting speculation from experts from other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures on our side and in hostile environments that were thought uninhabitable, and would put on the table the possibility of them becoming intelligent beings like humans if they improve the conditions in which they live.
It appears to be a microbe that was found at the bottom of Mono Lake in Yosemite National Park, California, where it lives in an environment that was thought to be too poisonous for any form of life, as the lake is rich in arsenic.
Somehow, the creature uses arsenic as a way to survive and from this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets, which do not have our benevolent atmosphere.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be shown that "yes there is another way of life, a second way of life, different from the one we know."
The space agency will unveil the true scope of the findings at Thursday’s press conference.
The conference will be attended by geobiologist Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life on Mars; and biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (Saturn's largest moon), from the perspective that its chemistry is similar to that of Earth.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Pattern 'block' opponent
With reforms to the Organic Law of Congress, it gives rise to the arrival of 'bipartisanism', they denounce.
The 60th Legislature was not installed when an opposition bloc emerged in the Congress, headed by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Manuel Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, who declared themselves independent, and the four questioned one thing: the arrival of 'bipartisanship' in the House.
Before the start of the installation session of the 60 Legislature, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergencia; Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of the PRD; and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, 'tronaban' against the reform of the Organic Law, since it excluded them.
With this reform, they reiterated, begins the 'bipartisanship', because now it will be two people, of equal number of parties, who will control the Congress.
These four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones who voted against the Board of Directors, headed by the breadwinner Salvador L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Brito and Luis Antonio C<0xC3><0xA1>rdenas Fonseca, in his capacity as vice-president.
Corvera Quevedo, explained that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality on the part of the PRI and PAN.
He said that in the coming days they will talk to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to modify the scheme, starting from a political will, and if they do not have it, then they will be ambushed again by both parties and thus the opposition coalition ended.
“So far [the opposition coalition] has arrived, it’s what I look at, because we are excluded from any decision, they don’t even have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.”
Felipe Manzanarez Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, of Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n, there are coincidences and therefore they are forming a plural group.
It cannot be allowed, he continued, that Congress, after having been monopolistic, is now “duopolitical.”
“It is not the spirit of law reform that there is eternal bipathism in Congress.”
To begin with, this group is starting with 5 legislators, and they are talking to other peers to be more, the convergent abounded.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza, of the PT, explained that currently the Congress has become a “bottle” between two, in allusion to the PAN and PRI.
“Before it was just a game, now they’re dividing it between two.”
Patr<0xC3><0xB3>n Montalvo, asked to respect the personality of the member, to give him his place at the negotiating tables.
"Not by cupular agreements, let alone 5 that we are probably going to make 9 deputies, now the five that see us, separated into different factions, we have decided to unite to look for a place at the negotiating table, that is the issue that in the reform that they did that they agreed, we are out and we do not agree with that reform."
$200,000 more for "the supplier"
Pay Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n City Council another check to the disputed owner of an electrical equipment company.
A check for just over 200,000 pesos in favor of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount that has been paid in this second half to the owner of the electric material company, amounts to 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
According to the transparency page of the Municipality, this last check number 9258447 was issued on November 16, for the amount of 200 thousand 144.56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts to be paid".
The Treasurer Luis Miguel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Moreno had advanced that more money would come out of the Commune in favor of this supplier, which was observed by the Superior Audit of the State for selling at a higher price.
What has not been reported is the total that is still owed to him and, therefore, how many more checks are missing to be issued in favor of Camacho Palazuelos.
“Nothing has been bought, you’re just being paid what you owe, just like the rest of the suppliers,” he said in an interview.
The last checks "reappeared" in the last quarter of the year: September 24, two on October 15, October 19, October 29, and the last on November 16.
Although the provider has not yet been published in the State Official Gazette, as the Law states when a company is questioned by the ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using their services, the Treasurer assured that they have not used their services again.
The above, after on July 25, Noroeste published a revision to the checks issued by the City Council to its suppliers, in which it was revealed that, from March 2008 to July 9, 2010, in the triennium of Mayor Jorge Abel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, Camacho Palazuelos paid the Municipality more than 10 million pesos.
He also transacted with Jumapam, where he collected cheques for more than 3 million pesos.
Urgency to attend tourist sites
Tourist entrepreneurs regret foreign tourist accident for poor conditions of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada in Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a sinking of the Glorieta S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlan asked the authorities to pay attention to areas and sites that are in poor condition and that project a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Merchants of the Golden Zone, recalled that on different occasions they have denounced that they take care of the image of the destination and reverse the bad that tourists find with new activities or routes.
He said the poor condition of the streets and sidewalks has affected because tourists come for a walk and see the mess and take him back to nearby businesses.
“Politicians don’t know what it’s like to close a company one day and have no idea how much money is lost, or else they wouldn’t do the work in this way in such a long time and without proper planning.”
The hotelier José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the lack of prevention and maintenance by the City Council.
"The municipality will have to assume its responsibility and prevent it from happening again, how to do it since giving preventive maintenance and not fall into the corrective alone," he said.
“We are eager to enjoy a clean city, because not only because it is a tourist area must be given maintenance, but as inhabitants we deserve a clean place to live and the City Council must change its strategy to keep the city well.”
There are other sites that also look neglected and incomplete, he said, such as the Shield and the Venadito of Mazatlan.
"Today, for the tourist to come does not depend solely on the promotion, there has to be a good product, a city that has cleanliness on its beaches, on its avenues, permanent maintenance in what are the tourist attractions," he said.
"There has been no proper attention given and this type of fact highlights something that is notorious by everyone, maintenance is needed."
Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Llera Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez, Undersecretary of Tourism Promotion, said that the rescue of tourist sites in Mazatlan is urgent, as they are not used correctly and project a bad image.
He talked about a number of places that should be put in line in conjunction with the municipality and be a priority to have the city up to date, clean, orderly and that is attractive because it is of tourist vocation.
"Fortunately Mazatlan offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be ordered first, cleaned up and put online to make them attractive to add to the inventory we have to promote to the destination."
Ask Congress for IP Results
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos, president of the CCE, proposed that the deputies assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
A work-worthy legislature free of party and state executive agreements demands Mazatl<0xC3><0xA1>n’s business sector, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that faces major problems.
Since yesterday, the 60th legislature, consisting of seven political forces, 19 members of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of the PRD, one of the PT, one of Convergence and one more of the PVEM, totaling a total of 40 popular representatives, has been installed.
Among the list of expectations of the new members of the State Congress is that they come to carry out a clean management and commitment to society and to the different sectors that require responsible legislative work and that do not repeat the same patterns of partisanship or paternalism.
Eduardo D<0xC3><0xA1>valos Zamora, President of the Business Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly-released 40 deputies of the State Congress assume the great responsibility of being an example of seeing for a better Sinaloa for the various challenges it faces.
“We hope that MPs will really exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties because it is customary to make arrangements to ensure their own interests and become carnival comparsors of the rulers and leaders of parliamentary factions.”
That is why he spoke of certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that bring the Governor forward in turn.
"We take care that they come to do a decent job and above all committed to society and to the sectors because it was the Sinaloa that gave them the vote of confidence in the last elections."
José Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Manguart S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, president of the Association of Three Islands Hotels, considered that one of the great challenges of the 40 popular representatives is to push and join forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because today the economic situation is very complicated.
“The most important thing is that they push economic growth, that they generate incentives for investment and infrastructure and that in some way will encourage job generation.”
As for tourism activity, he demanded that the new legislators give him the weight he has within the state budget to strengthen the State Secretary of Tourism.
"I understand that it is the second Secretariat in the state with a lower budget and is incongruous as an important economic activity and generating foreign exchange and investment and that it directly competes with the agro-industry."
In addition, it is required to label resources to detonating tourist projects and that help in providing security to the state and in updating the Alcohol Law that have not been able to resolve in previous legislatures.
We are looking for a magic king.
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among other toys, are the longing of the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next Kings Day will be difficult to please their illusions, since their home is made up of nothing more and nothing less than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaide, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaiah, José Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melchor, Gaspar and Baltazar will give them the toys and clothes they so desire.
The family lives in a humble house of the Salvador Allende Colony and live up to date because the father does not have a fixed job.
"Because sometimes we see it hard because my husband has no champa, but we sell mandarin and papa... already in the afternoon I go out with the 'plebes' to sell to the street," said Cayetana Valenzuela Andrade, mother of the little ones.
Adelaide, 4, wants a doll or a bicycle, while her sister Isabel, 3, would like a Barbie doll.
For his part, José Alfredo, 10 years old, has long aspired to have a 'monster' car and for his 8-month-old brother Jesus, Cayetana suggests clothes size for a year.
"He said to me (Joseph Alfredo), 'I would like this monster', but I said 'let's see son', because it was very expensive," he recalled with sadness Cayetana.
For older children, who were in school, clothes and shoes would be ideal.
Maria Guadalupe, 11, is size 12; Isaiah, 10, is size 10, while Michael, 8, wears size eight.
Jose Juan, 14, lacks tennis, so a pair of size five and a half or six would be a lot of help.
If you want to help make the dream come true for the children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the campaign Seeking a Magician, donating a toy or cash at the Northwest Reception.
Fourteen suspected drug traffickers arrested
On Wednesday, in Estrie, a dozen persecutions have been carried out as part of the dismantling of a network of production and sale of Cannabis.
Fourteen people have been arrested and will face various charges.
The persecutions have occurred in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mainly in the places where the drug was produced.
“Around 750 cannabis plants, four kilos of hashish, money and equipment for production have been seized,” said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a Quebec security spokesman.
In total, eleven men and three women have been arrested, including the two alleged network leaders, two men from Sherbrooke.
The detainees had to appear at Sherbrooke's courthouse in the hours following their arrest.
They could face accusations of cannabis production, possession for the purpose of trafficking, conspiracy and theft of services, among others.
These persecutions have occurred after a long investigation that has lasted about a year.
“It was the information provided by the public that allowed us to carry out the arrests,” said Mr. Ruel.
About 70 officers from the Estrie investigation module of Quebec Security, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Memphremagog Police Department participated in this police operation.
It will be able to fight illegal migration without problems
The Conservatives’ bill, which the government says should solve the problem of fathers loaded with illegal migrants, will surely face a major opposition, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they could not support it.
"I rely mainly on the Charter."
“I am here with a party that has created the granite you are treading,” said Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by MPs after the weekly caucus meeting.
The Liberals argue that the bill in its current form, which would allow anyone from a ship identified as transporting illegal immigrants to be detained for up to a year, violates the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
The leader of the Quebec Bloc, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that he could not support the bill because it points to the wrong target.
"We are against it and, it seems, all the opposition parties are against the project, so we will see what the government does," Duceppe said.
The NPD’s criticism of immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected criticism that her party is not firm enough with illegal immigrants.
“The neo-democrats agree that measures should be taken against those in charge of the clandestine paternities and that is what we intend with another bill, the C-35,” says Mrs Chow.
“We don’t support the Conservatives’ bill because it attacks refugees and jails children for a minimum of one year,” Chow said.
Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has accused the parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canadians.
"The vast majority of Canadians tell MPs that they do not tolerate this kind of clandestine migration, these criminal operations against Canada and that they treat the country as if it were a hoodlum."
“They expect Canada to take firm action,” said Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on its bill, which could lead the country to elections as a result of its rejection.
However, a conservative has told the QMI Agency that the government was going to ask for a vote to be held so that each MP who is going to oppose it will be explained later to his voters.
The new unity does not achieve unanimity
Although Jean Charest had announced the possible establishment of a permanent anti-corruption and collusion unit, numerous observers continued to call for the establishment of a public consultation commission on the issue.
The Minister of Public Security, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea has not been raised two days ago: Quebec would have consulted with the Department of Investigation in New York this issue since January last year.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
As a result, Tuesday’s announcement has caught more than one by surprise.
It should be noted that, during a meeting of the Standing Council on Quebec Police Services held on 29 October, this measure was never discussed despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
That was enough for the critic of the Quebec party dealing with the issue of public safety, Stéphane Bergeron, to call this announcement "a rabbit taken out of the chimney" and "a last-minute snap solution."
Minister Dutil, for his part, has responded to those who fear that political power has too much influence over possible future unity.
“You’ll see the results when we announce it,” he says.
"We are aware of this problem."
For the president of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, there is nothing that can replace the launch of a public survey.
"The more Mr. Charest insists on avoiding the creation of this commission of inquiry, the more people share our opinion, that is, that he has something to hide," he explains.
“The only way to have a commission of inquiry is with the resignation of Jean Charest,” explains Yves Boisvert, professor of ethics and governance at the National School of Public Administration.
To get out of this deadlock, he suggested that Quebec should grant a special mandate to the Advocate General to conduct a survey on collusion and corruption.
"We must be able to extend the mandate of the general intervener," he concludes.
It also considers that Quebec could give the intervener the same powers as a commissioner, thus allowing him to force people to testify.
The creation of a permanent squad is not the only project under way in the Charest Government.
Quebec also requests Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to better adapt to this type of crime.
This request appears to come from the prosecutor of Operation Marteau, who has informed Justice Minister Jean-Marc Fournier that the case law is not explicit in such investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed that his Justice counterpart, Rob Nicholson, is currently inclined to make certain amendments in this regard.
During the Spring 2001 operation related to motorcycle groups, 131 people were arrested, although the Criminal Code had not been adapted.
Subsequently, Ottawa pushed for the adoption of the Gangsterism Act.
Rivers under extreme surveillance
Several waterways are being closely monitored due to heavy rainfall that has been recorded in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
On Wednesday afternoon, a landslide occurred in Shawinigan, Mauricie.
As a precautionary measure, the houses have been evacuated.
At night, another landslide occurred in Saint-Lin-Laurentides, in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
A road collapsed.
From Tuesday to Wednesday night, several regions recorded heavy rainfall, between 40 and 70 millimeters of rain.
Also, an additional 20 to 40 millimeters are expected from now through Thursday night, depending on the region.
The sectors north of the river and in the Outaouais valley were the most affected.
They could receive up to a total of 100 millimeters of rain.
Since these precipitations add to the melting of snow that had already accumulated in certain sectors, it is feared that various rivers will overflow.
On Wednesday evening, the Civil Security Unit of Quebec issued alerts for the Ouareau and Achigan rivers in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
The rivers of the north, in Saint-Jér<0xC3><0xB4>me, in the Laurentians, and of the Ch<0xC3><0xAA>ne, in Lotbini<0xC3><0xA8>re, have already caused floods in the past and are under surveillance.
In the Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re region, heavy rainfall has caused some lakes to overflow in Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, heavy rains have drawn a temporary bridge.
As a precautionary measure, ten residences have been evacuated.
In Outaouais, the overflow of certain lakes has led to the closure of several roads, in particular in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
The Civil Security Unit is still on high alert and is monitoring the situation closely, security adviser Annik Bouchard said.
The Quebec Growth Prediction Center, for its part, issued announcements on Wednesday communicating the strong growths of several rivers, in particular the Maskinongé, the Assumption, the Ouareau, the Achigan, the Batiscan and the Loup.
Partially blamed on Dupont
Quebec radio host Stéphane Dupont has suffered a setback before the Canadian Radio-television Standards Council (CCNR) over controversial statements about social assistance and Haitians, as well as their rude language on the radio.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and his CHOI 98.1 FM team had the right to express their opinion, but certain statements contained “inaccurate information about social assistance, an unduly negative representation of Haitians and rude language that should not be used in broadcasts during the day.”
The Council has also indicated that discussions on suicide, including the disclosure of the names of two people who had committed suicide, do not violate the broadcasting codes.
The CCNR had received a number of complaints regarding comments made on broadcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was issued following a complaint by the Common Front of People receiving social assistance from Quebec.
The group complained that the amounts mentioned in the broadcast were not correct.
Presenters should communicate reliable data and not lead to deception.
In connection with the suicide, the defendant Stéphane Dupont had stated that the suicide was an act of cowardice.
Most members of the Committee have concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be regarded as a solution to the problems of life.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the disputed episodes of 'Dupont le midi' have dealt with a sensitive issue in an equitable and appropriate manner."
Therefore, any guilt in this regard has been dismissed.
The last dispute concerned the statements made after the earthquake in Haiti.
At that time, Stéphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort had starred in a media confrontation that had provoked numerous reactions.
The CHOI presenter stated that he had not made any donations to help the Haitians because he could not know for sure if the needy were really going to receive the money.
The Committee considers that these comments are not abusive, but that their cumulative effect constitutes an unduly negative representation of Haitians.
"I've already served my three-day suspension up there."
"My file has been clean for a year and a half," the presenter said.
In all decisions, the Committee denounces the issuance of rude language.
In any case, the radio station CHOI-FM has collaborated "even more than required".
The consequences will be minimal for the broadcaster, who must, among other things, announce the decisions once in the hours of the largest hearing within three days.
A King of Kung Fu in Montreal
The Algerian-born Montrealer Nacereddine Zemmal has had an extremely peculiar journey.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and Thai boxing, climbs the tatamis and rings of the world in search of new challenges.
“I started practicing martial arts like kung fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” said Zemmal, who has been living in the metropolis since 2008 to advance at the professional level.
“In my case, I look for fights everywhere because, for those who don’t enjoy the on-the-ground play involving mixed martial arts, there are few competitions in North America.”
The athlete, who works as a security agent and as an employee of the UPS company, has recently given bad news to his rivals, winning two gold medals at the World Amateur Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) World Championship, held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
“I have won in the categories of kickboxing full contact and Thai boxing,” he explained.
"I am currently preparing to participate in the World Cup of san shou in China."
"They will invite athletes who have finished in the top four positions in the last world championship in each category."
"In 2009, he won the bronze medal in Toronto".
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished in eighth place."
"In 2007, in China, I finished the tournament in fifth place, but I reached third place in Toronto in 2009," he added.
"The interesting thing is that I have progressed in every competition."
"At this step, I'll be the first this time or next year!"
"San shou" or "sanda" is a discipline originating in China in which it is allowed to hit with fists and feet, as well as throw opponents to the ground.
The fights are originally held on a platform and, less often, in a ring.
The most famous boxer in this type of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin Cung Le, widely recognized in the world of martial arts.
Although Nacer Zemmal should only maintain one competition in his career, he will undoubtedly attend the great tournament "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of kung-fu.
“This competition is the most famous and prestigious in China,” explains the friendly boy.
“It’s like the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium (Thailand’s largest stadium).”
“It has been an incredible experience.”
Zemmal has won his first fight, in the semifinals of his category (80 kg), but lost in the final.
“He who has won me is a true professional,” he says.
"There are four competitors per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg)."
"The winners of the semi-finals face off in the final of their category."
"Then the champions of each category face off to crown a single champion, the king of kung fu."
450 million in contracts without tenders
Hydro-Québec has awarded $450 million in direct contracts to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
At the center of this avalanche of more than a hundred contracts is a consortium formed by the companies BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor, which has obtained without a prior tender the most important contract, the project management contract, for a sum of 295 million.
The consortium, called <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance, was created in 2004 following Hydro-Québec’s decision to entrust the private sector with its responsibility to manage this important $5 billion hydroelectric project.
At the beginning of 2005, the consortium <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance obtained the lucrative contract without a public tender.
For the Quebec Party, the use of consortiums of companies poses a serious ethical problem that threatens to eliminate competition and provoke a rise in prices.
“This is a new method of collusion and elimination of competition.”
"In other words, people, instead of doing it in secret, are now doing it openly," Quebec Party MP Sylvain Simard told a news conference.
Earlier in the morning, Mr Simard raised the issue in the National Assembly because, he said, he did not understand how the public interest could be benefited in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, responded in the afternoon, firmly denying that there has been a collusion with this contract.
“I’m starting to get tired,” he protested, arguing that the PQ had acted in a “dishonest” and “lacking rigour.”
He noted that "the minimum" would be for the PQ to apologize.
The formula of consortia is a common practice throughout the world.
Typically, it is an alliance with a time limit that allows two or more companies to pool their knowledge to respond to a tender for a complex project.
The Eastmain project presents a high level of complexity, taking into account the scale of the works.
The works have already started and will last until 2012.
In all cases, the contract was awarded without competition being involved; it was a negotiation.
In addition, the consortium formula has ceased to be the exception to the standard in Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As Le Devoir published last week, the formula of consortia in the technical advice sector is being investigated by the government.
A quick look at Quebec’s trade register allows you to identify more than 200 consortia, some of which seem permanent.
In this way, Dessau works in partnership with most of its main competitors, such as CIMA+, Genivar, SNC-Lavalin, Roche et Tecsult, and others.
Each combination, and there are dozens of them, leads to a single legal entity, i.e. Dessau.
Concerning the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium, Minister Normandeau stressed that "the territory of James Bay responds to a particular labour dynamics and Hydro-Québec responds specifically to it since the 1970s".
The great head of the Eastmain project, Réal Laporte, of the Société d'énergie de la Baie James (SEBJ), has given an explanation that has highlighted the fact that the project management contract has been awarded directly.
“If you respond to a tender and there are few participants, your prices will be higher.”
"You have two options: you can get in touch with the players in the sector and tell them: we will negotiate a satisfactory agreement with a good price."
“However, the idea is that what matters is not the price, but the competition of the people,” said Mr. Laporte.
The contract awarded to the <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Quebec Party.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Québec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
Following the verification, Le Devoir has identified 109 technical advisory contracts awarded between 2002 and March 2010 to companies or their subsidiaries, in particular geotechnical laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin has obtained 22 contracts, Genivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account their participation in <0xC3><0x89>nergie gérance.
All contracts were negotiated.
In total, they amounted to $449,783,344, including the Energie gérance contract of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has hinted that the four companies that make up the consortium (BPR, Dessau, Groupe SM and Axor) are "well known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
Minister Normandeau has let it fall that the PQ is also linked to these companies, which "finance" it, before specifying that it is rather about its leaders.
Barometer of responsible consumption. The label "green" does not inspire confidence
More eco-friendly, but deeply skeptical.
The consumer in Quebec hardly trusts the actors of sustainable development, as well as fair trade brands or green certificates to guide their choices.
According to the Barometer of Responsible Consumption, whose first results were published yesterday, the situation is even worse. The consumer is immersed in a media universe where they pull messages that defend a more responsible consumption, but regrets the lack of reliable information and believes that this even slows down their commitment.
Even if consumption of so-called “socially responsible” products has increased in 2010, Quebecers seem to give very little credit to those who try to sell them.
Two-thirds of them say, in fact, that they do not trust the environmental commitment of companies or the advertising of environmentalists, reveals the measurement tool developed by the Observatory of Responsible Consumption of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of consumers question the reliability of the official certificates that carry the so-called fair products, as well as the credibility of the products and brands that carry labels indicating that they are "eco-responsible", says the Barometer.
Similarly, only 14.6% of Quebecers take politicians’ speeches on this issue seriously.
In any case, information on responsible consumption seems essential to stimulate this sector of consumption, currently supported by about a third of Quebec consumers.
In fact, gaps and the dubious nature of the information make 46% of consumers dismiss this option.
This is the second obstacle identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products.
In addition, a third of Quebecers say they are also suspicious of the supposed returns of ecological products or services they are trying to sell.
On the other hand, almost half of consumers changed their habits in 2010 and, especially, changed the brand of one or more products to respect their convictions.
61% have given priority to shopping in their neighborhood stores and have preferred to buy food grown in their region, says the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible (the Responsible Consumption Index has reached 64 points out of a maximum of one hundred this year), Quebec’s Homo consumus loves to take on the role of recycling king who tries to reduce his impact on the environment by worrying about wildlife protection.
However, according to the Barometer, that social awareness seems to be door-to-door (from their car) outside: in 2010, only 28% of Quebecers indicated that they have used public transport or have shared a car to defend their ecological principles.
In addition, 39.1% of participants in this comprehensive behavioural survey, which has just completed its first edition, support the use of bicycles and walking.
A loan for the state to recover eXcentris
The Government of Quebec, which has been asked to commit itself financially to the recovery of the eXcentris cinema complex after the Société Angus and the Parallele, agrees to collaborate, but only through a loan.
The Société de développement Angus and the Parallele, who were waiting for a $7 million donation from the Ministry of Culture to buy Daniel Langlois back the eXcentris film complex on Boulevard Saint-Laurent and return him to his true cinematic vocation, have not got what they were asking for.
The Government has agreed to be involved in the matter, but on its own terms.
Instead of the expected donation, the Government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would in fact be less than initial expectations; this could constitute a viable solution on advantageous terms, at least in the opinion of certain public employees.
Quebec had already rejected a first action plan and a 12.8 million request last spring, but since then the requests have been revised downwards.
The president of the Société de développement des entreprises culturelles (SODEC), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Macerola, who leads the eXcentris dossier, sent a proposal and an action plan to Minister St-Pierre.
He sent you one last report a dozen days ago.
However, SODEC received a counter-proposal from the cabinet on Tuesday.
The Parallele and Angus have a deadline of December 31 to respond to the same.
In any case, it seems that the hypothesis of a state donation should be completely discarded.
Recall that the Association of owners of cinemas and cinema complexes in Quebec opposed a direct investment by the state to support the recovery of eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, since it has not done so with other cinemas.
On the other hand, several representatives of the sector do call for considerable economic aid.
Daniel Langlois, the owner of the complex, has for ten years carried the burden of the cinema of authorship in its premises of the complex, after financing its own construction, which could justify a derogation by the Treasury Board.
The lack of rooms for independent films is evident in Montreal and eXcentris had managed to retain its clientele.
Angus and Parallel, led by Christian Yaccarini, are pushing for a private financing campaign, hoping to raise $700,000 to pave the way for the acquisition.
Since spring 2009, only one of these rooms, the Parallele, continues to screen films on eXcentris.
The goal of the future buyers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27, projecting Xavier Beauvois's beautiful film "Des hommes et des deux".
However, Christian Yaccarini has not contacted Le Devoir again and we do not know what he and his group think of the downward proposals they have received.
It lifts the veil of complex Canada...
The new U.S. diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks reveal what the U.S. considers to be the Canadian-American complex, but at the same time reflect the latter’s sense of superiority toward Canada.
U.S. diplomats are surprised that Canadian voters don’t think about Canada-U.S. relations when they go to vote and believe President Obama’s visit has helped the conservative government get its budget approved in 2009!
The four new communications between the U.S. Embassy in Ottawa and Washington that have been made public yesterday offer rather juicy details than really substantial content.
A cable from September 22, 2008, i.e., during the full federal election campaign, recounts the extent to which the United States does not enter into the issues debated by political leaders.
This caused great surprise to the American ambassador sent to Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr Wilkins offers some explanations of this situation.
“Perhaps political leaders are conditioned by an inferiority complex virtually inherent to Canadians when dealing with daily domestic issues, rather than leaving such an election to the United States (as during the 1988 free trade campaign),” he writes.
Therefore, he concludes, the United States is “the proverbial elephant of this choice: omnipresent, but potentially too dangerous to talk about.”
The ambassador has even more trouble understanding this " deafening silence" because the two countries maintain intense political and economic relations.
“Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, a party, and even more so of a party leader to manage these essential relationships should be a key factor that voters should think about when voting.”
This feeling of importance can also be seen in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, in charge of business in Ottawa, to prepare President Barack Obama for his first visit to Ottawa.
“His trip will help ensure the survival of the government during the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will for the first time record a deficit in the last decade due to a recovery plan of between $30 billion and $40 billion,” Breese wrote.
Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend Parliament before Christmas to prevent it from being replaced by the coalition or that opposition parties conditioned its survival on the quality of the proposed recovery plan.
Another January 2008 communication signed by Ambassador Wilkins alerted Washington to the increasingly negative image broadcast by the drama series broadcast on the U.S. CBC.
The ambassador is concerned about the issuance of Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which unsubtle references are made to Maher Arar, the “No-Fly-List” or even kidnappings for the CIA to conduct vigorous interrogations.
Another cable says that during her first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe would be willing to host some prisoners from Guantanamo.
Mr. Kouchner replied that yes, but that it depended "on every case."
At the end of the meeting, they wrote, "he has handed over a document to the Secretary of State regarding Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Muslim of Canadian origin."
"The Secretary agreed to review the file."
Finally, we can mention that the moods in relation to the WikiLeaks site have warmed.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, said on CBC radio that the person responsible for this mass escape should be “murdered.”
In the United States, Mike Huckabee is mentioned.
A Global Plan to Renew Lighting
Yesterday, the UN proposed in Cancun a plan to renew domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in one hundred countries to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) in an amount that corresponds to almost a third of the additional reduction that must be carried out to stabilize the climate of the planet before 2020.
This ambitious plan is part of the set of major concrete projects that the UN hopes will be adopted in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding commitments of reduction in industrialized countries.
According to the plan presented yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still monopolize between 50 and 70% of the market, are replaced by fluorescent bulbs or, even better, by light emitting diode (LED) bulbs, much of the 1.8 billion tons (Gt) of GHG emitted by humans would be avoided.
Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions.
It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary car park.
In Copenhagen last year, major emitting countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, committed to voluntary reduction plans that were to reduce global GHG emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, 5 Gt of that amount should still be decreased to stabilize, by 2020, the increase in temperatures by two degrees centigrade to prevent it from becoming out of control.
In incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and the rest, i.e. 5%, produces light.
In the case of compact fluorescent bulbs, energy consumption is reduced by 75% and with the new LED bulbs, energy consumption is further reduced by two times.
Fluocompact bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours.
The new LED bulbs, such as those launched by the manufacturer Philips this week (a company that has also participated in the UN study), have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than a incandescent bulb, allowing us to get an idea of the savings that can be achieved with the replacement plan that would apply in a hundred countries.
These new bulbs can also work with rheostats and emit very little heat.
They do not contain any mercury.
Several specialists have expressed reservations about fluorescent lamps, since they contain mercury and should be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless manufacturers provide instructions.
However, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet are not fluorescent bulbs, but coal-fired power plants, which emit a large amount of mercury to produce electricity that is wasted with incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury a year.
The report details the advantages this international programme would offer to each country.
For example, Indonesia would thus save $1 billion a year in electricity and eight million tons of CO2, that is, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost it 2.5 billion.
C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire looks forward to the announcement of the election results
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has called for the "immediate" publication of the results of the presidential elections in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire, as the deadlines have expired.
“The Secretary-General highlights the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and announce the provisional results immediately,” a UN spokesman said.
“Call on all parties in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire and institutions to demonstrate their sense of responsibility and refrain from any initiative until the provisional results are announced.”
Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has allowed the deadline from Wednesday to midnight to pass without the results being published, three days after Sunday’s scrutiny.
About forty minutes before the deadline ended, the CIS president had commented on television that the commission was "still working" to announce the results.
On Wednesday, calls for the CIS to finally proclaim the name of the winner of the second round between outgoing Laurent Gbagbo and his opponent Alassane Ouattara have multiplied in the world.
However, Gbagbo's side has had the Constitutional Council annulling the "fraudulent" votes in the north, in the hands of the former rebellion of the New Forces (FN) since the failed coup d'état in September 2002.
Pascal Affi N’Guessan, director of the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d’Ivoire’s president’s campaign, has said that the U.N.’s intimidation of voters in the north of the country had deterred supporters of the outgoing president from going to vote.
The entire election could be annulled if the Constitutional Council accepts Gbagbo’s complaints.
However, Gbagbo's opponents consider the country's highest court not neutral, as it is headed by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who denies any relationship with the former rebels, has deemed the delay in publishing the results “unacceptable” and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to claim victory.
His allies claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows he has lost and that filing a complaint with the Constitutional Council after having prevented the election commission from disseminating the results would be illegal.
The second round of the presidential elections, on Sunday, should have set the stage for the process of reunification and reconciliation of a country divided in two for years.
The United Nations warned the political class in C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Ivoire on Wednesday that they could be held responsible for possible acts of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo had finished in the first round, on October 31, with 38% of the vote against 32% of Alassane Ouattara, who publicly received the support of former President Henri Konan Bédié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate remains stable in France in the third quarter
According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), the unemployment rate in France has remained stable at 9.3% on the mainland (9.7% taking into account overseas departments), as indicated by the data corrected with the provisional seasonal variations (CVE) published by Insee on Thursday.
The number of unemployed remains at 2,631,000 in mainland France.
The data for the second quarter have been confirmed, 9.3% of the working population in the mainland and 9.7% with the DOMs.
In one year, the unemployment rate has registered an increase of 0.1 points.
Overall, 3.4 million people in metropolitan France were not working in the third quarter, but they want to work, whether or not they are available within two weeks to work and whether or not they are looking for employment.
The situation of young people in the labour market has continued to worsen, with a further increase in the unemployment rate to 24.2% in mainland France (+0.9 points in three months, +0.5 points in one year), 25% including the DOMs.
During the third quarter, 637,000 young people between the ages of 15 and 24 were unemployed in the sense of the ILO.
For its part, there has been a slight increase in unemployment among older people, up to 6.4% in mainland France (+0.2 points both in three months and in one year), that is, 482,000 people over 50 years old, a figure that amounts to 6.6% with the DOMs.
There has only been a stability of unemployment among people aged between 25 and 49 years, with 8.3% in mainland France (-0.1 points in three months, +0.1 points in one year) and 8.8% throughout France.
Since 2006, Insee has not published the monthly unemployment rate, after a controversy over its calculation methods.
Eurostat, the European Union's statistical agency, continues to do so and announced on Tuesday a 9.8% rate for France (including DOM) in October, after a 9.9% rate in September.
Alexandre Guérini investigated and detained
Alexandre Guerini, 53, director of waste treatment companies and brother of the PS president of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne, is being investigated and has been imprisoned in the prison of Luynes, near Aix-en-Provence, as part of an investigation into allegedly fraudulent public contracts.
Alexandre Guérini is being investigated for social abuse, embezzlement of funds and public goods, cover-up, active corruption, trafficking in influence and possession of ammunition, according to his lawyer.
"Alexandre Guérini is going to fight and will answer all the questions that the magistrate asks him, not ghosts."
"It is easy to prosecute him for a multitude of reprehensible acts, it is another thing to prove them," his lawyer, Florence Rault, told AFP before his client's appearance.
Mr. Guérini, brother of the PS leader in the department, Jean-No<0xC3><0xAB>l Guérini, has wanted to transmit, through his lawyers, to the judge, before his appearance, a document to explain himself.
On Wednesday night they began investigating and also imprisoned one of their close people, Philippe Rapezzi.
According to his lawyer, Mr. Lucien Simon, the only thing his client has done has been to take care of the landfills he has to manage.
As for the allocation of contracts or the destination of funds related to their execution, he knows nothing about it, according to lawyer Simon.
In the context of this case, Daniel Pinna, former director general of the services of the urban agglomeration of Aubagne, is also being investigated since Wednesday for embezzlement of funds and complicity, but has been released on probation and is forbidden to meet with the protagonists of the case.
"My client has been able to explain all the facts that have reproached him."
"The investigating magistrate has taken into account the explanations and has released him," his lawyer, Mr. Yann Arnoux, said.
On the night of Tuesday to Wednesday, four other people were interrogated and released, under judicial control in the case of two of them, according to the Deputy Prosecutor of the Republic, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, deputy director general of the Marseille Provence Métropole (MPM) property, has been charged with “trafficking in influence and passive corruption.”
Two officials from the Aubagne agglomeration, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Duval and Christophe Bringuier, have been interrogated for "collection and embezzlement of public goods by a person dedicated to public service" and for "complicity in embezzlement of public funds", respectively.
Finally, Alexandre Guérini’s partner, Jeannie Peretti, is being investigated for “cover-up of the abuse of social goods.”
Among those who have faced Mr. Guerini is Stéphane Brunengo-Girard, who was recently imprisoned in a parallel case of fraudulent public contracts affecting Corsica.
Researchers suspect that their societies have a service to whitewash the capital of big banditry.
The investigation is being carried out in the context of several court orders initiated against X in April 2009 following the receipt of anonymous communications, of course fraud in the allocation of public contracts, in particular in the waste sector.
A source close to the research points out that the research focuses especially on the conditions of allocation and operation of a landfill in La Ciotat, which collects the waste from Aubagne, as well as from other cities in the urban community of Marseille (MPM).
Clotilde Reiss: the Elysée has exaggerated the mediation of Syria
For more than ten months, between July 2009 and May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher detained in Iran for “espionage”, has been on the public’s lips in France, has alerted diplomacy and has accentuated the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran.
All under the watchful eye of U.S. diplomats.
U.S. documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain unknown aspects of this crisis.
They describe how the Elysee has explained its strategy to Americans to the point of giving them advice to manage their own “hostage” crises in Iran (a small group of walkers).
They show how French officials tried to convince Washington that the release of the French girl did not occur in exchange for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by U.S. justice for material trafficking for the Iranian nuclear program.
Finally, they reveal the stark reality of how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give the idea that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad had played an essential role in the liberation of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, he didn't do anything.
A diplomatic telegram written on 12 August 2009 in Paris bears the title "Iran: French comments on how to manage hostage-taking cases".
The Elysee’s strategic affairs adviser, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier, accompanied by the Quai d’Orsay director for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, talks with U.S. diplomat Kathleen Allegrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise Americans to do the following to repatriate their own citizens forcibly detained in Iran.
"Make noise," they say, "release continuously" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release."
All to shame the Iranian regime, careful of its image.
“When the Iranians ask you to stop, do it more often.”
Because, once the attempts to negotiate through discrete channels are exhausted, “silence will solve nothing,” the Iranians are “experts in delaying maneuvers.”
Mr. Richier adds that the detention of foreigners is “a common Iranian tactic: taking hostages for political blackmail.”
He announces that the release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on August 16, the day he will take refuge at the French embassy) "will require the Iranians to pay a large amount of money" (230,000 euros reward).
In addition, he points out that Elisha anticipates other hostage crises, a phenomenon that “will increase.”
The Iranians could “in the near future stop another of the nearly 1,800 French citizens living in Iran,” he says.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss is released from prison after twelve days, but is blocked in Iran.
The following information is disseminated: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition is requested by the United States for illicit trafficking of sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been released in Paris by a judge’s decision.
The U.S. Embassy, as well as numerous observers, doubt this strange coincidence.
For Washington, which is close to Iran’s underground nuclear procurement networks, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
Has France accepted an exchange?
Free the Iranian in exchange for the French?
During a new conversation with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier guarantees that this was not the case.
The Elisha, he says, not only “has been greatly surprised by the judge’s decision,” but has tried to oppose it.
"There have been intense negotiations between the French presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot annul the decision" judicially, comments.
Mr. Richier also wants to show that Majid Kakavand remains under the “close” surveillance of the French intelligence services.
The Elysian adviser dials a phone number, hangs up, and then informs the U.S. diplomat that the Iranian “is currently in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy.”
During the arrest of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée does not spare in efforts, uses communiqués and "flights" organized in the media to make it believe that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad plays an "important" and "influential" role of "mediator".
Americans observe this activity with some irony and check that the manipulation brings its fruits, since several press articles transmit the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions "the media 'blitz' of French officials".
What is the reason for such "gratitude" towards Mr. Assad, the embassy in Paris asks.
“Despite their praiseworthy statements, French officials privately acknowledge that they only have a vague idea of what the Syrians have really done.”
Next, the paper discusses the reasons that have led the Elysée to give rise to this fiction.
The great communication effort "is aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of openness towards Syria," he said.
A policy initiated in 2008, which "in the opinion of numerous critical voices in France and abroad, had just been flagged as premature and undeserved".
By “exaggerating the Syrian role,” Paris is trying to “show Syria the praise it can reap if it plays a constructive role in the region.”
The goal is also to “sow the seed of discord between Syria and Iran.”
The U.S. Embassy knows this from a good source.
On August 11, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Richier confided to him: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done anything or not."
"But anyway, we've thanked him."
"At least, this should cause confusion among the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16, 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy welcomes her to the Elysée.
In a statement, he thanked the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for having played an "active role in favor of the liberation of our compatriot".
From midnight, young Koreans can not play online
The South Korean government is going to pass a law called Cinderella that will prevent teens from participating in online games after midnight by blocking their access, government officials have said.
In December, a bill will be submitted to Parliament to ask online gaming companies to block access to such games after midnight to young people under the age of 16, according to representatives of the Ministries of Culture and Family.
“Many children play all night and then find it difficult to study at school and lead a normal life during the day.”
“We think this law is necessary to protect your health and your right to sleep,” said Jo Rin, the minister responsible for the bill.
Online games will be available again at six in the morning.
Companies will have one year to prepare for law enforcement, he said.
The government also plans to ask companies to limit daily access to these games when parents of young people so request, the official added.
In addition, it will make available to those who request it free computer programs that allow you to limit the time of connection to the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most “connected” countries and newspapers regularly report on various facts linked to intensive Internet use.
The country is also the undisputed champion of global online gaming competitions.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at the World Cyber Games, where it faced 58 other countries.
World Cup 2018-2022: FIFA appoints host countries
Amid the storm caused by suspicions of corruption, the FIFA executive committee on Thursday designated the host countries of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, a clearly political choice where influence struggles and lobbying can come to prevail over technical criteria.
One thing is clear, the 2018 edition of the FIFA competition will be held in Europe, the traditional bastion of the discipline (four candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and the Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 edition will be much more exotic, as the International Federation hopes to conquer new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a premiere on the African continent in 2010, or to continue its deployment in the United States or in the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of personalities who were part of the delegations (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, José Socrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Belgian and Dutch heads of government, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) attests to the economic and political interests at stake in a World Cup.
Behind-the-scenes transactions, therefore, may last until the last minute.
For the rest, it is difficult to establish a hierarchy among the candidates.
According to the FIFA evaluation report, the English, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) bids have better arguments than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not have too much weight for the 22 members of the executive committee when it comes to voting.
The Sunday Times, responsible for the revelations that led to the suspension for corruption of two EC members (Reynald Temarii and Amos Adamu), could have ruined the chances of their country, the cradle of football, which only hosted the World Cup once, in 1966.
The BBC added firewood to the fire on Monday by broadcasting a documentary that has exposed three influential EC members, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Enough to disgust FIFA and embarrass the British officials, who have launched intense lobbying in recent weeks with David Cameron at the helm.
The Head of Government looks forward to reiterating the successful coup by his predecessor, Tony Blair, which had secured the organisation of the 2012 JJ.OO for London in 2005.
This intense activity, will it be enough to regain the shine of England before the CE?
It is not clear, since the Spain-Portugal duo also has numerous strengths thanks to their stadiums, ready, their experience (World Cup of 82 in Spain, JJ.OO in Barcelona in 1992, European Cup in 2004 in Portugal) and their football culture.
However, the bleak economic and financial prospects of both countries could undercut their ambitions.
The possible reprisals against the English and the doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal all they get is to give points to Russia, turned into a weighty outsider despite the gaps in their candidacy (stadiums, hotels, transport).
However, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has decided not to travel to Zurich and has denounced an "unfair competence in the preparation of the vote", in a direct allusion to the accusations of the English press against the members of the EC.
“They are bringing out their dirty rags, trying to compromise them,” Putin said.
By 2022, the United States, which has the experience of 1994, seems to be the most logical favorites.
As the world’s first economic powerhouse and home to FIFA’s top sponsors, the country appears to be taking advantage of Japan and South Korea, which have separately developed an excellent project.
However, these new bids seem premature for two countries that have jointly organised the championship in 2002.
Another risk: the award of the 2026 World Cup to China, fervently desired by FIFA, which would cause Asia to run out of chances by 2022.
Along with Qatar, which has presented its project based on futuristic stadiums, and Australia, FIFA would continue its expansion into new horizons, but both countries present more risks than certainties.
Australia, like Japan and Korea, could also be hurt by the weakness of TV rights paid (depending on the time difference) by European countries, the backbone of the war for FIFA.
Second term: the test
De Gaulle had doubted.
Mitterand had hinted that he was in doubt.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had not the slightest doubt.
And Nicolas Sarkozy even less.
One mandate in the Elisha leads to another.
Therefore, the current head of state will again be a candidate in 2012.
However, the evidence does not match well with the mystery that is usually associated with the presidential function.
Therefore, it must always appear that it is doubtful.
To one side and to the other.
In 2006, although they did not believe it, Jacques Chirac's friends claimed that he did not rule out a third term.
On November 15, in a serious tone, Nicolas Sarkozy indicated that he would make his decision "at some point in the fall of 2011".
Therefore, the fact that he is dealing with MPs on Tuesday night in the Elysee, the possibility of "two mandates" has caused some revulsion.
Is this the official announcement of your candidacy?
Not much less.
The president only indicated that the 2008 constitutional reform limited the number of five-year terms to two.
It simply conveyed the facts, not an announcement.
This is not the first time he has spoken about the presidential elections, with a playful tone, in meetings of this kind.
“At worst, or better yet, you’ll still spend seven and a half years with me,” he had released in July 2009.
On another occasion, in May 2010: "Don't think that I don't think about what will come next."
His statements yesterday do not bring him any closer to the candidacy, nor any less.
They make comments for two reasons.
The acceleration of the race for the candidacy in the PS, on the one hand.
But it is not the fact that Ségol<0xC3><0xA8>ne Royal has taken the floor that leads Nicolas Sarkozy to be sincere.
Quite the contrary; the fact that his candidacy in 2012 is evident is what leads many PS people to demand that the battle be organized sooner than planned.
On the other hand, bad polls.
For the first time, right-wing voters prefer Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon’s candidacy to Nicolas Sarkozy’s (46% versus 44%, according to BVA-L’Express).
"We have a candidate and in the UMP there is no discussion on the issue," the environment of the Prime Minister has reacted immediately and prudently.
“If he thinks he can lose, he won’t be a candidate,” said Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
“You’ll always think you can win,” Alain Juppé corrected, resigned to the evidence.
Euro: the ECB is obliged to maintain its State Letter acquisitions
The last meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) of the year should allow to specify the ways out of the crisis or at least to announce the interruption of a large number of unconventional monetary policy operations that should end at the end of the year.
Because of the European sovereign debt crisis, the Frankfurt-based issuing agency will certainly not be able to afford to be so perennial if it does not want to risk aggravating a more than complicated situation today in European bond markets.
The political cost would be equally high.
Yesterday, during a press conference, the French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde, supported the active role played by the ECB in helping to resolve the debt crisis in European states.
He did not say whether he considered that the central bank should do more, for example by increasing its program of buying state bonds.
“I reserve my opinion for my fellow Europeans.”
The previous evening, in Brussels, during his hearing before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, did not show himself more eloquent about his intentions, indicating only that the program of buying State Letters in the secondary market "continued" and that "we will see what we decided" during the meeting.
The only thing that remains clear is that the ECB will keep its main rate unchanged at 1%, the lowest level in its history since May 2009.
In practice, the ECB’s acquisition of Treasury bonds has doubled last week to close to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.35 billion.
In addition, according to the indiscreet operators of the market, yesterday I would have bought again Irish and Portuguese securities.
In total, the Eurosystem’s central banks have acquired securities worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>67 billion since May 2010.
Among market operators, there is little doubt that purchases will follow (see page 29).
Economists also do not foresee any significant changes in direction.
Although more than three months of loan operations have already disappeared from the ECB’s arsenal, the ECB still makes unlimited allocations of liquidity on favourable terms and with durations ranging from one week to three months.
Economists expect this device to be extended for a few months today.
"I don't think he's going to significantly change his program."
“If not, I would run the risk of provoking new tensions in the short term,” said Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank.
“It seems more likely that there will be a progressive exit announced during the first quarter of 2011,” predicts Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms, an economist at Sal.
Oppenheim.
In relation to interventions in the public debt market, “the ECB should maintain a purchasing volume of these obligations in order for the market to remain stable,” adds Norbert Br<0xC3><0xA4>ms.
Given the importance of exposures by European banks to sovereign debt markets in the euro area, the issuing institution has no choice but to maintain its presence in the market.
"It must compensate at any price for the lack of investors in the market and act in such a way as to prevent a marked rise in the yields paid by the most fragile states," said a major bond manager.
Because, if interest rates are clouded, states will have even more trouble reducing their debt, or even stabilizing it.
This is the price of protecting the euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government capes the storm
After Italy started the week in a worrying way, the situation improved slightly yesterday with the reflow of 10-year bond rates.
A recovery from precarious calm.
At the start of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the regional presidents have stated that they heard Giulio Tremonti describe the situation as "indecipherable" and that a "unpredictable" weekend was expected, statements later denied by the interested party.
In any case, on Tuesday the difference with the long-term German rates had reached the record figure of 210 basis points and the price of insurance contracts against the risk of bankruptcy (CRQ) had skyrocketed to 263 points, causing a stir in Rome.
At the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi commented that, in Spain, the difference with the German rates was more than 400 basis points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, was "deeply concerned" by "market turbulence" and a possible contagion from Ireland.
“The good news is that Italy, the euro zone’s third-largest economy, is not like Greece or Ireland.”
“The bad news is that it’s like Portugal,” explains Irwin Stelzer, an economist at the Hudson Institute.
In reality, its problem is the lack of growth and the stagnation of income associated with it, which causes the State to run the risk of not being able to cope with its financing needs.
Brussels’ latest forecasts have meant a cold water jug for the government.
It is estimated that Italian growth will reach 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012, while the budget being examined in the Senate is based on figures of 1.3% and 2%, respectively.
Under these conditions, according to the European Commission, the public deficit will represent 4.3% of GDP next year (compared to 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of 2.7%).
Hence the rumor that new budgetary provisions can be applied after the holidays, for an amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, further austerity measures will have to be taken," said Economic Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn.
At the moment, Italy has the support of international institutions.
“The foundations of its economy are in order and its accounts are in good condition, as we have been saying for a long time,” said Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator at the International Monetary Fund responsible for Italy at the IMF.
“There is no immediate, short-term or long-term problem, because despite its considerable debt (119.2% of GDP in 2011, NDLR), the stabilization efforts requested from Italy are less than those required from other countries,” said Pier Carlo Padoan, OECD chief economist.
The problem of political instability remains.
On December 14, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, after which the elections could be anticipated at the end of March.
In such a case, a period of unfavourable decision-making would be opened in the event of a serious crisis.
Europeans reflect on strengthening anti-crisis mechanisms
Christine Lagarde has already repeated it yesterday during a press conference in Paris: "I think we have already demonstrated on Sunday, at night and by day, that Europeans are clearly supportive, determined, committed to the defense of their currency and their monetary zone."
Although it was relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday in the types of obligations of European states has boosted governments and the ECB.
However, we cannot yet talk about a principle of normalization.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's announced that it could lower Portugal's debt rating, the most frequent target at the moment of speculation.
“As in May, there is a real lack of political clarity and transparency, which weighs significantly on banking systems,” say economists at Exane BNP Paribas.
Especially because “the political pace is much slower than the pace of the markets.”
Aware of this hiatus and the dangers it hides, European countries are intensifying discussions to strengthen existing crisis exit mechanisms.
Informal consultations between finance ministers who are most directly affected and, in general, with their G-20 counterparts are on track.
And this also taking into account the Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings at the beginning of next week.
The ECB meets today.
On the agenda, the type of unconventional measures to support euro area countries in the market collimator (see above).
As for the European Financial Stability Fund (EFSF), its chief executive, Klaus Regling, began a tour of Asia in Singapore on Tuesday to inform investors in the Far East about the novelties of the crisis in Europe.
Although the purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, it certainly prepares the ground.
The first issues of EFSF bonds are expected to take place next month.
Yesterday, a US official told Reuters that the United States would support a potential increase in the funds mobilized through an additional direct commitment from the IMF.
As for the countries on the front lines, Portugal and Spain, they are preparing for structural reforms, in particular in relation to the organisation of the labour market.
These reforms add to austerity measures with a closer effect.
Lisbon and Madrid want to move on a different path than Greece and Ireland followed.
Both want to avoid asking for international aid at all costs before implementing their own budgetary corrections and deciding on the structural reforms they consider essential to build lasting confidence.
The capitalist partners of the European funds, finally, consider the options available to accelerate the process of normalization of the public bond markets.
Passing through Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber was the first to launch the idea that, if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund were not enough, the Union would not hesitate to pull out the wallet again.
Economists at Barclays Capital, a leading player in the European public debt market, believe that an amount of around an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion would be sufficient, “preferably” in the form of a direct injection of liquidity.
There is an instrument for this: the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently endowed with <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion.
It is a piece of advice that could certainly be examined in detail in European capitals.
Especially if the market conditions get worse.
Snow and ice: 24 departments on orange alert
Snowfall continues to cause traffic difficulties, especially in the secondary network in Brittany, and can affect various economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are currently on orange alert due to the risk of snowfall and ice formation.
Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux-S<0xC3><0xA8>vres and Vienne have joined the twenty departments already on orange alert, eighteen from Wednesday to noon and two, Dordogne and Gironde, joined the group at night.
According to Météo France, heavy snowfalls affect the north of Gironde and Charentes, although it also snows slightly on the island of France.
Snow layers between 2 and 5 cm, punctually between 7 and 10 cm, are expected in the affected departments, and between 1 and 3 cm, or even up to 5 cm, in the Paris region.
The departments affected are Charente, Charente-Maritime, C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the regions of Lower Normandy, Island of France and Lemosin.
The snowfalls are strong enough to cause traffic difficulties and affect some economic activities, warns Météo France.
In the C<0xC3><0xB4>tes d'Armor, access to several departmental roads has been prohibited to heavy vehicles of more than 7.5 tonnes, including the Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Brieuc-Loudéac axes.
According to the gendarmes, the circulation in the secondary network of Brittany is complicated, so they recommend not to drive except in case of need and the circulation of certain TER vehicles during the day has been prohibited.
On Thursday, school transport was banned in Picardy.
No specific measures were planned on Wednesday night to limit the movement of heavy vehicles.
The prefecture “urges all drivers to drive with the utmost caution on the roads and to adapt their driving to the situation.”
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) asked airlines to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights at the Paris airport of Roissy and 10% in Orly due to the planned snowfall.
The DGAC advises air passengers to contact their airline.
In Britain, Gatwick Airport, south of London, and Edinburgh Airport, Scotland, are closed until Thursday morning.
Metro del Grand Paris: first financial drafts
Since the debate on the modernization of transport on the island of France has reached its peak, billions have been raining.
At least in the debate.
In particular, we are talking about the 23 billion for the metro of the Grand Paris that should be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
To start this SGP, the state has announced an allocation of funds of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>4 billion.
Theoretically, this amount will be the amount that will subsequently allow the SGP to obtain loans in the markets to finance a part of its double loop.
Today, at last, we have the first accounts.
The 2010 Amending Finance Act, which was reviewed by the National Assembly Finance Commission this morning, contains the devices planned to find the first part of that money.
There are two ways: the creation of a special equipment tax and the increase in the tax on offices on the Island of France.
The first, as we read in article 15 of the text of the bill, is "for the benefit of the public institution Société du Grand Paris".
In addition, it is fixed in numbers: "The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year."
The second is a modification of a tax on offices that already exists "to modernize it, increase its product and allocate this increase to the Société du Grand Paris".
How much would you get with this method?
Who knows.
There are no figures in the text.
But it's far from four billion.
"It is necessary that the tax resources are added to the 4 billion euros of the allocation of funds that will mobilize the state and that will be granted to the Société du Grand Paris as the project progresses," we can read in the explanatory statement.
The SGP is not surprised by this system.
“From the moment revenue is created (both taxes, NDLR), we can cover the studies for three years and then receive the $4 billion later, as we explained.”
"It will be registered in the budget and used according to needs."
The GSP estimates that it will start receiving the $4 billion in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This arrangement, in which the four billion pledges are not included in the credit, can provoke a slightly heated parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be on December 7.
Avenging hackers and diligent spies
The WikiLeaks issue has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals an apparent scandal, a scandal that only seems to be a scandal in the face of the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press.
On the other hand, it heralds profound changes on an international scale and foresees a future dominated by regression.
But let's go step by step.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that every file created by a secret service (regardless of the nation to which it belongs) is exclusively made up of press clippings.
The "extraordinary" American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only reflect what has been written for months in any newspaper (except those belonging to Berlusconi) and the sinisterly ridiculous profile of Gaddafi has long been giving cabaret artists ideas to create their sketches.
The rule that secret files should only be made up of news of public knowledge is essential to the dynamics of secret services, and not only in this century.
If you visit a library dedicated to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (about the Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly what had been written in the previous works.
This is not only because the authors of occult texts do not want to do unpublished research (or do not know where to look for novelties about the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to occultism not only trust what they already know, which reconfirms what they had already learned.
This is the mechanism of Dan Brown’s success.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy, as is the head of the secret services (if he could not be, I know, editor of the Libération), who only considers what he can recognize to be true.
The top secret information about Berlusconi that the U.S. Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department was the same that Newsweek published the previous week.
So why have the revelations of these files caused such a stir?
On the one hand, they only say what every cultivated person already knows, that is, that the embassies, at least since World War II and since the Heads of State can call on the phone or take the plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic function and, with the exception of some limited representation exercises, have become centers of espionage.
Any viewer who watches investigative films knows it perfectly, we just seem not to know it by hypocrisy.
In any case, repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy and gives a bad image of U.S. diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can consult the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world significantly affects the prestige of the State Department.
Therefore, the scandal affects both the victims and the "victims".
But let us enter into the true nature of what has happened.
In ancient times, in the time of Orwell, one could conceive of all power as a Big Brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects.
Orwell’s prophecy has come true since, being able to control every move thanks to the telephone, every transaction made, hotel visited, highway taken, the citizen thus became a complete victim of the eye of power.
But when it is shown, as it is now, that not even the crypts of the secrets of power can escape the control of a hacker, the control relationship ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular.
Power controls every citizen, but every citizen (at least the hacker, chosen as the citizen’s avenger) can know all the secrets of power.
How can one endure a power that can no longer even keep its own secrets?
It is true, as Georg Simmel said, that a true secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be revealed); it is also true that all knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, without a secret, since it comes from the public sphere; but to reveal, as WikiLeaks has done, that all the secrets of Hillary are to be revealed.
WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy or Merkel, but yes, and a lot, to Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this wound caused to such a powerful power?
It is clear that, in the future, States will no longer be able to put any reserved information on the network, since it would be like publishing it on a poster in the street.
But it’s also clear that, with current technologies, you can’t expect to keep confidential conversations over the phone.
Nothing is easier than to find out if and when a Head of State has travelled by plane and contacted one of the counterparts.
How will they be able to maintain private and confidential relationships in the future?
I know perfectly well that, for the moment, my prediction is something of science fiction and therefore novel, but I imagine government agents moving discreetly in diligences with uncontrollable itineraries, carrying messages that have been learned from memory or, at most, hiding some data written on the heels of their shoes.
That information is then kept, in a single copy, in locked drawers: in the end, the Watergate spying attempt was less successful than WikiLeaks.
In the past, I have written that technology is currently advancing like a crab, that is, backwards.
A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has re-created a telegraph with cables (telephones).
Video (analog) tapes had allowed film researchers to study a film step by step, moving forward and backward, discovering all the secrets of editing, while now (digital) CDs only allow you to move forward or backward from chapter to chapter, i.e., to enormous proportions.
With high-speed trains, we can go from Rome to Milan in three hours, while by plane, with the journeys it entails, we need three and a half hours.
Therefore, it is nothing out of the ordinary that politics and communication techniques take us back to horse-drawn cars.
One last comment.
In the old days, the press was trying to understand what was going on in secret at the embassies.
At present, it is the embassies that ask for confidential information from the press.
Climate: France’s slugs in its funding pledges
A year after the Copenhagen Accord, it is time to examine whether the fast-started or early-start financing promises made by developed countries have been met.
And the French slippers have been unveiled.
In the Copenhagen Agreement, developed countries committed to providing $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union committed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion in three years and France <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.26 billion (i.e. <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>420 million per year).
During the opening of COP16, the EU has put on the table its best letters to convince its partners that its commitment to fast start financing is true: a report detailing the measures of its Member States, a press conference, a major supplementary event, the distribution of brochures...
The transparency operation was appreciable and appreciated for what it really is: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do the same and with the same level of precision.
The EU announces that it has released <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion in 2010, putting it on track to deliver on its <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>7.2 billion commitment in 2012.
But, if we study the situation in detail, things are more complicated.
Under the Copenhagen Agreement, money must be “new and additional” to ensure that a complementary effort is made, without prejudicing official development assistance.
Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached on what "new and additional" means.
When the European Commission proposed harmonisation, some Member States, including France, blocked the procedure.
Nowadays, everyone chooses the reference that suits them best.
For example, the European Commission has taken the year 2009 as a reference: international funding is maintained and 150 million are added in three years as fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar benchmarks in terms of year or level of official development assistance.
On the contrary, France considers that the financing of "all new projects" of 2010 is "new and additional".
In other words, no reference is made to the expenditure of previous years or to the total level of official development assistance.
In particular, the total amount of France’s aid to developing countries may remain stable (or even diminish), while it seeks to respect its commitment to “new and additional” funds.
Another crucial element, the distribution between donations and loans.
Again, there is no standard and everyone chooses the method of calculation.
Some, such as France, consider that each euro borrowed is equivalent to one euro donated.
Obviously, such a thing is difficult to justify: the effort is not comparable.
Although the use of loans may be justified for certain investments that are profitable (often projects related to the reduction of emissions that are based on more effective technologies), it is fallacious to present a euro that will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that is donated... As much, one should only calculate for their commitments the cost of the loan for the country that lends (the equivalent of interest).
But France does not find such reasoning useful: "respect" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of donations (36.1 million euros); see the EU document to see it for yourself.
It is the only country in the Union that uses the loan so frequently.
Germany uses it by 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia, among others, respect their commitments with 100% donations.
In other words, when the majority of the European Union contributes one euro to meet its commitment, France only contributes ten cents and considers the effort to be comparable.
A good trick!
In short, in its fast start financing, France commits a double abuse: on the one hand, in relation to the actions over time and, on the other, in relation to the real financial effort.
Spending just 36.1 million euros, he manages to give the impression that he spends 420 million "new and additional", as he had promised.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (because it seems that it is Bercy who has dealt with the arbitration) could have a double negative impact, both within the EU (why would the other Member States continue to donate when they can simply lend?) and in the negotiations, since developing countries are not fools...
The early funding chapter is a relatively short-term detail in relation to the climate negotiations as a whole.
But it could be a grain of sand too much in the immense machinery that is the UNFCCC.
Let's hope it doesn't.
Whatever it is, it is essential to learn from this first year of early funding.
Firstly, France could announce a change in its calculation method for 2011 and 2012, with the intention of respecting its commitments and in the same way as the other countries of the European Union.
But, in particular, France could advance the debate on gambling in relation to long-term financing (another essential chapter that is currently under discussion): we will not get rid of the question of the "additional character" or the method of calculating loans.
France could change its stance to become as progressive on this issue as it is with others.
We therefore have the hope of the new Minister of the Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Cancun next week.
A surprise announcement about France's fast start and its vision of "additional character" and the use of loans would help improve the level of international confidence needed to move forward in negotiations.
Warning about pesticides ingested by children
A 10-year-old boy ingests 81 different chemicals in a day, according to a study published Wednesday by the Générations Futures association (the former movement for the rights and respect of future generations).
The association, which warns that its results "have no significant statistical value considering the limited number of samples analyzed, but are illustrative of the problem treated," acquired in supermarkets in Oise and Paris between July and September the foods that a child of about ten years old usually consumes in four meals and one snack a day.
These model meals, which respect official recommendations (five parts of fresh fruits and vegetables, three of dairy products and 1.5 liters of water per day), as well as the sweets, were examined in laboratories for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other contaminants.
The plate balance is overwhelming: 81 chemicals, of which 42 are classified as possible or probable carcinogens and five are classified as safe carcinogens, as well as 37 substances likely to act as endocrine disruptors (EDs), according to studies from various institutions such as the International Center for Cancer Research.
“Although, in virtually all cases, the legal limits for each of the chemicals are not exceeded individually, our study clearly shows that consumer exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminants and/or PE is of concern,” the association notes.
For breakfast, butter and milk tea alone contain more than a dozen possible carcinogens and three considered safe carcinogens, as well as about twenty residues that can harm the hormonal system.
The apple, imported from Brazil, intended as a snack for the school, contains traces of six chemicals, including a fungicide banned in France.
The same applies to Kenya’s green beans, including in food, where the study has detected traces of a potent insecticide banned in the EU.
In addition, Russian steak, canned tuna, and even bread bar or gum were adhered to with pesticides and other chemicals.
In tap water, analyses discovered the presence of nitrates and chloroform.
At dinner, the salmon slice was the most "nutritive" with 34 chemical residues detected and even the analysis of the plastic dish used to heat the food in the microwave was not completely clean.
The ultimate risk these “contaminant cocktails” generate to the consumer is “probably underestimated,” the study says.
The Alliance Europe Ecology-Les Verts (EE-LV), for its part, has proposed "against the gravity of the situation" to apply a moratorium on the use of pesticides to curb "the increase in diseases associated with civilization".
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) indicated the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides identified in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, of which 76 in cereals.
