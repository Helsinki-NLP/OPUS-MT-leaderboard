Members of the Welsh National Assembly fear they will be called muppets
Some members of the National Assembly have been appalled by the proposal to change their title to Member of the Welsh Parliament (MWP).
The idea arose in connection with the plans to transform the Assembly into the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly from all sides of the political scene are concerned that they may become the subject of ridicule.
One Labour MP voiced concerns about his grouping, saying the new name rhymes with the Welsh words “twp” and “pwp”.
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh the word “twp” means stupid, and the word “pwp” means waste.
One of Plaid Cymru's politicians said his group was "unsatisfied" with the proposal and presented other solutions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his party was "open" to changing its name, but noted that the word "MWP" was very similar to the word "muppet".
In this case, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in the English Yorkshire dialect.
The committee working in the Assembly, which is currently working on a draft law to change the name, took the following position: "Of course, the final decision on the future title of the members of the Assembly will be their own".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the right to change its name.
In June, the committee published the results of the public consultation on the proposal, and the re-appointment of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament was widely supported.
In addition, the committee supported the proposal to change the title of members of the assembly to "Member of the Welsh Parliament", i.e. WMP in English, although the abbreviation "MWP" enjoyed the greatest popularity among the public.
The members of the assembly are proposing alternative solutions. The difficulties of reaching a consensus are a hardship for Elin Jones, the speaker of the assembly, who is expected to present the bill in the coming weeks.
The law introducing the reforms will also take into account other changes in the way the Assembly works, including the rules for recalling members and the structure of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly will be able to vote on their future title during the discussion of the bill.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
In the coming Sunday, voters will decide whether their country will soon bear the name of the Republic of North Macedonia.
The general vote is meant to help end the decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which is home to a region called Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long claimed that the name of their northern neighbor is a territorial claim, and has repeatedly opposed attempts to join the European Union and NATO.
<0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov, the president of Macedonia and an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would disregard the results of the vote.
However, supporters of the plebiscite, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change is necessary to enable the state to join the European Union and NATO.
The bells in New York’s St. Martin’s Church are ringing due to church problems in Harlem
“The older people I’m talking to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” said Michael Henry Adams.
“There is currently no trace of them.”
As they say, the disappearance of bars is understandable.
“Currently, people socialize in a different way,” he noted.
“The bars have ceased to be the place of regular meetings of members of the community.”
In the case of churches, however, he is concerned that the funds from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as the decision-makers believe, and that "sooner or later they will be at the point of departure".
He added that the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings inhabited by people who would not support the other surrounding temples.
As he said: “The overwhelming majority of people buying apartments in such buildings will be white. This will speed up the complete closure of churches, because it is unlikely that new residents will become members of these parishes.”
Both churches were built by an assembly of white believers before Harlem joined the metropolitan community in 1870 (St. Martin's church joined the community a decade later).
The original assembly of white Methodists left the district in the 1930s.
The surrounding assembly of African-Americans then took over the ownership of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a congregation led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott against vendors from 125th Street (the main shopping street in Harlem), who opposed the employment or promotion of African Americans.
The 1939 fire severely damaged the building, but John Howard Johnson's parishioners made plans to rebuild the temple and commissioned the construction of a bell complex.
Reverend David Johnson, son of John Howard Johnson and his successor in St. Martin’s Church, proudly called the new carillon “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who knocked out the bells in July described them in a different way, as a “cultural treasure” and an “irreplaceable historical instrument”.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first carillon in the world supported by black music. This artist was Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved to Riverside Church, where a larger band was waiting for him.
Malcolm J. Merriweather said that St. Martin's Church did not replace him.
In recent months, a number of complex events have taken place in the Church of St. Martin with the participation of architects and performers, some of them brought to the place by the lay leaders of the Church, and some — the diocese of the Episcopal Church.
In July, the parish council (the governing body of the parish composed of lay leaders) addressed its concerns to the diocese, claiming that it “wants to shift the costs to the council”, although the council did not participate in hiring architects and contractors sent to the site.
Some parishioners also complain about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Scuba Diver in Search of Lobsters in California
Authorities reported that last Saturday, a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old scuba diver in search of lobsters in California. The incident occurred on the first day of the season on lobsters.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in the American city of Encinitas.
Chad Hammel reported to KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning he was diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard a cry for help. Immediately with a group of friends they sailed to the boy to help him get out of the water.
As Hammel said, at first it seemed to him that the boy was excited to catch a lobster, but he soon realized that the child was screaming: “I got bitten!
I've been bitten!"
Upon arriving at the scene, Chad Hammel noticed that the boy had completely torn skin around his collarbone.
“I started screaming to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” said Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Children's Council Hospital in San Diego, where his condition was classified as critical.
The species of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
During a press conference, Captain Larry Giles, a rescuer, said the fish had been spotted weeks earlier, but that it was not considered to belong to the endangered shark species.
Larry Giles added that the victim suffered serious injuries to the upper body.
In order to conduct the investigation and for security reasons, the authorities closed the entrance to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours.
Larry Giles noted that the area is home to more than 135 shark species, although most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's store network plans to expand its operations in the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s network throws gloves at stores such as Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, introducing to its supermarkets cosmetic departments citing the style of department stores, as well as specially trained retailers.
As part of a significant investment in the British cosmetics market – which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and is constantly growing despite the declines in the fashion industry and household goods – 11 stores belonging to the network will have larger shelves with cosmetic products. If successful, the next steps will be initiated.
The return to the cosmetics industry results from the search for ways to develop the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and household items.
According to Sainsbury's, the network will double the number of cosmetic products and will offer up to 3,000 items. In the assortment for the first time will appear goods from brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman or Dr. PawPaw.
Currently sold items by L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also receive more space and separate areas close to those known even from Boots stores.
In addition, the supermarket chain plans to refresh its offer of Boutique makeup products. From now on, most items will be vegan-friendly, which is increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, Fragrance Shop will create test points in two Sainsbury's supermarkets. The first opened last week in Croydon, in southern London, and the second will be held in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later in the year.
The prevalence of online sales and daily purchases of small amounts of food in local stores makes supermarkets more likely to encourage customers to visit.
Mike Coupe, president of Sainsbury’s, said the points of sale will increasingly resemble department stores as the network tries to fight discounters like Aldi or Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has placed Argos network points in hundreds of stores and has introduced a number of Habitat network points since the two companies took over two years ago. According to the company, this contributes to increased food sales and increased investment profitability.
The previous attempt to reorganize the departments with cosmetic products and pharmaceuticals ended in failure.
At the beginning of the 21st century, Sainsbury's created a joint-venture company with Boots as a trial. However, the cooperation ended after the conflict over the distribution of revenues from pharmacies operating in supermarkets.
Sainsbury’s is introducing a new strategy following the sale of 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
According to reports, Lloyds will contribute to the implementation of the plan, introducing an extended range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four online stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and character of our cosmetics departments to improve customer experience.
We have invested in special training for our colleagues so that they can help consumers with their purchases.
Our brands are able to meet every need, and the friendly environment and convenient locations allow us to attract the attention of customers looking for cosmetic products, as well as to question the existing ways of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract
Peter Jones, the star of Dragons' Den, was "angry" when he learned that Holly Willoughby was about to retire from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million lifestyle brand to focus on a newly established collaboration with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Holly Willoughby doesn’t have time for their brand of accessories and household items called Truly.
The activity was repeatedly compared to the Goop brand belonging to Gwyneth Paltrow.
This morning, a 37-year-old presenter announced her departure via Instagram.
The sudden decision to leave the thriving lifestyle brand and focus on the newly established collaboration with Marks & Spencer and ITV, taken by Holly Willoughby, angered Peter Jones, a Dragons' Den star.
According to sources, Peter Jones was “angry” when a popular TV presenter announced during a nervous Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that due to new contracts worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, he would not have time to devote to the art of hosting their marquee.
The company had previously been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and was also set to double Holly Willoughby's fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
After announcing the decision to leave the brand Truly by 37-year-old Holly Willoughby on Instagram, Peter Jones left the UK, going to one of his holiday homes.
According to a source, “The Truly brand was a priority for Holly Willoughby.
She had a future with her and wanted to take care of it for the next few decades.
The decision to withdraw from the business completely surprised all those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday. It was already so close to entering the market.
In the Marlow Warehouse, there are goods ready for sale.”
Experts believe that the resignation of the presenter of This Morning and one of the most successful stars in the UK could cost the company millions of pounds due to significant investments in products – including items from pillows to candles to clothing and household accessories – will also lead to a further increase in household supplies.
It can also mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Willoughby (mother of three children) and her husband Dan Baldwin have maintained close relationships with Peter Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Holly Willoughby and Tara Capp founded Truly in 2016, and 52-year-old Peter Jones joined them in March as president.
The couple spent their vacations together, and Jones held a 40 percent stake in Dan Baldwin’s television production company.
Holly Willoughby is set to become an M&S brand ambassador and replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Peter Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
Difficult conversation, "and then we fell in love"
The president joked about the media criticism of the remarks, which some considered to be "unfavorable to the husband of the state", as well as a positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said in a mocking voice, pretending to be a TV presenter:
“I didn’t surrender anything.”
The president noted that Kim Jong Un is interested in a second meeting. The first meeting took place in Singapore in June and was hailed by Trump as a big step towards the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on nuclear disarmament are lagging behind.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomacy chief Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that he did not see a “analogous response” from the United States to North Korea’s early disarmament efforts.
He noted that instead, the United States is maintaining sanctions and pressure.
President Trump expressed a much more optimistic view in his speech.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were planning a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
Now we have a great relationship.”
The president said his efforts to improve relations with Kim Jong Un had had positive effects: they led to the end of missile tests, helped free the hostages, and returned the rest of the U.S. troops home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when discussing his relationship with Kim Jong Un.
“It’s easy to behave after the presidential election, but instead of 10,000 people waiting outside and trying to get to the crowded stadium, we’d have 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing the finger at the crowd gathered directly in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia has destroyed one of the islands, killing hundreds of people.
After the earthquake on the island of Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that their help was not needed.
Despite the loss of the roof over the head by more than 10% of the inhabitants of Lombok, the authorities have not declared a natural disaster, which is a necessary condition for speeding up international aid efforts.
“Unfortunately, in many cases, the authorities have made it very clear that they are not asking for international support. So the situation is difficult,” said Selina Sumbung.
While Save the Children is preparing to travel to the Indonesian city of Palu, it is not yet certain whether international staff will be able to operate on the scene.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the national disaster agency, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if aid from international organisations should be allowed.
In the face of the shocks constantly felt in Indonesia, the country remains completely unprepared to cope with the forces of nature.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh province, they are a rarity for the rest of the coastline.
The lack of a tsunami warning siren in Pal – despite issuing a warning – likely had an impact on the death toll.
Even in the most favorable conditions, traveling between the Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters are making logistics even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which was stationed on the island of Lombok, is going to help the earthquake victims to the city of Palu. However, it will take at least three days to reach the destination.
President Joko Widodo has made the improvement of Indonesian infrastructure the main point of his campaign and has allocated a lot of funds to roads and railways.
However, in the run-up to next year’s election, the president’s administration is struggling with a lack of funds.
In addition, Joko Widodo found himself under pressure due to the country's ongoing religious tensions. Members of the majority Muslim community adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than a thousand people were killed, and tens of thousands of residents lost their roof over their heads as a result of fighting between Christian and Muslim gangs using machetes, bows, arrows and other simple weapons on the streets.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge wins the goal at the draw in a match with Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the English Premier League, scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's match at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pitch from Xherdan Shaqiri at a distance of about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal at 1:0 to the detriment of his team.
Before firing in the direction of a distant goal, he moved the ball to his left leg.
The ball swung high above the penalty area towards the right upper corner of the net.
Then she came to the gate, flying over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who was throwing herself at her.
“I was just trying to take the position and take the ball, knowing that players like Shaqiri are always trying to get it as far forward as possible. I wanted to give myself the best shot possible,” Sturridge said in an interview with LiverpoolFC.com.
“I noticed Kante approaching, I took the ball and I gave up the shot without a second thought.”
Chelsea led 1-0 in the middle of the match after the Belgian star Eden Hazard was shot in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward kicked the ball with his heel to Mateo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87>, then ran towards half Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> quickly accepted the application in the middle of the field.
He then made a beautiful forward play in the penalty box back to Hazard.
Hazard overtook the defenders and left footed shot towards the long pole that passed Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League on Wednesday at 15:00 at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 15:00 in London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has increased to 832 people
Indonesia’s natural disaster agency said on Sunday morning that the death toll from the country’s recent earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
During the conference, the spokesman of the agency Sutopo Purwo Nugroho reported that as a result of Friday's earthquake of 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale, many people were trapped under rubble. In addition, the quake caused a tsunami wave with a height of 6 meters.
Inhabited by more than 380,000 people, the city of Palu is full of rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of stabbing a woman.
After the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside County, a murder investigation was launched.
The 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking for contact from people in the area who have seen or heard any suspicious events.
Brian O'Hagan, Commissioner for Investigative Investigations, said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to all those who were at the time near John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious.
I also appeal to all drivers, and in particular to taxi drivers, whose registrars could have fixed the materials useful during the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman lived in Birkenhead and that her body was found inside the property.
In the afternoon, people claiming to know the woman arrived at the scene to find out where she was found.
Police said they were in the process of informing the victim’s family about the incident.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews recently tried to get into a residential building, but was informed by police that access to and exit from the facility is currently prohibited.
He hesitated when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been informed that they will not be able to return to their homes in the near future.
It was heard that one of the officers explained to the man that the area is currently considered a crime scene.
There was a crying woman at the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police cars were parked in the fenced area, and another police vehicle was parked nearby.
Inside the separated zone, there are officers guarding the residential building.
Persons with information are requested to contact Twitter (@MerPolCC) or by phone at 101, or to report anonymously via Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111, giving event number 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's memorial to British parliament's last victim in dispute over 'rewriting history'
The removal of the monument would bring justice for the Taliban’s reminiscent actions of destroying many English cultural and religious monuments by its radical, Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Society described Jeremy Crick's proposal as "crazy" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “Given the ongoing debate over the removal of monuments, the dispute over the character of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace was a matter of time.
The outrageous actions of the English Civil War were neither commissioned nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps for the actions of his ancestor Thomas a century earlier it was decided to punish not this Cromwell.
The manner in which Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft presented Cromwell at the monument testifies to the opinion this politician enjoyed in the 19th century and that for many people he is a character that is still worth remembering.
John Goldsmith said in an interview with The Sunday Telegraph: “For many people, Cromwell was seen – perhaps more often in the 19th century than now – as a defender of parliament from external pressures.
The assessment of how accurate this statement is is the subject of continuous historical debate.
It is certain, however, that the conflict of the mid-17th century shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable figure identifying one of the sides of division.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be celebrated and commemorated."
In China, there was a deadly disturbance of the farmer by a pig
According to local media, there was a deadly pig attack on a farmer at a market in southwestern China.
On Sunday, the South China Morning Post reported that a dead man named Yuan was found bleeding and with a severed artery near a pig at a market in Liupanshui City, Kuejczu Province.
A pig farmer prepares for vaccination in a pig farm on May 30, 2005, in Xining City, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, the man came to the market with his cousin from the neighboring province of Junnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning the cousin found the body of the man and noticed the open door to the nearby barn.
He said there was a big pig in the barn with blood on it.
The body section confirmed that it was a nearly 250-kilogram pig that had fatally disturbed the farmer.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeding and crumbling,” said a man named Wu, quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
The footage from the surveillance camera shows that Yuan arrived at the market on Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market manager said in an interview with Guiyang Evening News that during the gathering of evidence by the police, the beggar was isolated to avoid another attack.
According to reports, the man’s family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Cases of pig attacks on humans have already been reported, although they are rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts. The man suffered fatal wounds.
Ten years earlier in Wales, a nearly 300-kilogram pig had nailed a farmer to a tractor. The man’s wife managed to pull the animal away.
After eating a farmer from Oregon by pigs in 2012, one of the Manitoba farmers told CBC News that these animals are not usually aggressive, however, the taste of blood can trigger brutal behavior in them.
“They just want to play.
They're as inquisitive as children... they don't want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect,” he said.
The remains of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rains in the southwestern United States.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is losing strength, moving over the cooler waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days it will cause intense rainfall in northern Mexico and the southwestern part of the United States.
Hurricane Rosa is blowing at a speed of almost 137 km/h. On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. Eastern time, it was given category 1. It was then located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
According to forecasts, Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, it is beginning to form than heading east on the west coast of the United States. On Monday, Rosa will approach the California Peninsula in the form of a tropical storm, moving the masses of humid air northward, to the south.
On Monday it will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in parts of the territory of Mexico.
Over the next few days, the humid tropical air coming into contact with the approaching trough will cause torrential rains in the South West of the United States.
In some places, rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm in height will lead to sudden floods, displacement of pollutants and possible landslides in desert areas.
The humid tropical air will cause precipitation anywhere from 5 to 7.5 cm per hour. This applies especially to parts of the Nevada and Arizona areas.
Even 5 to 10 cm of rain is predicted in some areas of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall, sudden floods and rapid changes in conditions are possible.
In the face of the threat of tropical rain, it is strongly advised to move on foot through the desert area.
Abundant rains can turn canyons into rushing rivers, and lightning storms will cause local winds and dust to move.
Coming than it will bring abundant local rainfall on the coast of Southern California.
Rains with a total height above 1.3 cm are possible, which can cause small movements of pollution and danger on the roads.
This would be the first rainfall in the region.
Heavy tropical rains will begin to approach Arizona on a late Sunday and early Monday. On Monday afternoons and Tuesdays, rainfall will occur in a greater number of areas.
On Tuesday, heavy rains will reach the Four Corners region in the western part of the United States and will last until Wednesday.
In October, temperatures may fluctuate with cooling in the Arctic region throughout the United States, but in the intervertebral zone it will be rather warm.
This can lead to rapid changes in temperature over short distances.
A good example is the Sunday temperature difference in the central part of the United States.
The difference between Kansas City (Missouri) and Omaha (Nebraska) and between St. Louis (Missouri) and Des Moines (Iowa) is almost 10 degrees Celsius.
In the coming days, the summer temperatures may rise again.
In much of the central and eastern United States, a warm start is expected in October. Temperatures should range from 26 to 32 degrees Celsius in the area from the southern part of the Great Plains to the part of the Northeast.
On Tuesday in New York, the temperature can reach a value of up to 27 degrees Celsius, which is about 5 degrees above average.
Long-term climate forecasts indicate a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's auditions
More than 20 million people watched in six television stations moving Thursday’s hearing of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christina Blasey Ford, a woman accusing a lawyer of sexual harassment taking place in the 1980s.
Despite the ongoing political impasse on Friday, commentators had to interrupt regularly broadcast programs to inform of the sudden return: an agreement proposed by Senator Jeff Flake, according to which the FBI will conduct a weekly investigation into the charges.
Christine Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh had smeared her in a state of sobriety and tried to take her clothes off during a high school party.
In his emotional testimony, Kavanaugh said that he is convinced that such a situation did not occur.
It’s possible that Friday’s number of televisions was even higher than Nielsen’s 20.4 million.
The company counted the average number of television stations on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
However, for other stations, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, numerical data was not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has difficulty measuring visibility among people in the workplace.
The number given is close to the viewership of American football cup games or the award ceremony of the American Film Academy.
According to Nielsen, the Fox News Channel, whose presenters strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, had the highest viewership, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the full-day interview.
In second place was the ABC station with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest in the matter remained high after the hearing.
Jeff Flake has become a key figure in Friday’s events.
In the early hours of the morning, he was captured by CNN and CBS cameras after the office of this moderate Republican issued a statement that he had decided to support Kavanaugh's nomination. On the tape, he shouts at protesters who made it difficult for him to enter the elevator on the way to a court hearing.
Flake with his head down for a few minutes listened to unfavourable opinions. The whole event was broadcast by CNN.
“I stand here in front of you and ask.
Do you think he's telling the people the truth?
You have strength in the face of so many women’s impotence,” he heard from a woman demonstrating.
Before closing the elevator door, Jeff Flake said his office had issued an appropriate statement and would speak during the committee hearing.
Later, the television stations continued to broadcast the events in anticipation of the vote on the transmission of Kavanaugh's nomination in front of the entire Senate.
Flake said he would only support the nomination if he knew the FBI would investigate the charges in the coming week, which was demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was convinced in part by a conversation with his friend, Senator Chris Coons of the Democratic Party.
Flake made the decision after meeting with Chris Coons and several other senators.
Flake's election was important because Republicans would not have the votes needed to approve Brett Kavanaugh's nomination without investigation.
President Trump has opened the FBI's investigation into allegations levelled at Brett Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister Theresa May accuses critics of using Brexit to their advantage
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing the future of Britain and undermining the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on September 29, 2018.
In another interview alongside Theresa May on the front page, former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked a plan for future relations with the European Union in the wake of Brexit, according to which Britain and the EU could levy tariffs on their behalf, calling it “completely inadequate”.
Shooting of Wayde Sims: police arrested Dyteon Simpson suspected of murdering LSU player
Police have arrested the suspect in connection with the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player appearing in the colors of the University of Louisiana (LSU).
According to reports, the Baton Rouge police command of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson was arrested and placed in custody on charges of second-degree murder.
The authorities have released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson. Police reported that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the CBS-linked station WAFB, police officers found the glasses on the spot and found traces of Simpson's DNA on them.
Police said after Simpson's interrogation that he had confessed to shooting Wayde.
According to the lawyer of the detainee, the amount of bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner’s office in East Baton Rouge issued an initial report that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The police command expressed its gratitude to the Louisiana State Police Search Group, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police, and nearby residents for assisting in the investigation leading to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, director of sports at LSU, thanked local law enforcement for “workability and the pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
Measuring 198 cm, the man grew up in Baton Rouge. His father Wayne Sims also played basketball at LSU.
In his last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "crushed" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“It’s one of those things we’re always afraid of,” Will Wade said.
The ash emitted by the volcano reaches the city of Mexico
The ash extracted from the Popocatépetl volcano reached the southern districts of the capital of Mexico.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention (NDC) advised residents of Mexico to approach the volcano due to increased activity in the crater and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions over the course of 24 hours.
The center noted numerous tremors and tremors.
Photos posted on social media show the windshields of cars covered with a thin layer of ash in Mexico’s neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake that hit Mexico in September 2017, geophysicists have seen an increase in the activity of a volcano 72 km southeast of the country’s capital.
The volcano, also known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence referendum
On Saturday in Barcelona, six people were arrested as a result of clashes between demonstrators in support of Catalonia's independence with police preventive forces. On that day, thousands of people took part in hostile demonstrations commemorating the first anniversary of the extremely emotional referendum on the secession of Catalonia.
A group of masked supporters of the separation threw eggs and powder paint at police officers. Dark clouds of dust engulfed the streets usually full of tourists.
The clashes also occurred in the later part of the day. In order to stop the fighting, police forces used sticks.
For several hours, the pro-independence groups chanted “We do not forget, we do not forgive”. Opponents of the secession shouted “Long live Spain”.
According to the local press, fourteen people have received medical assistance in connection with minor injuries sustained during the protests.
After a year since the referendum of October 1, the tension does not subside. Although the authorities in Madrid considered them illegal, it is still a reason to celebrate for those wishing to secede from Catalonia.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence. However, the turnout was low due to a widespread boycott of opponents.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost a thousand people were injured last year in brutal clashes with police trying to prevent voting in polling stations.
On Friday evening, groups of people supporting the independence of the region decided to prevent a demonstration supporting the police.
The demonstration took place in spite of this, however, a change of route was forced.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for independence from Catalonia.
“Last year we experienced some of our most beautiful moments in our lives.
My parents were crying with joy that they could vote. But now we are stuck at a point with no way out," he said.
Despite a significant but small victory in the local elections in December last year, the parties supporting the secession of Catalonia have difficulty with the continuation of action. Many of the most recognized leaders have decided to leave or are awaiting arrest for the process in connection with the referendum.
Joan Puig, a forty-two-year-old mechanic recording a police-supporting protest by phone, said politicians on both sides of the dispute fueled the conflict.
“The situation is becoming increasingly tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained since the end of last year, announced his willingness to run in next year’s European Parliament elections.
“Candidateing in elections to the European Parliament is the best way to condemn the crisis of democratic values of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men Arrested After Driving Into Their Home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested in the aftermath of a multiple car accident at a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 p.m. British time (BST).
Detective Commissioner Bob Blemmings said the damage covered the gate and the building.
At some point in the direction of the car, a shot from the bush could also be fired.
Mengi goal secures Livingston victory over Rangers 1:0
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston brought the team a win
Livingston, who has played in the extra-class since that season, stunned the Rangers, giving Steven Gerrard only his second defeat in his 18 games as the club's coach at Ibrox Park.
Dolly Menga's goal proved to be a win, and Gary Holt's team moved to second place in the table occupied with Hibernian.
The team led by Gerrard remains this season without a win on the way out of the Premiership. Next Sunday, the team will face the leader of Hearts, to which he loses eight points.
Earlier, on Thursday, the Rangers will host Rapid Vienna as part of the UEFA Europa League.
Livingston is extending a series of victories in his division to six games. Coach Holt has not experienced a defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed a few opportunities against undisposed opponents
The team led by Holt was supposed to have taken over much earlier, as the team's game brought a lot of problems to the Rangers.
First Scott Robinson broke through the defense and fired a shot into the goal, but he failed to shoot the goal. Then Alan Lithgow failed to hit after taking over Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts allowed the Rangers to play closer to the goal, knowing that they could threaten their rivals during constant game fragments.
And this is how the decisive gate fell.
After the Rangers' free throw, Livingston's team found an opportunity, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson jointly created the situation of Mendze, who scored a goal from the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had more possession, but they were unable to force the hosts to defend and did not cause more problems to goalkeeper Liam Kelly.
Alfredo Morelos fired a single shot at Kelly's goal in the second half.
Scott Pittman's attempt was defended by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow failed to catch the light of the goal from the next solid leg sent to Livingston.
The Rangers continued the attacks in Livingston's penalty area, but were unable to take advantage of the situation. They demanded two penalty kicks after Halkett's intervention against the substitute Glenn Middleton and one hand play. In both cases, however, the claims of the players were rejected.
Livingston’s “Fenomenal” Performance – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Almondvale Park
Great performance and result for Livingston.
In his opinion, they played great, once again exceeding expectations.
Their style and composition have hardly changed since their return to the extra class. However, Holt should be appreciated for motivating the team to play.
This game had a lot of heroes.
Captain Craig Halkett played a huge role in directing a well-organized defense, while Menga made sure Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall had to be very careful throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked the will to fight.
Although under Gerrard's leadership they have great moments, in this match they did not maintain their standards.
In their game, something seemed to be missing: only once managed to break through the defense of the hosts. This should be a serious warning for the Rangers, who found themselves in the middle of the table.
Mixed reactions to Erdogan’s visit to Cologne
During a Saturday breakfast in Berlin (29 September), the leaders of Turkey and Germany were accompanied by smiles and beautiful weather.
This was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was intended to improve relations between NATO allies.
Disputes have led to differences on issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
After the meeting, Erdogan went to Cologne, where he opened a new, huge mosque.
The city has the largest number of Turks living outside its homeland.
According to the police, for security reasons, a crowd of 25 thousand gathered in front of the temple was blocked. However, supporters of the president gathered in the area to see their leader.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents – including many Kurds – also decided to voice their opinion, denouncing the Turkish leader’s policy and the German government’s decision to adopt the policy in the country.
The anti-protests reflect the divisions caused by the visit of a politician called a hero by some Turks living in Germany and considered autocracy by others.
Road accident in Deptford: a cyclist died as a result of a collision with a car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the crowded intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street in Deptford, the city's southeastern district, at about 10:15 a.m.
After the incident, the driver stopped the vehicle, and medical rescuers arrived at the scene. Despite the intervention, the man died at the scene of the accident.
A few months ago, on Childers Street (about a mile and a half from the scene of Saturday's accident), another fatal accident involving a cyclist occurred, and the perpetrator fled the scene.
The Metropolitan Police reported that officers are working to identify the deceased man and to inform the family members of the incident.
Roads were closed and bus tours were organized, and drivers were advised to avoid the nearby area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured as a Result of Riots
According to the agency's authorities, six officers were injured as a result of riots in a penal facility for men with a high level of security.
The riots at the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire began at around 9:30 a.m. British time (BST) on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Eight inmates in one of the plant’s wings were called to the “Tornado” specialist unit.
The officers on the scene suffered minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the facility said: “Specially trained personnel were involved in the action at the HMP Long Lartin penal facility.
Six of the officers suffered minor injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our facilities. We are confident that those responsible will be handed over to the police and they can spend more time in prison."
The HMP Long Lartin is home to more than 500 prisoners, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
According to reports in June, the plant director had to go to the hospital after being attacked by one of the prisoners.
In October last year, the plant was called to the prevention units due to the dangerous riots, in which employees were attacked with bullets to play billiards.
Sudden floods caused by Hurricane Rosa threaten Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (possible beneficial impact on drought-affected areas)
It is rare for a tropical depression to reach the state of Arizona. It is likely to occur early next week. The remains of Hurricane Rosa move through the desert areas of the Southwest, posing a threat of flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued a warning about the possibility of flash floods on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
According to forecasts on Tuesday, Rosa will pass directly over Phoenix. On Monday afternoon, the rain will begin.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported via Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained a storm or tropical depression at a distance of 320 km from Phoenix.
Hurricane Katrina (in 1967) approached a distance of 65 km from the Arizona state border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 5 to 10 cm in height. In some areas of Mogollon Rim in Arizona can reach a height of up to 15 cm.
In other desert areas of the Southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, precipitation is likely to range from 2.5 to 5 cm, and in some areas up to 10 cm.
People outside the flood-prone areas associated with Hurricane Rosa may be relieved as the region has been struggling with drought for some time.
Although floods pose a serious threat, some of the rainfall will improve the situation in the South West, where droughts prevail.
According to weather.com, the U.S. Drought Monitor estimates that nearly 40% of the Arizona area is struggling with severe droughts belonging to the second-highest category.
Hurricane Rosa will arrive first on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa continued to move with hurricane force, reaching speeds of up to 137 km/h. It is now located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and heading north at a speed of 19 km/h.
The hurricane meets the cooler waters of the Pacific Ocean, which causes it to weaken.
According to forecasts, it will hit Mexico with a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Intense rainfall in some parts of Mexico can pose a major flood hazard.
The weather.com portal reported that "in the area from the California Peninsula to the northwestern part of the state of Sonora, precipitation is expected to be between 7 and 15 cm in height, although they can reach 25 cm."
Then Hurricane Rosa will pass through Mexico in the northern direction in the form of a tropical storm. On Tuesday, in the early morning hours, it will reach the Arizona border as a tropical depression. By Tuesday evening, it will travel to the southern part of the state of Utah.
“The most serious threat posed by Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is very heavy rainfall on the California Peninsula, in the northwestern part of Sonoran state, and in the southwestern desert areas of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
According to forecasts, rains will cause life-threatening flash floods and displacement of pollution in the desert and muddy avalanches in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four People Arrested in Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on charges of attempted murder of a 16-year-old boy found with stab wounds in Somerset County.
The boy was found at Excelsior Terrace, in Midsomer Norton, on Saturday, at about 4:00 a.m. British time (BST).
The victim was taken to the hospital and her condition remains "stable".
According to police reports from Avon and Somerset, one 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in the Radstock area.
Officials are asking for contact from all persons with recordings of the event.
Trump Says Brett Kavanaugh ‘Feeled the Ignorance and Anger’ of the Democratic Party
“The voice cast for Judge Kavanaugh is a voice against the reckless and outrageous conduct of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh “felt the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party during the nomination process.
On Thursday, Brett Kavanaugh testified before Congress. He firmly and emotionally denied the accusations of Christina Blasey Ford. The woman claims that a few decades ago, when they were both teenagers, the man committed sexual assault against her.
Ford also testified during the hearing on the allegations she had made.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, “Americans could see the brilliance, class, and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“The voice given to Judge Kavanaugh is the voice of support for one of the most outstanding lawyers of our time, a law expert of great merit to the community,” he told a crowd of supporters at a rally in West Virginia.
The president did not directly refer to the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh, discussing the importance of the Republican turnout in the mid-term elections.
“The most important election in our lives is five weeks away.
I don’t start in this election, but I remain very active,” he said.
"I'm still fighting to defend our great candidates."
Trump says Democrats are pursuing a policy of “standing up to resistance and hindering activity.”
As one of the Republican Party’s senior policy aides told CNN, the first key Senate vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Hundreds of victims of earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia. The number of victims is growing
At least 384 people were killed, many of them by high waves crashing into beaches, as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
On Friday in Palu, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to take part in the festival taking place in the city. At dusk, the waves hit the shore reaching up to 6 meters in height, kidnapping many people and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was the result of an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
“When the threat arose yesterday, the people on the beach did not immediately escape and fell victim to the tsunami,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPD natural disaster agency, told a conference in Jakarta.
"Tsunami attacked everything on their way, hijacking cars, logs and houses," Nugroho said, adding that before reaching the shoreline, the elements were moving at 800 km/h.
As he said, some were rescued by climbing trees and managed to survive.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
In the aerial photos published by the agency for natural disasters, you can see many destroyed houses and shops, damaged and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was visited by secondary shocks.
In the area inhabited by 2.4 million people, there were a number of earthquakes.
According to the Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Exploitation (BPPT), the energy released by the extensive Friday earthquake was about two hundred times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The statement stated that the geographical location of the city, which is located at the end of a long, narrow bay, could have exacerbated the effects of the tsunami.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho described the damage as "significant" and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He added that the bodies of some of the victims were found under collapsed buildings, 540 people were injured, and 29 people are considered missing.
Nugroho said the fatalities and damage may be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which was closer to the earthquake epicenter.
According to Nugroh, the communication "has been completely paralyzed", so there are no reports from the province of Donggala.
“There are more than 300,000 people living there,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that the organization’s employees and volunteers are going to places affected by the disaster.
“We can already speak of a tragedy, although the situation may be significantly worsened,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the agency met with widespread criticism due to the lack of information about the tsunami strike in Palu. However, the authorities said that the waves came right after the warning was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man screaming from the building, trying to warn of the coming tsunami of people on the street.
Within a few minutes, the water wall smashed against the shore, robbing buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the recording.
The earthquake and tsunami caused significant power shortages, preventing communication within Palu, which in turn made it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military began sending transport planes with the help of Jakarta and other cities, however, people evacuated still very much need food and other basic necessities.
The airport located in the city is open only for humanitarian transport. The airport will remain inactive until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the centers for people evacuated in Palu.
More than 800 tsunami victims in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
According to Doseba T. Sinai, World Vision’s national director, the organization’s personnel arrived safely from Donggala province to Palu city and found shelter in tarpaulin tents placed in the office courtyard. Along the way, the workers passed many deserted areas.
“They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some groups are slowly beginning to provide assistance, there have been criticisms that foreign aid workers with a wealth of experience are being prevented from travelling to Pal.
According to Indonesian law, the reception of funding, resources and personnel from abroad can only begin after the announcement of the disaster site as an area of national disaster.
This has not been done yet.
"Officially, we are still dealing with a disaster of regional scope," a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross said.
“When the government recognizes that there has been a national disaster, we will be able to start accepting international aid, but that has not happened yet.”
Two days after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami in Palu, friends and family of the missing continue to hope that their loved ones will somehow find themselves in the midst of destruction.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from the canals.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who spent two days under rubble next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of Indonesia’s paragliding team, trained two missing paragliders at this month’s Asian Games in Indonesia.
As Petra Mandagi said, other people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
“As an experienced paraglider, I am struggling with my own emotional burden,” he said.
Gendon Subandono told how, within hours of the appearance among the paragliding community, Roa Roa desperately sent messages via WhatsApp to athletes taking part in the festival on the beach.
His messages were marked with only one gray hook instead of a pair of blue hooks.
“I think it means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves Steal $26,750 While Complementing Cash at ATM in Newport on the Levee Shopping Mall
According to a statement from the Newport police command, on Friday morning, the thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who supplemented cash at an ATM in the Newport on the Levee shopping centre.
“The driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to replenish the cash,” Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
Another man “runs from behind to a Brink employee” and steals a bag of money into an ATM machine.
According to the statement, the witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the theft.
All persons with information about the identity of the thief are requested to contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West has decided to change his name to Ye.
In a Twitter post on Saturday, he wrote about himself: “A person previously known as Kanye West.”
The forty-one-year-old musician has been using the pseudonym Ye for some time now. It is also the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change took place before a visit to Saturday Night Live. During the performance, the artist is expected to present his new album called Yandhi.
He will replace singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the creators, resigned from the program for "emotional reasons".
West has previously stated that the word "Ye" is not only an abbreviation of its current artistic adjective, but has religious significance.
“It seems to me that ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible. In the Bible, it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year, discussing the title of the album with a radio presenter nicknamed Big Boy.
“So I’m you, I’m us, it’s about us.
First I was Kanye, which means the only person. Now I am Ye – a reflection of all our good, bad and messy qualities.
The album shows who we are.”
West was among the other famous rappers who decided to change their name.
Sean Combs, nicknamed Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, and Diddy, announced this year that he wants to be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborator, also recorded his pseudonym in various ways, with a connector, without a connector and capital letters.
Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador pledges not to use military force against civilians
On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the bloody suppression of student demonstrations, Mexican President-elect Andrés Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador (AMLO) pledged never to use the military against civilians.
On Saturday, L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised to “never use the military to repress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on the square in the direction of a peaceful demonstration, killing as many as 300 people. The event occurred at a time when leftist student movements began to develop throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised to support Mexico’s young residents by providing monthly financial assistance to students, as well as by creating more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities push young people towards criminal groups.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence research
According to Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and artificial intelligence expert working for Google, Microsoft and Apple, as China’s activity in this area increases, the United States should double its spending on research in the field of IS.
The attention has to do with the announcements on artificial intelligence published by various U.S. government agencies, despite the fact that the U.S. does not have an official strategy regarding IS.
Last year, China unveiled its plan to become the most innovative country in the field of artificial intelligence by 2030.
“To begin with, we need to double the budget for research on SI: all other countries are far beyond the United States, and we are trying to make another breakthrough in this area,” said Kai-Fu Lee.
In an interview with CNBC this week, he also said that doubling the funds could double the chances of making another breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence in the United States.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the president of Sinovation Ventures. He is the founder of SinoVentures.
In the 1980s, Kai-Fu Lee worked at Carnegie Mellon University to create an SI system that defeated the then-best American player in the Othello game. He then took a leadership position in Microsoft Research and was president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee acknowledged the success of the U.S. government’s previous technology initiatives, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)’s competition for the most interesting robot projects. He also asked about the next edition of the competition, as he said he would find the next edition of the competition.
As Kai-Fu Lee said, scientists in the United States often have to work hard to get government subsidies.
“It’s not China that gets us the best academics, it’s corporations,” Lee said.
For several years now, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring outstanding scientists to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help the United States in the development of SI.
“I believe that people who are involved in artificial intelligence, who have obtained a doctoral degree, should automatically be awarded a green card,” he said.
In July 2017, the Chinese State Council published a plan to create the next generation of artificial intelligence.
As Lee noted, China’s National Natural Science Foundation (National Science Foundation of China) provides funding to members of academic institutions in a manner similar to the U.S. National Science Foundation and other government organizations granting funding to U.S. scientists.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center (JITC) to engage industry and science partners, while the White House announced the creation of a Special Commission on Artificial Intelligence (Select Committ).
This month, DARPA also announced a $2 billion grant for an initiative called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation is currently investing more than $100 billion a year in research on SI.
At the same time, the U.S. initiative to create a national commission on artificial intelligence security has not moved forward for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the name of their country
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia. This move would allow to cancel the decades-long dispute with Greece, which blocks the country's efforts to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, on the territory of the historic country of Macedonia, maintains that the name of the northern neighbor is a claim to its territory. Therefore, it vetoed the country's accession to the EU and NATO.
In June, the governments of the two countries reached an agreement on naming, but nationalists say the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority living in Macedonia.
President <0xC7><0xB4>orge Ivanov said he would not take part in the vote. The campaign to encourage a boycott has raised doubts as to whether the turnout will reach the minimum level of 50% required to consider a referendum binding.
The referendum asked the following question: “Do you support joining NATO and the EU following the adoption of the agreement with Greece?”
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, argue that it is worth paying the price for the possibility of Macedonia – one of the countries created after the fall of Yugoslavia – joining such organizations as the European Union or NATO.
"I voted for the future of my country so that the young people of Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union. Membership in the EU will give us all greater security," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijewska from Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of parliamentarians have declared that they will respect the results of the vote.
The name change requires the support of two-thirds of the members of parliament.
The National Electoral Commission has informed that no unusual events have been recorded until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout at this time was only 16% compared to 34% in the last parliamentary elections in 2016. Then 66% of eligible people voted.
"I voted because of my children. Our place is in Europe," said 62-year-old <0xC7><0xB4>osze Tanewski, a voter from Skopje.
On September 30, 2018, in Strumica, Macedonia, Prime Minister Zoran Zaew, his wife Zorica and son Duszko voted in a referendum to change the country’s name to open the way to membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kawardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of tents spread by people boycotting the referendum.
“We support membership in NATO and the EU, but we want to join these organizations with their heads held high, not their back doors,” Kawardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to other countries, such as China or Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaew says that NATO membership will bring the necessary investments to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is more than 20%.
“I believe that the vast majority will support changing the name in the referendum, because 80% of citizens support the European Union and NATO,” Zaev said after the vote.
He said the “yes” vote was a “confirmation of our future.”
In a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute of Public Research, from 30 to 43% of voters declared their willingness to participate in the referendum. This is less than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by Macedonian TV, Telma TV plans to vote 57% of the respondents in Sunday’s referendum.
70% of respondents said they would support the name change.
In order for the vote to be successful, the turnout must be 50% + 1 vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to pro-Western government policy since taking power in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City defeats Brighton’s entire defence and wins the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling sent home Brighton's defence in Saturday's 2-0 draw for Manchester City. The match was played at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
The goal scored by Aguera in 65 minutes looked childishly easy.
The action began with a pitch in the middle of the field to an Argentine striker.
The player overtook Brighton's three defenders.
Then Aguero was among the four players of Brighton.
He first played one of them and then overtook the others and found himself on the edge of Brighton’s penalty area.
He then played the ball to the left, where Sterling was waiting for her.
The English striker immediately handed the ball back to Aguera in the penalty area, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the goal.
“Aguero is dealing with a foot injury,” Manchester City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We talked about the possibility of playing 55, 60 minutes.
And that's exactly what happened.
We were lucky that he had a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who secured the blue first lead in the Premier League match.
The goal in question fell in the 29th minute.
In this action, Aguero received the ball deep in the middle of Brighton.
He sent a great pitch along the left side of the pitch to Leroy Sane.
Sane made several moves, allowing Sterling to move to the far pole.
The Manchester City striker put the ball into the net just before it hit the car.
Manchester City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the UEFA Champions League on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. The meeting will take place at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to destroy the chances of winning the Rockies
After losing the chance to participate in the play-off by the Washington Nationals, Scherzer did not have to appear in the first team.
However, the rival Scherzer hopes to make it to Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, as long as the Rockies keep their chances of playing in the play-off phase. Currently, the team has one more win than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West division.
The Rockies can count on at least a wild card if they win the Friday game against the Nationals with a 5:2 score. However, they still want to get their first division champion title.
“Even though we’re playing ‘nothing’, at least we’ll get out on the pitch, knowing that the atmosphere in Denver and the opponents’ performance will be at the highest level, as in the rest of the season.
Why wouldn’t I want to be in this meeting?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starting pitcher for Sunday's meeting, but the team is leaning towards putting Scherzer on the front line.
This would be Scherrer's thirty-fourth appearance in the first team. The player took part in Thursday's shooting practice and is hoping to perform on Sunday.
The right-hander of the Washington team scores 18-7 and ERA 2.53. He eliminated the goaltenders 300 times and scored 220 and 2/3 rounds in the season.
So Trump in West Virginia
Trump did not directly refer to his nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as a Supreme Court justice, discussing the importance of Republican turnout in the mid-term elections.
“In November, we are putting all our achievements to the test.
One of the most important choices in our lives is five weeks apart.
Although I do not start, I remain very active. I constantly defend our great candidates," he said.
Then he continued: “We are dealing with a terrible group of radical Democrats. We see their actions with our own eyes.
They're determined to take power by any means possible, they're mean and mean.
They don't care who they hurt and who they have to hurt to gain power and control. Taking power and control is their goal. But we won't give it to them."
As he said, the Democrats are carrying out the mission of “putting up resistance and hindering activity.”
“It’s been very good to see this in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “bad, mean, unpleasant and untrue.”
The president referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, citing the name and the name of the U.S. Senator from the Democratic Party Dianne Feinstein, which was met with a loud commotion from the crowd.
“Do you remember her answer?
Are you responsible for leaking the document?
“Uh, are you listening?
No... I mean... no." Her body language was fatal. It was the worst body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a group of people with different views.
The party is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momentum activists in my party voted to reprimand me, I was not surprised.
Finally, I am a member of a group of Labour MEPs who have recently been told that they are not welcome, all because of their own opinions.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan has met with similar treatment because she opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, the request for reprimand was based on a difference of opinion between me and Jeremy Corbyn.
The differences concerned the importance of responsible economic policy, national security and Europe. Ironically, Jeremy Corbyn opposed the position of previous leaders on these issues.
In a Friday announcement of a meeting of Labour MPs from Nottingham East, it was possible to read: “We want the meetings to be open and productive”.
For the eight years I have served as a Labour Party Member, this is what most of the General Committee’s Friday afternoon meetings looked like.
Unfortunately, many meetings are now going differently, and the promise of a “more cordial and milder” policy has long been forgotten, as long as it has ever been remembered.
It is increasingly obvious that the Labour Party does not tolerate different views. Each opinion is evaluated in terms of compliance with the leadership of the party.
It all started shortly after Jeremy Corbyn took over as president. Colleagues, for whom I thought we had similar views, began to expect me to change direction and take positions that I would not have previously agreed with. They were concerned with the EU as they were.
After every public appearance – regardless of the content – I meet on social media with attacks calling for the removal of nominations, the condemnation of centrism or the abandonment of the Labour Party.
This is not just my experience.
I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the remarks directed at me are rather political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who experience sexist or racist treatment on a daily basis, but do not avoid further action.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the current policy is to move to the agenda of offending others.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should support a culture of tolerance.
In fact, we are no longer a group of people with different views. With every request for a “vote of no confidence” and every change in the rules of choice, the party’s worldview becomes narrower.
Over the past two years, I have been repeatedly suggested not to bend over and keep quiet about certain issues, and then everything would be "okay".
But that’s not why I’m concerned with politics.
Since joining the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student as a result of the negligence of the government of Margaret Thatcher, which led to the breakdown of my school class, I have been trying to ensure a better quality of public services for those in need – both as a local councillor and as a minister.
I never hid my beliefs, even during the last election campaign.
Everyone in Nottingham East knew my position and knew about the differences of opinion with the party authorities.
To the people who supported Friday’s proposal, I want to say that I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the Labour leader in the face of an impending Brexit that will harm households, businesses and public services.
The most important message I am sending, however, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents (both members of the Labour Party and others): I am proud to be of service to you. I promise that no threats to withdraw nominations or temporary political goals will discourage me from acting in accordance with all my beliefs and beliefs.

Ayr versus Melrose 38:17 – undefeated Ayr climbs again
Two late innings could have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a win in this extremely interesting Scottish Extraliga match.
The team placed first in the table and remains the only undefeated team.
In the end, this distinguished defense and better use of the chances led the team hosts to victory. Coach Peter Murchie could be pleased with his subordinates.
“The previous matches were a challenge for us, but we are still undefeated, so I’m happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of the Melrose team said: “We have to pay our respects to the Ayr players. They took advantage of us better than we did.”
Ayr went on the lead in the 14th minute after applying Grant Anderson and raising Frazier Climate. However, a yellow card for Rory Hughes' injury, who came to the team from the Glasgow Warriors, allowed Melrose to equalize the score when Jason Baggot hit the pitch.
Climo increased Ayr's lead after kicking off a penalty kick just before the end of the first half. He first won the over, and then took the chance to raise, scoring 17:5 for Ayr.
Melrose started well in the second half. Patrick Anderson's raise by Baggot reduced the loss to five points.
Then there was a longer suspension of the game due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott. The player was removed from the field on stretchers. After the resumption of Ayr increased the lead after the addition of Stafford McDowal and the rise of the Clima.
The team captain, Ayr Blair Macpherson, was given a yellow card. Melrose re-used his number: an approach with an unsuccessful attempt to raise Bruce Colvin reduced the lead.
The hosts took the initiative when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for knocking down Climate without a ball. MacPherson gained an edge on the back of the approaching defense.
Climo took advantage of the opportunity to raise, then again managed to raise the score just after the restart of the game, when Kyle Rowe caught the shot from the penalty kick and enabled winger Gregor Henry to get a fifth goal for the hosts.
The star of the series Still Game begins his career in the food industry
Ford Kieran, star of the series Still Game, seems to be starting a business in the food industry. Recently, it was discovered that he was the director of the company managing restaurants.
The 56-year-old actor stars as Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC sitcom, performing and co-creating the series with his longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphille.
The duet announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last in the history of the series. Everything indicates that Ford Kiernan is already planning for the future after leaving "Craiglang".
According to official data, he became the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, though a Scottish Sun informant suggested that Kiernan was trying to engage in a "developing food industry" in Glasgow.
“The sea belongs to us”: Bolivia’s lack of access to the sea gives hope that the court will reopen its way to the Pacific
Marines patrol the area around the naval base in La Paz.
There are blue flags in public buildings.
In the ports of the Navy from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon there is the following motto: “The sea is ours by law.
It is our duty to get him back.”
With no access to the Bolivian sea, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody conflict over resources of the 19th century is still alive. Just like the dream of sailing across the Pacific Ocean again.
These hopes are perhaps the highest in decades. Bolivia is awaiting the judgment of the International Court of Justice. It is due to be issued on October 1 after a five-year process.
“Bolivia’s actions are gaining momentum. Residents are unanimous, optimistic and expect a favorable verdict,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country will watch a joint session of the International Court of Justice. They hope that the organization based in The Hague will recognize Bolivia’s claim and after decades of fruitless talks Chile will have to enter into negotiations on granting statehood.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who will face a controversial re-election battle next year, also puts his hopes on Monday’s ruling.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he said at the end of August.
Some analysts say, however, that the chances of a favorable decision for Bolivia are small and that even a favorable decision would not change much.
The United Nations body based in The Hague does not have the authority to grant Bolivia the territory of Chile. It also provided that it will not affect the determination of possible talks.
As Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law, said, the International Court of Justice’s decision will be issued six months after the final arguments were presented. So short a time shows that the case “wasn’t complicated”.
Unfortunately, Bolivia has been able to keep the country away from its target for the past four years.
“The issue of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate.
Morales’ relentless rhetoric deprived the Chileans of any remnants of goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will resume talks at some point, but it will be very difficult in the face of the situation.
Since 1962, there has been no exchange of ambassadors between the two countries.
Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, former president and representative of Bolivia in The Hague, disagreed with the view that the court’s decision-making process was extremely fast.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a unique opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and the possibility of "ending the 139-year period of disputes with regard to mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales — still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents — used the issue of access to the sea as part of a political game.
“Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The verdict is a great opportunity to see that we have to deal with the past.”
North Korea’s leaders say nuclear disarmament won’t happen until they can trust the United States.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his nation will never get rid of nuclear weapons as long as it can trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to keep the promises made during the summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two countries.
His comments came as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming suspended nuclear diplomacy more than three months after meeting in Singapore with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri argues that the “scratch” is that the lack of lifting sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War has ever brought North Korea to its knees.
Washington does not want to sign the declaration without Pyongyang taking concrete steps to disarm it.
Both Kim Jong Un and US President Donald Trump want another meeting.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about dismantling the arsenal, which is seen in North Korea as the only means of ensuring security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month as part of preparations for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Parisian fashion shows herald the emergence of the latest line of large headwear in clothing stores.
If you want to enlarge your collection of hats or completely hide from the sun, then we have good information for you.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented a series of crazy, oversized head coverings included in their summer 2019 collection, which shone with style during Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats were on Instagram this summer. The mentioned designers decided to present their stunning creations on the runway.
Valentino's outstanding work was a giant beige hat decorated with a wide, feathery round filling the heads of models.
Other oversized accessories included watermelons adorned with jewels, a wizard’s hat, and even pineapple — but they weren’t designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also showed a number of strange masks — in time for Halloween.
Many colorful masks had their mouths sewn and resembled the style of Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment with a tube and glasses, and the other looked like melted ice cream.
And if you don't want to break with great fashion, you're in luck.
Spectators of styles predict that huge hats can hit the clothing stores.
The immeasurable hats follow just behind “La Bomba”, a straw hat with a 61 cm wide round, which was already worn by everyone – from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this extremely impractical hat, which has spilled over into social media, presented another great creation on the runway – a straw beach bag almost as big as the model wearing it, dressed in a bathing suit.
The burnt orange raffle bag, finished with raffle fringes and topped with a white leather handle, stood out in the Jacquemus La Riviera collection for the 2019 summer season during Paris Fashion Week.
Star designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to pop up in stores next summer — because the designer has managed to make such an impact, it would be hard not to take advantage of the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: language skills necessary for the citizens of the world
Independent schools in Scotland are constantly enjoying their scientific achievements – in 2018 they were able to boast of another excellent exam results, supported by individual and collective successes in sport, art, music and other social endeavors.
Represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), schools attended by more than 30,000 students across Scotland strive to provide the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare students for further and higher education, the career paths chosen by them and to indicate their role as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that has the opportunity to develop and implement a curriculum tailored to the needs of the school, we see that modern languages are still popular and desirable subjects to choose from in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you speak to another person in a language that they understand, it goes to their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.”
It’s a clear reminder that we can’t just rely on English when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The results of the last exam this year show that languages occupy the first place in league rankings, with the highest scores occurring in the case of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages received a higher grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students received a higher grade A in Mandarin, and 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students also received an A grade.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Currently, learning languages as subjects to choose from is conducted in the same scope as learning STEM subjects (strict sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics) as part of teaching programs in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UK Commission for Employment and Skills) found that 17 per cent of employers reported a lack of language skills in their candidates due to difficulties in filling vacancies.
Therefore, more and more language skills are becoming a necessity to prepare young people to start a professional career.
These skills are essential in a globalised world with a growing number of jobs requiring language skills.
A lifelong skill, like learning a second language, will provide a huge advantage in the future — no matter what career path you take.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically increases the chances of a multilingual person in relation to the competition.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults, 75% of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was the only language with a two-digit percentage of those using it, i.e. 15%.
That’s why investing in foreign language learning is so important for today’s children.
Knowledge of several languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will give children a better chance of finding a suitable job.
In Scotland, each school will be different in terms of the languages it teaches.
Many schools will focus on more classical modern languages, while others will be teaching languages deemed most important to the UK in the 2020 perspective, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Regardless of the child’s interests, there will always be many languages to choose from in independent schools, which will be taught by teaching staff specialized in this area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed — no matter what the future holds for them.
At present, it cannot be denied that in an international business environment, languages are still crucial to the future of the country, and so this must be reflected in education.
Modern languages should be treated as ‘international communication skills’.
Independent schools will continue to offer Scottish youth a wide choice, diversity and level.
It's just the right thing to do.
John Edward, President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron made his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego.
Fans who want to see LeBron James' Los Angeles Lakers debut are finally looking forward to it.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that LeBron James will play a Sunday pre-season game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
We don’t know how many minutes he will play.
“More than one, but less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell said on Twitter that James is likely to play the full number of minutes.
After the training, which took place earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for six pre-season Lakers games.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need to take part in pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
So Trump's election in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of election rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s five electoral rallies scheduled to take place next week, along with stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
Along with a vote confirming his suspension of his election to a vacant seat on the Supreme Court, Trump is seeking to build support in the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans could face losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time will Trump’s election in West Virginia take place tonight, and where will he be seen on the Internet?
So Trump’s election in Wheeling, West Virginia, will take place today at 7 p.m., Saturday, September 29, 2018.
So Trump’s election in West Virginia will be live-streamed on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak about this week’s hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which took place in a tense atmosphere in connection with allegations of sexual misconduct, as well as the expected vote in the Senate on a one-off election.
However, the main goal of this series of electoral rallies is to provide support to Republicans in the face of difficult November elections.
President Trump’s five-corner campaign next week aims to “mobilize volunteers and supporters to help Republicans protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Congressional scrutiny is such an important point on the president’s schedule that as the hottest campaign season approaches, he will visit as many states as possible,” said Trump’s campaign spokesman, who declined to give his name.
Today's vote at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could draw supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media attention from Pittsburgh" — West Virginia Metro News.
On Saturday, Trump will visit West Virginia — a state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016 — for the second time in the past month.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Senate candidate, Republican Patrick Morrisey, who is losing in polls.
“This is not a good sign for Morrisey when the president comes in to support him in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team of the United States shows the spirit of the fight, keeping hope for victory in Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the foursome format on Saturday afternoon could have been what Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging gearshift is a completely invented sports concept, but one that the players really believe in, and most of all in competitions like these.
So what does their momentum look like at this point?
“They’ve driven six points and now they’re only driving four, so I think we have a little momentum,” Spieth said.
Europe, of course, leads by four points, while there are still twelve to be won.
Americans, Spieth says, however, feel the wind in the sails and have decent patterns to follow, especially in the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together throughout the day and each of them could boast of gaining three points out of four.
Spieth is dangerous in all areas and sets an example.
Screams all over his throat, a sign of excitement, became louder during his round, sinking a key putt and winning the match when he and Thomas scored two holes in two strokes.
His reflection on the ground, which gave them a victory of 15, met with a similar cry —one that makes it clear that the American team is still in the game.
“You just have to focus and worry about your own game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
18 holes to win.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the past two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undeniable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange but charming couple of the European team won four out of four and were not mistaken.
"Moliwood" is the only couple who did not include a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
The way the game is played and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the noisy crowd proves that you have to beat these players on Sunday, and that there is no better player than Fleetwood or Molinari who could seal the potential victory of the European team at Le Golf National.
It would be best if they played on different holes at the same time.
However, it is too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly played Sergio Garcia, a morning fourball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
Bogey and a double-double on the front nine have dug Spain and Sweden into a hole they would never get out of.
There's no one on Sunday to help get out of the hole.
The fourball and foursome formats are so fascinating because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how a change in strategy can happen in an instant.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has taken a significant lead in the last day, but the foursome session also showed that the U.S. team has a grip on the fight that some, especially in the U.S., have doubted.
Europe with a score of 10-6 includes leading on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe with a significant advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after winning 10-6 Saturday fourball and foursome matches with the United States.
The inspired duo – Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari – guessed the lot, having two victories over the struggling Tiger Woods, increasing their previous score at Le Golf National to four points.
The European team of Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the cheap American team in the morning fourball format, winning the series with a score of 3-1.
The United States put up more resistance in the foursome format, winning two games, but could not make up for the loss.
To keep the trophy, Jim Fury’s team must score eight points out of 12 singles, which will take place on Sunday.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to score four points in a row, while with Molinarim (the team was named “Molliwood” after a sensational weekend) they are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in four opener matches.
After the collapse of Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourball format in great style, they defeated the pumped Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau, achieving an even more empathetic result of 5&4.
Woods, who struggled through two Saturday games, occasionally showed a glimmer of genius, but has so far lost 19 of 29 games in fourball and foursome formats, seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not take part in the morning fourball format, returned to Henrik Stenson in the foursome format to beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2&1 in the world ranking 1 and 3 respectively.
However, not everything went according to plan for the European team on this pleasant, cool day in the field pushed south-west of Paris.
Three-time top scorer Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a benchmark for the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a decisive 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourball format and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the 4&3 in the foursome format, losing two opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has the team made a four-point loss, starting the singles, although Furyka's team would only have had a draw to retain the trophy.
However, taking second place two days ago, Sunday’s counterattack seems to be rather unlikely.
North Korea says "stand-alone no" to unilateral disarmament without confidence.
North Korea’s foreign minister said during a speech at the United Nations on Saturday that the lack of lifting sanctions only deepens North Korea’s lack of trust in the United States and there is no way that the country unilaterally renounces nuclear weapons in such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant measures of goodwill" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing to non-proliferation of weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see any concrete response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no guarantee of our national security, and under such circumstances there will be no unilateral disarmament of North Korea.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s reluctance to renege on a “gradual” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual action, his statement appeared to be significant, as he did not renege on a single point of view.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between the U.S. security chief and North Korea’s leader, which took place in Singapore on June 12, when Kim Jong Un pledged to work for “denuclearization and denuclearization” of Trump.
North Korea had expected a formal end to the Korean War (between 1950 and 1953), but the U.S. delegation announced that Pyongyang must first give up nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for the easing of harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even opposing the signing of a ‘declaration of an end to the war,’” Ri said.
“The conviction that sanctions can bring us to our knees is the grudges of people who behave ignorantly towards us.
The problem, however, is that the lack of lifting sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, which the U.S. leader spoke about earlier this week at a U.N. forum.
Instead, the minister drew attention to three meetings between Kim Jong Un and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, after which he added: “If South Korea were a party to denuclearization and not the United States, then there would be no such impasse.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was completely different compared to last year when he said during the UN General Assembly that North Korea’s missile targeting on U.S. territory is inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump misfired (Mr. Evil President Trump himself).
This year at the UN forum Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim Jong Un for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but also said there was still a lot of work to be done, and also said that until North Korea is able to defend itself against North Korea.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had not set a time limit, saying, “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue and be sustained until we establish a full, final and verified denuclearization.”
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously tightened sanctions on North Korea, trying to stifle funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside the U.N. General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month in preparation for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his latest visit cannot be called a success.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, and within hours North Korea had condemned him for "putting in gangster demands".
North Korea pledged this month at a meeting with Moon Jae-in that it would dismantle the missile test site and nuclear complex if the United States took “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim Jong Un told him that the “appropriate measures” he cares about are security guarantees Trump has pledged to ensure in Singapore and taking steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest.
The new course at Harvard University, which took place this year, provided all students with more sleep, which was aimed at combating the growing macho culture of learning by “all-night caffeine-powered students.”
Academic students from the best university in the world often have no idea about the basics of taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has developed a course that he says is the first of its kind in the United States.
To create the course, he was inspired by a speech on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
At the end of the speech, a girl came up to me and said, “Why am I being told this only now that I’m in my final year of college?”
She stated that no one ever told her about the meaning of the dream, which surprised me,” the Telegraph said.
The course, which was held for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleep-related habits help achieve good results in science and sport, as well as improve the overall well-being of students.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health service, said that this course was decided to be introduced after it was found that students suffered from a severe lack of sleep during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
One section includes a picture of the dorm room where students click on coffee cups, curtains, exercises, and books to get information about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, as well as how important it is to maintain sleep regularity.
In another section, participants learn how a long-term lack of sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
“We know that this will not cause an immediate change in the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know – just as everyone has a right to know what the health effects of smoking cigarettes are,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “all-night science” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students means a growing problem of lack of sleep.
Ensuring a sufficient amount of good quality sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, and even to avoid gaining weight because lack of sleep causes the brain to go into starvation mode, making the student constantly hungry, he said.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler develop a course after taking part in one of his classes last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push for the introduction of a course for the entire campus.
The next step according to him is to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar study program before moving on to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended that students set an alarm to remind them when to go to sleep and when to get up, as well as to be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by the screens of electronic devices and LED lighting, which can distort the circadian rhythm and lead to problems with sleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga takes care of Gerrard's team
The Rangers suffered another setback during the away game in Livingston when Dolly Menga shot his way to defeat the disassembled team of Steven Gerrard, scoring 1-0.
The Ibrox Stadium team wanted to score their first win since a 4-1 win over St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games, making an eight-point difference to the Ladbrokes Premiership leader.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half, and the Rangers team showing no commitment did not look to improve.
While the Rangers recorded a drop to sixth place, Livingston climbed to third — just behind Hibernian with the loss of one goal.
The Rangers team may have another setback due to the need to deal with the head wound of line judge Calum Spence after he was hit with an item thrown from the stands for guests.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which allowed him to overtake Ayr and advance to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, in turn, passed with the same 11th Livingston, who took a Hearts point last week, being a delightful way in which his well-trained team struggled at every step of their opponents.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but it was Livingston who did more with the ball when they got it.
They should have scored in just two minutes, when Menga's first-ever touchdown allowed Scott Pittman to face Allan McGregor's goal, but the assistant didn't take his chance.
Then Keaghan Jacobs addressed a deep free throw to Captain Craig Halkett, but his colleague Alan Lithgow playing the defensive position could only remain in the back position.
The Rangers regained control in the third quarter, but it looked like they had more hope than faith in their game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he deserved a penalty fifteen minutes before the end of the game when he and Steven Lawless fell on each other, but Judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claim.
The Rangers were only able to deliver two custom shots in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly barely worried about Lassana Coulibaly's head and Ovie Ejaria's weak shot.
While Livingston's 34-minute opening goal could have been against the course of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it for the effort put into his win.
Again, the Rangers couldn’t handle the deep, solid piece of the game made by Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher threw the ball to Scott Robinson, who remained calm, giving it to Menga for the simple completion of the action.
Gerrard did not waste a break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent – this change almost immediately affected the winger who threw the ball at Morelos, but the impressive Kelly managed to block it, running from his position.
Livingston's team continued to draw guests into the game exactly as they liked when Lithgow and Halkett performed long passes one after the other.
Holt's team could have increased the lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor made good on Jacobs, after which Lithgow removed the game from the corner.
Rangers backup Glenn Middleton was hoping for a penalty shot again when he got confused with Jacobs, but Thomson turned his eyes again.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our edition of "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882 — 136 years ago... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which eventually led to the creation of a device known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger's counter has become both an element of science and pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which these seemingly unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans performed:
Man: "What the hell is this?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that’s used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you’ll hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactive minerals.”
Evans: “You can hear something now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name has survived to this day.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "detect" the enemy cells.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to "detect" enemy cells and destroy them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize hostile cells as part of treatment.
This method consists of separating the immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
Then they can "see" the protein common to many cancers. Then they are injected back into the body.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
In one woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize hostile cells, ovarian cancer has been reported to disappear for more than 18 months.
The method consists in separating immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can “detect” a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then injecting those cells back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results indicate that the vaccine is doing very well.
HER2 “drives the growth of several types of cancers,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancers, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to locate cancer cells worked in the treatment of a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a pro-Trump diatribe on Saturday Night Live with a MAGA hat on his head.
It didn't go too well.
Kanye West was kicked out of the studio during Saturday Night Live after praising U.S. President Donald Trump and saying he would run for office in 2020.
After that night’s performance of his third song, entitled Ghost Town, during which he wore a cap with the inscription “Make America Great”, he made an argument against the Democrats and once again expressed his support for Trump.
“When I talk to white people, I hear, ‘How can you like Trump? He’s a racist!’
“If I was concerned about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL program began with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on sexual assault charges brought by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, West's video was sent to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not known if Rock wanted to make West laugh by posting a post.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had problems with his hat behind the scenes.
“They took me behind the scenes.
They told me not to go out with that hat on my head.
They've got me!
And then they say I don’t have a way out,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “You’re saying I don’t have a way out?”, adding, “I’m going to make a superman’s pilgrim so you won’t be able to tell me what to do.
Let's accept ourselves."
His words twice caused the audience to “kiss” and the members of the SNL team looked embarrassed — reports Variety. The person in the studio during these events: “The studio was in a grave silence.”
West was invited to the show in place of singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West intrigued many with the performance of I Love It in a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUS group, Candace Turner, who posted the following tweet: “To one of the most courageous: THANK YOU FOR BEING MAFFY.”
Karen Hunter, the host of the talk show, said on Twitter that West was “just being himself and it’s absolutely amazing.”
“But I will NOT reward a person (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘art’) who I think accepts and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
We are also free,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now "formally called Kanye West".
However, he is not the first artist to change his name – he follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The friendly rapper, Snoop Dogg, adopted the name Snoop Lion, and the music legend, Prince, changed the name to a symbol, then an artist previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder over stabbing at a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is scheduled to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecutor's office.
Star of the Game of Thrones Kit Harington raises the issue of toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval HBO series Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor struck a stereotype of a macho hero, saying that showing such roles on screen causes young boys to often think they have to play hard to be respected.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit stated that "something went wrong" and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones partner, 31-year-old actress Rose Leslie, has admitted that he feels "quite confident" about the matter.
“Personally, I feel pretty confident at this point — where did we make a mistake on the subject of masculinity?” he said.
“What did we teach men as they grew up, from the perspective of the problem we’re dealing with now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the development of toxic masculinity due to the portrayal of very male characters.
He continued: “What attitudes are innate and what are learned?
What do you learn on television and in the streets, what makes young boys start to think they have to stand on a certain side to be a man?
I think this is one of the most important issues of our time — what can be done to change that?
It’s clear that not everything is right with young men.”
In the interview, he also confessed that he would no longer play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series ended the following year, saying that he had "done with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will play Sam Shepard in True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers getting to know his wife Rose to be the best thing that ever happened to him in Game of Thrones.
“On the plan, I met my wife, which provided me with my future family and a new life,” he said.
In this multi-award-winning Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose played Ygritte, the object of the character’s love interest played by Kit, Jon Snow.
The couple got married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China sees 14 per cent increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected, according to the country’s health service.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases have been transmitted through sex, which means a change from the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spreads rapidly in some parts of China as a result of transfusion of infected blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been almost completely reduced, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year after year, the number of people living with HIV and suffering from AIDS in China increased by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of the HIV virus is a serious problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is widespread.
Given the country’s conservative values, research estimates that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
Many cases of transmission of the disease result from insufficient protection when having sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has provided universal access to HIV drugs as part of efforts to combat the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that one of her team members disclosed the Republican Party senators’ data — it’s “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theory.”
U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters on Saturday dismissed allegations that a member of her team had posted the personal data of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
A member of the Los Angeles-based Democratic Party said the charges were brought by experts and websites linked to "ultra-right wingers."
“Lies, lies and even more vicious lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The release reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, posted by an unknown person at the Capitol during a Senate panel hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct directed against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came some time after three senators questioned Kavanaugh's candidacy.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was linked to the Waters office and published information about a Waters team member, Hill said.
“This baseless allegation is completely false and it is a 100 percent lie,” Waters continued.
“A member of my team — whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations — was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false, and it is a hundred percent lie.”
Waters' statement quickly sparked online criticism, including from Ari Fleischer, a former White House press spokesman.
“This way of denying is wrong,” Fleischer wrote.
“It suggests that she doesn’t have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, it can’t be bad.
He can't provoke.
He must not question the motives of the person making the accusation.
For that, he must remain calm.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of showing excessive anger during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“It’s a big deal, if it’s true,” he wrote on Twitter.
In a statement, Waters said her office had notified "the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies of these fraudulent allegations."
“The perpetrators will be exposed and prosecuted for all their actions that pose a threat to any member of my team,” she said.
Johnny English: Nokaut — a spy parody with the weakened Rowan Atkinson
Searching for references to Brexit in every new British-themed film has already become the norm. This seems to apply to the new part of a series of films from the genre of action and comedy "Johnny English", which started in 2003 from the film "Johnny English" and which returned to the English cinema screens "Johnny film in 2011".
Will the self-deprecating satire about how hopeless we are become the country’s new export goods?
In any case, the ever-surprised, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny English has again received a license to share—his name, more than anything else, signals that he is an elaborate, comical piece intended for non-English-speaking viewers.
He is, of course, a stupid secret agent who, despite his strange tastes for smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Jasio Fasoli and a drop of this guy adding one note to the melody of the theme song of the Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics.
In the past, he was also a traveler and a global mystery man — Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, in which he left chaos behind.
In the latest Johnny English movie, there is one or two moments worth noting.
I really liked the scene where Johnny English approached the helicopter, dressed in medieval armor, while his helmet was rhythmically struck by the rotor blades.
The screen clearly shows Atkinson's gift for physical comedy, but the sense of humor seems to be quite low-flying and unnecessary, especially since currently also "serious" film brands, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, offer comedy elements as part of the film.
Humorous elements seem to be directed at children rather than adults — I don’t think Johnny English’s crazy adventures are as inventive and coherent as the gags in Atkinson’s silent films about Jasio Fasoli.
It has always been a valid assumption that the UK is in serious trouble.
The cyber-hacker infiltrates Britain’s top-secret spy network, revealing the identity of all British agents operating in the field — to the dismay of a serving agent, Kevin Eldon, who unfortunately played a minor role.
This is the last drop in the Prime Minister's bitter spell, which is a pompous, wasted figure already suffering from a nervous breakdown caused by a lack of political popularity: Emma Thompson does everything in her power, playing the role of Theresa May, but the script does not give her a chance to unravel.
Her advisers from the intelligence agency inform her that due to the disclosure of the identity of all active spies, she will have to return to the service of one of the retired agents.
And that means an incompetent Johnny English in his own person, currently employed as a teacher at some fancy school, giving off-the-record lessons on how to become a secret agent — a few good gags while giving a spying lesson by English.
English is called to Whitehall for check-in, reuniting with his former assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man attached to the submarine’s commander—a cheerful but somewhat tired character played by Vicki Pepperdine.
So Batman and Robin's secret service of Her Royal Highness return to action, meeting the beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova, a character played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously taken over by a charismatic tech billionaire-maniac who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems — he is the villain Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their crusade of absurd situations: dressed as waiters set fire to a French restaurant; they cause chaos by sneaking aboard a luxury Volta yacht; and English sows desolation when using a virtual reality kit to acquaint themselves with the interior of the house.
In this last sequence, any restrictions disappear, however, despite the nice and noisy performance, the whole film is very much like television for children.
Typical average.
As with other Johnny English films, I couldn’t resist the thought: can the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly matches his talent?
The Labour Party denies that it is developing a plan that provides for a four-day work week for the British people, for which they will receive a salary in five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party will consider introducing a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week, receiving a salary in five days.
The party reportedly wants the company’s bosses to pass on the savings they’ve made from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to employees, giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend with the same amount of pay.
Sources say that this idea will "fit" into the party's economic program and plans to leave the country in front of the workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was supported by the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to benefit from changing the economy.
In an interview with The Sunday Times, a senior member of the Labour Party said: “It is expected that a policy change will be announced before the end of this year.”
“It will not happen day by day, but a four-day work week is something that fits into the party’s approach to restoring economic balance for the benefit of the worker, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.
The Labour Party is not the first party to support such an idea — the Green Party has pledged to introduce a four-day work week during the 2017 election campaign.
At present, however, these plans are not supported by all members of the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day work week is not a party policy and its introduction is not considered by the party.”
John McDonnell, Chancellor of the Shadow Cabinet, used last week’s Labour Party conference to present his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from “faceless directors” and “speculators” in utility companies.
The Chancellor’s plans from the shadow cabinet also mean that current shareholders of water companies may not be able to regain their full share, as the Labour Party government could make “calculations” based on detected abuses.
He also confirmed plans to place employees on company boards and set up integrative equity funds to hand over 10 percent of the equity of private sector companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy respond in 60 Minutes to the question of whether an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh could change their attitude
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week and raised the question of whether the findings of the Bureau of Investigation could prompt Republican senators to withdraw them.
In an interview on Sunday, 60 Minutes, Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could discover anything that could lead to a change in their attitudes.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Of course,” Kennedy said.
“When I went to the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after how it happened when the charge came up, and I asked, "Did you do this?"
He was determined, determined, and clear.”
Graham’s opinion, however, seems to be carved in stone.
“I’ve made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh and to change it requires a strong charge,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“None of the people who gave it were able to verify it.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t think anything will change.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it contributed to reducing poverty to any extent?
The next Saturday in New York will be the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that boasts an impressive cast of stars and an equally impressive mission – the eradication of poverty in the world.
Taking place for the seventh time, the Global Citizen Festival will visit tens of thousands of people arriving at the Great Lawn in Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of stars such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to support the realization of the most important goal of this event, which is the liquidation of the 2030 deadline.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international group of anti-poverty activists by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to this event (unless it was decided to purchase a VIP ticket), the concert participants had to perform a number of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, sending an e-mail message to a world leader, making a phone call, or other significant actions to help increase the number of participants.
But what successes can Global Citizen boast in the perspective of the remaining 12 years to achieve the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a good way to convince them to take action, or is it another case of so-called “clictivism” when people feel they are doing something important by signing an online petition or posting on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” of people supporting the action, aiming to achieve many different goals.
It also says these actions have helped spur global leaders to announce commitments and regulations worth more than $37 billion that are expected to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, under which at least $10 billion has already been paid or funded.
The group estimates that the security measures have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, the UK’s partnership of 4 investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential” who have pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country, after they overthrew you Global members.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizen members like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a thing of the past” — Tracey Ullman, Ambassador of Power of Nutrition, at the 2018 Live Concert in London in April.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve the quality of nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional problems.
To one of the most frequently asked questions on their website, which was “How can we be sure that extreme poverty will be eradicated?”,
The global citizen responded as follows: “It will be a long and difficult road – sometimes we will stumble and fail.
But as with the previous great movements for civil rights and the fight against apartheid, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the stars at this year’s event in New York hosted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Navy to ‘Block’ Russian Energy Exports — Secretary of the Interior
Washington may “if necessary” resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering markets, including those in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke — Washington Examiner has revealed.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria — especially where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government — is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is the desire to mediate in the energy trade, as is the case in Eastern Europe,” he said.
According to the official, there are ways and means to solve this problem.
“The United States, by virtue of its navy, has the ability to ensure that sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, to create a blockade to ensure that their energy does not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at the event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that calls itself the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
He also compared Washington’s approach to Russia and Iran, noting that they are in fact the same.
“The economic option of Iran and Russia is more or less about using and replacing fuels,” he said, comparing Russia to a “single-single-single-single-single-single-single-single-single-single-single-single-single-single-singlegging economy.”
These statements came at a time when the Trump administration is continuing a mission to increase exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe — a much cheaper option for European consumers compared to Russian gas.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the implementation of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump said made Berlin a “slave” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which is designed to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a project of an economic nature only.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s ardent opposition to the project stems solely from economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September in Moscow.
The position of the United States provoked a strong reaction from Germany, which confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called on the United States not to interfere in EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I think it’s a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supplies,” Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
During a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering her candidacy.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington and fix a broken government, including a woman who holds the highest office,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will consider my candidacy for president.”
During the meeting, Warren mentioned President Donald Trump, saying he was “leading the country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren without a garden has voiced her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren voters do not think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters choosing the option “probably” said the senator should not run, according to a poll conducted by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for the candidacy of former Gov. Deval Patrick — 38 percent supported his potential candidacy, and 48 percent opposed it.
Other well-known names from the Democratic camp taken into account in relation to a potential 2020 candidacy were Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Track Palin during Donald Trump's election campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the military in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he has to go through after his return, I understand other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at Donald Trump’s election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called her son’s arrest “a taboo subject,” after which she said of her son and other war veterans: “They come back a little different, they come back hardened, they come back wondering if there will be respect for what their fellow soldiers, airmen and other members of their country will give.”
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, inciting false testimony in a domestic violence report, and possession of a weapon in a state of limbo, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the fight against a new policy regarding the granting of asylum
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support the legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the U.S. District of Columbia submitted a letter Friday in Washington to amicus curiae to support an asylum seeker struggling with the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the lawsuit in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his brutal gang sons" had abused her, but U.S. officials rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where there are a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as countries grappling with common gang problems and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 Board of Immigration Appeals decision that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney General of Colombia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be considered on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and such a prohibition violates this principle,” the letter reads.
Prosecutors further argued in the letter that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, arguing that they can become entrepreneurs and “determine the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang-related violence.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear of racial, religious, national, or social group affiliation, or who have such and not other political beliefs,” Sessions said in his June 11 statement on asylum policy.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems—even the serious ones—that people from all over the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu in a situation where the death toll has doubled in a race aimed at finding survivors
For the survivors, the situation was becoming more and more tragic.
“It’s a very intense feeling,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, comforting her feverish son at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, the ambulance brings in the body.
“There is no clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to destroyed homes, searching for water-soaked things and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals, damaged by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake, quickly overflowed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered fractures to his spine and arm, were resting outside a military hospital in Palu, where the patients were treated outside due to severe secondary shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted the violent earthquake that shook the room on the fifth floor of the hotel, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save.
I think I've been pushed into the rubble of the wall," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had come to the city for a wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, and her voice was silenced.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they are safe.”
The U.S. ambassador accuses China of “harassing” propaganda ads.
A week after an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page ad in an American newspaper praising the mutual benefits of U.S.-Chinese trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to smear it.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to a paid addendum to China Daily in the Des Moines Register — Iowa’s most popular newspaper — accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. congressional elections that will be held on November 6 — China overruled.
Trump’s allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election confirmed what U.S. officials told Reuters that this is a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place commercials promoting trade with their countries, Beijing and Washington are now escalating a trade war that has led to increased tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were supposed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported the Republican Party of Trump, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a longtime governor of Iowa — the main exporter of agricultural products to China — said Beijing had done harm to U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
Branstad stated in an article in the Sunday edition of the Des Moines Register that China “is now starting to double down on harassment by placing propaganda ads in our own free press.”
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the respected American tradition of freedom of speech and the free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
For this, there will be no objection in the kiosk on the street in Beijing, and no real reflection of the divergent opinions that the Chinese may have about the unsettling economic direction taken by China, given that the media is under the strong control of the Chinese Communist Party.
He added that “one of the most famous Chinese newspapers refused to publish” his article, though he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans infuriate women with voting rights ahead of midterm elections over Kavanaugh affair, analysts warn
While many leading Republicans are backing and arming Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of several allegations of sexual assault, the analyst warns that these members will meet during the upcoming midterm elections with a sharp reaction, especially from women.
The emotions associated with this event are extremely high, and most Republicans already officially want to vote.
“This cannot be reversed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at the University of Syracuse.
Reeher said he had doubts whether Senator Jeff Flake’s (Arizona) last-minute effort to investigate by the FBI was enough to appease angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday — they won’t forget it tomorrow and they won’t forget it until November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan “November is coming,” demonstrating in the Senate Hall because of the Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee’s decision not to withdraw Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
“The level of democratic enthusiasm and motivation will go beyond the scale,” said Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst.
“People say he was tall anyway — and that’s true.
But it may be higher, especially among indecisive suburban women and younger voters between the ages of 18 and 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony, in which she detailed her allegations of sexual assault addressed to the Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if Republicans had decided to approve the candidacy, it could have met with a violent reaction.
“The Republican Party has to deal with a lot of mess,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will be elected, it’s also about the way the Republicans handled the situation and how they treated Ford,” said Guy Cecil, director of US Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem to be a little divided as to who to believe in the face of Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, with the latter having a little more support.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly or rather believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they strongly or rather believed Kavanaugh’s testimony.
In addition, 38% of respondents said that Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied when testifying, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI has launched an investigation into the allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified last week under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her under the influence of alcohol at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals while attending Yale University in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet in order to compete with Google and Facebook platforms.
Tim Berners-Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology legend, Inrupt, is a company based on the open source platform – Solid – owned by Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to specific information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of creating Inrupt was “dominance of the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said, referring to the startup.
"The historic moment has come."
The application uses Solid platform technology to enable people to create their own “online store with personal data” or otherwise POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify available in one browser at the same time.
A unique feature of an online store with personal data is that it completely depends on the user who has access to what information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to the company’s president, John Bruce, Inrupt’s idea is to provide resources, processes and the right skills to help make the Solid platform available to all people.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world have been able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to make a complete change that will cause them to turn their business models upside down from day to day.
“Don’t ask them for permission.”
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to deliver commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new network built on the Solid platform.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has done a lot in the debate about net neutrality.
Inrupt Berners-Lee is the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely excited to be thinking about the next era in network development,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the award of the clerical Cross of Victoria during the First World War
The memory of the only clergyman of the Church of England, who was awarded the Victoria Cross as a combatant during the First World War, was celebrated 100 years later in his hometown.
Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded on 29 September 1918 for his attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, never finding out that he had been awarded the highest British military order.
On Saturday, his two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vann, said the unveiling of the stone on the 100th anniversary of his grandfather’s death was “extremely symbolic.”
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Canal Saint-Quentin "in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from the field and machine guns".
He then rushed to the line of fire and, with "the greatest courage", led it forward, after which he single-handedly attacked the position of the field troops, eliminating three of them.
Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I would never be able to cope with, but at the same time something humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, took the crown at the end of a parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt "very honoured to be able to take part in the parade" and added that "the courage of a true hero is manifested in the support he receives from many people."
MMA fans didn’t sleep all night to watch the Bellator 206 gala, instead getting Peppa Pig.
Imagine that you didn’t sleep all night to watch the emotion-packed Bellator 206 gala and finally not be able to see the main fight.
The San Jose gali program featured 13 fights, including six on the main map, and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to fight, viewers in the UK were shocked by the change to the Peppa Pig program.
Some were disappointed after not sleeping until the early hours of the morning, especially to see this fight.
One fan on Twitter described the change to a children’s cartoon as “a sick joke.”
“Under the government’s regulation, content of this kind is inappropriate to be released at 6 a.m., so a change to the children’s program was necessary,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
Peppa Pig, yes.
Bellator’s president, Scott Coker, said they would be working on a schedule to include viewers from the UK in the future.
“When I think about a repeat of the situation, I think we’ll be able to fix it,” Coker said.
“But it is Sunday the sixth morning, so we will not be able to deal with it until Sunday according to our time, and Monday according to their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when there was a change in the program, we were filled with a lot of comments, none of which sounded friendly.
We tried to fix it... we thought it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn’t just a legal issue.
I can promise you that this situation will never happen again.
We will limit the program to five fights instead of six — that is, to the standard amount. We wanted to please the fans too much and unfortunately we over-improved.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘worse’ because of sexuality
Tom Daley, an Olympic water jumper, says he grew up feeling worse than everyone else because of his sexuality, but this gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn’t realize that not everyone was like him until he went to high school.
On Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 hosted by Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others “hope.”
He also said that being a parent made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular host of this long-running show, Kirsty Young, took a few months off due to illness.
Appearing on Laverne’s first-ever show, Daley said that as he grew up, he felt “less valuable” than others because “the simultaneous liking of boys and girls was not socially acceptable.”
He said: “To this day, this feeling of inferiority and being different is something that gives me the strength to succeed.”
He said he wanted to prove that he is “worth something” so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally find out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist became a vocal LGBT activist and used his performance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he decided to express himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly, without any implications, and wanted to give others “hope” in this way.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man — the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 — “surprised him.”
Daley married an Oscar winner (who is 20 years his senior) last year, noting that such a age difference was never a problem for him.
“When you’re going through so much at such a young age” — he meant his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father’s death from cancer three years later — he said he found it difficult to find someone at the same age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents to a boy named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June. Daley said that his perception of certain things has completely changed.
“Last year, the most important thing for me was to win a gold medal,” he said.
“And you know what? There are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
“My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked if they already had tickets to the 2012 Olympics in London — he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘You’re not going to be with us to be in the front row, Dad,’” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing. It was only when he stopped breathing and died that I realized that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won bronze.
“I knew that this was what I had been dreaming of all my life — jumping into the water in front of a crowd of people at the Olympics — it was the best feeling I could have,” he said.
This also inspired him to choose the first song — Proud by Heather Small — which accompanied him in his preparations for the Olympic Games and which continues to spice him up with goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Demonstrating Mickelson's lack of form on the bench during Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to work on his form so she doesn’t miss her mark.
Mickelson, who plays for the twelfth time in the event every two years, was sent back to the bench by Captain Jim Fury for Saturday's fourball and foursome games.
Instead of being in the center of the action, as was often the case in his case with the United States team, the five-time main winner had to spend the day doping the team and working to improve his game in the hope of fixing the cause of his referral to the bench.
The 48-year-old, who has never hit the easiest shots, even at the peak of his career, doesn’t do very well on the tight Le Golf National field, where mishits are mercilessly punished by long roughs.
And if the field itself isn’t discouraging enough for Mickelson, in the ninth game on Sunday, he must face the precision of British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who joined forces with debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches.
If the Americans (with a loss of four points at the beginning of 12 singles) start the game with a win, Mickelson’s game may prove to be extremely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his player — he could not have done anything else.
“He fully understood his role today, patted me on the back, held me by the hand and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He is very confident.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has brought a lot to play for his teams both in the past and this week.
I didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought there'd be more, but that's how it went, and that's how we had to do it.
He wants to play like everyone else all the time.”
Mickelson broke Nick Faldo's record for the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This may mean the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never matched his individual achievements.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws on his account. Furyk said that his presence has brought a lot to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, ridiculous, and it’s good to have him in the band room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players had a good time with him this week, which was nice to see.
He brings a lot more to his person than just a game.”
European team captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a big point advantage could soon shrink
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a significant point advantage before the start of the singles on the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a difficult game.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in a match at Valderrama, where, along with his accompanying vice-captain Sevem Ballesteros, he had a five-point advantage over the Americans, but missed the finish line by the shortest possible hair, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>1.
“We can’t forget that we had a big advantage in the Valderrama field; we also had a big advantage in the Brookline field, where we lost, and in the case of the Valderrama field we only won by hair,” Bjorn said, in the photo, after winning the 5-3 Class of 2018 on both Friday and the 10th of October.
Time will tell me and everyone on the team that this is not the end.
Tomorrow you will do your best.
Go out there and do everything right.
The end will be only when the points appear on the board.
We have a goal to win the trophy, and we need to focus on that.
I said from the beginning that I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we also know very well who the people on the other side are – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with how his players handled the difficult field, added: “I couldn’t have done it better.
Tomorrow, however, is different.
Tomorrow, the singles begin, and that’s another matter.
It’s good to play with your partner when everything goes according to plan, but when you’re playing alone, your golfing skills are tested to the limit.
This is a message that you have to give to the players, to give everything tomorrow.
Your partner has to do everything too.”
Jim Furyk, unlike Bjorn, will expect his players to score better on their own than when playing with a partner, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself experienced major stock returns on the final day, being a member of the winning team at Brookline Field, after which he suffered a defeat after the European team performed a "miracle on the Medinah Field".
“I remember every word,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, warmed up to his players’ fight on the final day.
“Tomorrow we’re playing 12 important matches — you’d like to start the game at a fast pace, as happened on the Brookline and Medinah fields.
If this drive goes in one direction, it will put a lot of pressure on the midfield matches.
We set our squad accordingly and set the boys in a way that would allow us to be enchanted tomorrow.”
Thomas was tasked with leading the counterattack, pitting Rory McIlroy in the main game, as well as Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter — other European team players in the top half of the program.
"I've decided on this group of guys in that order because I think he's going to be able to handle it throughout the game," Bjorn said of his singles choices.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
The latest frigate of the German Navy should be put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the Cold War, but this will not happen until at least next year due to faulty arrangements and rising costs — as the local media reported.
The deployment of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the main ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate, was postponed to the first half of 2019, the newspaper Die Zeit reported, citing a military spokesman.
The ship should be included in the Navy in 2014, but due to problems that arose after delivery, it was necessary to introduce changes in this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class units ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
Of course, they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as technological solutions that prevent detection, ensuring, among other things, the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic traces.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance – the operation of new frigates should be possible even for two years away from home ports.
“Continuous delays mean, however, that these modern warships, which are intended to enable Germany to respond to situations abroad, will be obsolete by the time the service begins,” Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate appeared on the front pages of newspapers last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the reversal, but the German media reported a number of key "software and hardware faults" that made the ship useless in a combat mission.
Particularly significant were the software flaws, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships are to be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, which is half as much as the older Bremen class frigates.
It also turned out that the ship is much too heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the Navy to carry out future modernizations.
The 7000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is believed to be twice as heavy as similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project — including crew training — also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), while the initial cost was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the use of new frigates are of particular importance in the light of recent warnings that the strength of the German naval fleet is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, admitted that the sailors were “ending up ships capable of use”.
He also said that this problem has increased over time as a result of the withdrawal of old units from operation without providing replacement ships.
In addition, he expressed his dissatisfaction with the fact that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class could be included in the Navy fleet.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret life of bats
New research carried out on the property in the Scottish Highlands aims to show how bats use the landscape when gaining food.
The results of the studies are expected to shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future action to protect them.
The study, conducted by researchers from the National Trust for Scotland, will target common and small dwarfs, as well as long-eared brown bats and bats from the red-night family at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
In key locations around the property, special recorders will be deployed to keep track of bat activity throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out field research using portable detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recordings is aimed at determining the frequency of signals sent by bats and the way in which individual species behave.
Then a habitat map and report will be developed to create a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor at NTS, hopes the findings will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best ways to maintain forest areas for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the past century.
They are at risk from construction and development works that have an impact on the fences and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting installations can also pose a threat, as can fly adhesives and some chemicals used in building materials, and even domestic cats.
Bats aren't really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more helpful than their eyes in catching prey.
They use a complex echolocation technique to search for worms and obstacles on their way.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It consists of ten trained experts who regularly conduct examinations, checks of the herd, and sometimes even rescue actions.
The organisation has even established Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve on the Threeve estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says it is the perfect territory for bats.
“Threave has a great area for bats,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and great settlements.
However, there are still many unknowns when it comes to bats. The work we do here and in other estates will help us better understand what they need to develop."
He stresses the importance of controls for the presence of bats before embarking on maintenance work on the estates, since unintentional destruction of one rod can kill up to 400 females and young, which can lead to the disappearance of the entire local population.
Bats are under protection—killing, harassing, or disturbing them, as well as destroying their nests is illegal.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish officer at the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and in many species we don’t even know how their populations are doing.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges While His Lawyers Are Going to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape charges against him as “fake news”, saying that people “want to promote themselves” using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published these allegations.
A Portuguese Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
According to Der Spiegel, the footballer was supposed to pay a woman $375,000 for silence.
Ronaldo, 33, described the reports as “fake news” in a live Instagram post to his 142 million followers.
“No, no, no, no, no.
Today’s reports are fake news,” said a five-time Golden Ball winner.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
Nothing new.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but that's part of my job.
I’m happy and everything is fine,” the footballer added with a smile on his face.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel magazine over allegations they have called “inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy protection” — according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for “moral damages in the amount of the corresponding amount of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.”
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the footballer’s room, where he allegedly raped the woman anal — according to documents filed in the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was “99 percent a good guy” who was visited by that “one percent.”
According to the documentation, Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sex, but this was done with mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photographs of her injuries were taken at the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was “fearing of retaliation” and “public humiliation.”
The 34-year-old says she wants to cancel the deal now because she still can’t forget the alleged incident.
At the time of the alleged attack, Ronaldo moved from Manchester United to Real Madrid, and this summer he moved to Juventus after paying <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million for him.
Brexit: UK 'would regret all the time' the departure of car manufacturers
Britain “would regret it forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after leaving the European Union, Business Minister Greg Clark said.
He added that he was “concerned” when a Toyota UK representative told the BBC in an interview that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal, production at a factory in Burnaston near Derby would be temporarily halted.
"We need an agreement," Clark said.
A spokesman for the Japanese automaker said the effects of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to a reduction in jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“In my opinion, if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal at the end of March, then there will be a halt to production at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers fear leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade works, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW plans to close its Mini car factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns are, as car manufacturers claim, the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal.
Toyota’s production line operates on a “just-in-time” basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be difficulties at the border, which industry representatives say could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
According to a company representative, Toyota would not be able to last more than one day without deliveries to its factory in Derbyshire, so production would be halted.
Clark said Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU was "precisely designed to avoid border controls".
"We want to reach the best possible agreement, which will not only allow us to enjoy the current success, but also allow us to take advantage of this situation properly," he told BBC Radio 4.
“The statements not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers indicate that we need to be able to continue what was a very efficient set of supply chains.”
Toyota’s representative was unable to say how long production would be halted, but warned that in the longer term additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness, leading to a reduction in employment.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and is a member of the union’s works council, said union members are becoming increasingly concerned: “I know from experience that if jobs are eliminated, they will never be restored.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the European Union.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
An important meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be "delayed for another week" due to the ongoing fight over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, who investigates the possibility of Russian interference in elections, the links between Trump’s close associates and Russia, and the potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thereby threatening Mueller’s independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was talking about wearing a wiretap to record conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of removing the president from office under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these reports.
Last Monday, however, he went to the White House in the face of reports that he was about to resign.
The date of the meeting with Trump, who was then at the UN headquarters in New York, was set for Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein. There was a postponement of the meeting to avoid colluding with the hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee, during which testimony was made by Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual abuse, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “No date has yet been set for this meeting, it may take place this week, or it may be postponed for another week, taking into account all the events related to the Supreme Court.
We’ll see, I’m sure I’ll tell the press about it.”
Several journalists have questioned this statement: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Chris Wallace, who runs the program, asked why.
Sanders said a small number of press conferences were not caused by the reluctance of “obsessive” television journalists, adding: “I will not hide that they are “obsessive.”
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The current president conducts more ‘questions and answers’ sessions than any other president before him,” she said, adding without providing evidence: “We’ve gotten to know the numbers.”
Press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if journalists have the opportunity to directly ask the president of the United States questions, it’s a much better solution than talking to me.
We try to do this on a regular basis, and in the last few weeks we have done it very often. Press conferences will give way to such sessions, during which you will be able to talk directly with the President of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Solo press conferences are a rarity.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why he is so, behaving too freely and sometimes strangely in front of the assembled journalists.
The Minister of Health writes to employees from the European Union countries employed at NHS Scotland in the face of concerns about Brexit
The Minister of Health has written a letter to employees from the European Union countries employed in the Scottish health service to express their gratitude from the country and ask them not to leave for Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the European Union.
The Scottish government has already committed to cover the costs of examining applications for ‘settled status’ for EU citizens working in decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “Negotiations on the UK’s exit from the European Union continued in the summer and appropriate decisions will be taken in the autumn of this year.
The British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this is a very troubling time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of his or her nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and enhance the work of the health service and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie undergoes surgery for head injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's match with the Vanderbilt Commodores, which ended in the Tennessee team's 31-27 defeat, Mike Organ said.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the player suffered an injury shortly before the end of the first half.
“He went to the sideline, and then he sunk to the ground,” Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline, then put him on stretchers and lifted him up for further testing.
A Tennessee State representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “there are no details yet on the type/size of the injury,” and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie (a second-year student fired from representing the university for a year to train his skills) is playing his first season with the Tennessee State team after transferring from Illinois.
On Saturday before the game ended, he had five games, giving him 18 games throughout the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher tax rate when buying a property in the UK.
In accordance with the new plans of tory buyers from abroad will be charged higher tax fees for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom. The funds obtained in this way will be used for homeless assistance.
This move is intended to downplay Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract a young electorate.
The tax increase will include people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury Department predicts it will receive as much as <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that a higher fee will be charged to foreigners buying real estate in the UK, and the additional funds obtained in this way will be used to help the homeless.
This move is seen as an attempt to downplay Jeremy Corbyn’s efforts to attract a young electorate with promises of cheaper housing and to increase the burden on more earners.
Higher tax rates will be imposed on individuals and non-taxing businesses in the UK. Additional measures are to help the government fight homelessness.
The additional fee — charged in addition to the current tax rate, including the two-yearly higher rates for second homes and apartments purchased for rent — can be as high as three percent.
The Treasury expects that this move will bring in as much as <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by residents of other countries, which leads to higher prices and makes it difficult to buy a first home or apartment.
Because many foreigners buy real estate and spend most of their time abroad, many of the rich regions —especially the capital— have turned into “spirit cities.”
The new rules come just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a tax cut to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large developers of maintaining high real estate prices by occupying the land but not using it. He also called on Prime Minister May to lift the limits of cheap housing in order to eliminate the “housing scandal” in the UK.
Jeremy Corbyn announced a number of attractive housing reforms, including rent regulation and the end of the eviction “for no reason.”
It also wants to give local governments greater powers to build new homes.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that as Prime Minister I was committed to rebuilding the British dream of a better life for every generation than the previous one.
This also means the repair of our troubled housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not right that people who do not live here, as well as foreign companies, can buy real estate here with the same ease as hard-working British residents.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has become very distant, and the humiliation of having to spend the night on the street is all the more real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest ambition is to become a Scottish national’
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says his “biggest ambition” is to become Scotland’s coach at some point.
This forty-two-year-old Scotsman is working hard to heal the North-East club, which is currently in third place in League One with a three-point loss to the best team.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after bringing St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only managed to get to B," Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“As a child, I often watched the Scottish game at Hampden with my father, and it always attracted me.
However, such an opportunity will come only if I succeed as the club’s coach.”
Ross’ predecessors as Sunderland coach included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O’Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic coach says he doesn’t feel intimidated by taking on the role of such famous personalities in such a big club, having previously rejected proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success will be measured for me now by whether I can bring this club back into the Premier League.
Given its structure and the facilities it has, there is no doubt its place,” he adds.
“It will not be easy to do this, but I will probably feel that I have succeeded here, only if I succeed.”
Ross’s coaching career has only lasted three years, before he was an assistant coach at Dumbarton and for 15 months he was part of the Hearts coaching team.
He then helped Alloa advance again after downgrading to the third league, and the following season he led the St Mirren team from the edge of the drop to the championship title.
Jack Ross says he now feels much more comfortable than when he played in Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real turning point,” Alloa said in a statement.
“I really believed that running a team was much better for me than playing.
It sounds strange, because as a player I managed, I made good money and I achieved some measurable successes.
However, playing is a heavy piece of bread.
Every week you have to go through different situations.
They still meet me when it comes to the stress and pressure associated with the coach’s job, but I feel good in that role.
I’ve always wanted to train others and now I’m doing it. I can say that right now I feel the most in place in my entire adult life.”

Studies show that the best time to have a beer is at 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heatwave caused a surge of customers to flock to British pubs, but it was reflected in restaurant chains.
Studies have shown that in July, sales in pubs and bars increased by 2.7 percent, but in restaurants they fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the CGA consulting firm, which developed the data, says: “Continuously hot and longer than expected England’s participation in the World Championships caused the results in July to be similar to those in June, when pub turnovers increased by 2.8 per cent, with a further drop in restaurants.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June was even greater in July.
The pubs and bars offering drinks fared the best — their sales growth exceeded the drop seen in restaurants.
Pubs serving food also suffered during the heat, though not as much as restaurant owners.
It seems that people were just thirsty.
Beverage sales in managed pubs and bars rose 6.6 percent this month, and food sales fell three percent.
Paul Newman of RSM, which analyses the entertainment and tourism industry, said: “These results are in line with the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The most important factors affecting the amount of consumption 'outside the house' remain the weather and major sporting or social events.
The fact that restaurant chains are going through tough times is not surprising, though a 4.8 percent drop in sales compared to the previous year will have particularly dire consequences if you take into account continued pressure to cut costs.
The long and hot summer has come at the least favorable moment for the owners of the premises serving food and the weather will show whether the slightly more moderate temperatures we had in August will bring the much-needed respite.”
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including those newly opened, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand development.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which monitors sales in the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector, collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion. It sets recognised industry standards.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
Research has shown that one in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students of secondary schools showed an increase in the number of “fake Insta” pages
This news has exacerbated fears that there is sexual content published on them.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” account that they show to their parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — set up social media accounts that they don’t disclose to adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in the number of fake Insta accounts — the name refers to Instagram, where you can share photos.
This news has raised concerns that these accounts are used to publish content of a sexual nature.
Twenty percent of students admitted that they have a “main” account, which they show to their parents, and they also have private accounts.
One of the mothers who happened to stumble upon the secret site of her 13-year-old daughter met a teenager who urged others to “rape her.”
A study conducted in independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters" and Headmistresses" Conference (HMC) found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 have two profiles, half of whom admit to keeping private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, president of HMC, said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are creating places on the internet where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle to be ‘Sportsman’s Voice’ at Scottish Athletics
At the annual general meeting of the management of Scottish Athletics, Eilidh Doyle was elected to the board as non-executive director.
Eilidh Doyle is Scotland’s most highly regarded athlete, and President Ian Beattie has described this move as an excellent opportunity for those who manage the sport to benefit from her rich international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh has great respect in the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that introducing her to the board will bring great benefits to Scottish athletics,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m very pleased to be able to pass on the athletes’ voice to the council, and I hope I can really help manage the sport in Scotland.”
An American who, among his four Olympic gold medals, has won 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and now regularly appears on the BBC as an expert, cannot walk as a result of a transient anemia.
He wrote on Twitter: “I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time will tell if I will recover and to what extent.
It was a pain in the ass, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again and went back to training!
Thank you for all the words of support!”
The advertising of lactators, which compares mothers to cows, arouses extreme emotions on the Internet
The company that makes lactators has caused a storm on the Internet, publishing an ad that compares breast-feeding mothers to breast-fed cows.
To announce the launch of the world’s first “silent lactator to wear under clothes,” its manufacturer, Elvie, has released a mock-up ad in the form of a video that highlights the freedom it provides mothers.
It depicts four real mothers dancing in a haystack to a song that says, "Yes, I'm getting wet, but I can't see the tail" and "If you don't notice, it's not just my tits."
And the refrain goes like this: “Pump them up, pump them up, feed the children, pump them up, pump them up, breastfeed my masters.”
The ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked controversy on the internet.
The film currently has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments. Users express extreme opinions, many of them saying that it is inappropriate to joke about the “horror” that takes place in the dairy industry.
“Using cows to advertise this product was a very bad idea.
Like humans, in order to give milk, they have to get pregnant and give birth to a calf, with their babies being taken away from them a few days after birth,” one user wrote.
Elvie's Lactator Can Be Undetected Under Breastfeeding Bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another person commented: “This is obviously traumatic for both the mother and the child.
Sure, let’s use cows to advertise lactation for mothers who can stop their children.”
Someone else added: “This ad is completely detached from reality.”
Others gun the clip — one woman said the song was “fun” in her opinion.
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I was still breast-feeding, I would buy one.
When I was eating, I felt like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I don't find a second bottom in it.
“It’s a great invention,” someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a fun ad for mothers who pull away food (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It is not intended to praise or criticize the dairy industry.”
At the end of the film, it turns out that women danced with lactators discreetly attached to the chest.
The campaign was inspired by the view that many breastfeeding women feel like cows.
However, Elvie’s lactator is completely silent, has no cables or tubes, and can be worn unnoticed under the bra for feeding, giving women the freedom to move, hold children in their hands, and even walk out of the house while pulling food off.
Ana Balarin, a partner and creative director at Mother, said: “Elvie’s lactator is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative premiere.
Comparing feeding women and dairy cows, we wanted to show all the challenges associated with food withdrawal, while presenting in a fun and consistent way the incredible sense of freedom that it provides.
This is not the first time Elvie's lactation has hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, during Marty Jakubowski’s show, a mother of two with this product attached appeared on the runway.
Hundreds of migrant children have been smuggled into a tent camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained immigrant children is growing rapidly, although the number of people crossing the border does not actually change every month. This is due in part to the fact that the harsh rhetoric and rules introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Most sponsors are also usually undocumented immigrants who are afraid of exposure to deportation if they apply for a child.
That risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that fingerprints would be taken from potential sponsors and other adults living on the joint farm, which would then be handed over to immigration officials.
Last week, senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Matthew Albence testified before Congress that his agency had already arrested dozens of people who had signed up as sponsors for children left unattended.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had not been previously listed.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who are sponsors or live with them on a single household stay in the country illegally, and a large proportion of them are foreigners with a criminal past.
That is why we are constantly chasing them,” said Albence.
Asylum workers say that as part of efforts to speed up the regulation of the situation of children, officials have introduced new rules that require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention — not after 60 days, as was the case under previous standards.
Much will be done through videoconferencing, not in person, to ask an immigration judge to legalize their status.
Those who do not qualify for release will be immediately deported.
According to shelter staff and reports that have been published in recent months, the longer children are in detention, the easier they can become restless or depressed, which in turn can lead to outbreaks of aggression or attempts to escape.
Defenders said these problems are even more serious for larger centers, such as Tornillo, where because of its size, it is easier to ignore signals that something bad is happening to the child.
They also added that moving children to a tent camp without providing them with adequate time for emotional preparation or saying goodbye to friends can exacerbate the trauma that many of them are already dealing with.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
During his address to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouale also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are staying on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and "we will deal with them accordingly."
“They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem says the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions forced to flee their homes since 2011.
He says Damascus will continue to "conduct its holy battle until the cleansing of the territory of Syria" from both terrorist groups and "all foreigners staying on it illegally."
Currently, about 2,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Syria, mainly training Kurdish and Syrian forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad and advising them.
In addition, there are more than 1000 French soldiers in the country destroyed by the war.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were good enough for them to return, and accused “some Western countries” of “inciting irrational fear” that discourages them from returning.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations for help in these returns,” he said.
“They politicize things that should have a purely human dimension.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that until President Assad opposes a political agreement to end the war, Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid.
U.N. diplomats say the latest agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity for political talks to continue.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has helped prevent a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a province of three million people.
Moualem stressed, however, that the deal has a “clear timeframe” and expressed hope that military action will be directed against jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Lewandowski People’s Defense Front, who will be “eliminated.”
The UN envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to convene the first meetings of a new commission composed of members of the ruling party and opposition soon in order to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and prepare for the elections.
Moualem outlined the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the commission, saying the panel's work should be limited to "verifying the provisions of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win the Election Again
According to this logic, President Trump would be elected for a second term in 2020 unless, as many liberal observers hope, his presidency ends with an early removal from office and a scandal.
It would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of the presidency so far”.
So far, there are no signs of fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, CNN’s primetime viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million viewers, and MSNBC’s viewership has nearly tripled to 1.6 million viewers.
According to Nielsen Fox News, it attracts an average of 2.4 million viewers in its highest viewing hours, an increase from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show has achieved the highest results among cable TV, attracting as many as 3.5 million viewers.
“People are flying like lightning — that’s something we don’t understand,” Neal Bear, the lead producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” said of the cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol attack.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She remembers driving a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“It makes me laugh,” he replied.
“Chaos has entertainment value.”
Of course, reports from Washington could, like nothing else shown on television, judge the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the permissibility of connecting immigrant families, or the state of the world economy.
Exclusion is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
Besides, it’s not just a matter of being a well-informed citizen when you watch a panel of experts debating Bob Woodward’s use of secret informants while writing the book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s jacket from the skin of an ostrich for $15,000 (“clothes overwhelm”) or The Post.
I’ll never look at Super Mario like I used to.
“What he’s doing is in part reminiscent of the reality show in that it delivers new content every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the changing cast and daily returns of the Trump show (such as an attack on NFL players, Dz or Chwal).
You can't afford to miss the episode because you're going to be left behind.
When I met Mike Fleisse this week, the weather on the north coast of the island of Kauai, where he has his home, was beautiful, but he was sitting in the middle watching MSNBC and filming CNN at the same time.
He couldn’t move away from that, not when Brett Kavanaugh was standing before the Senate Judiciary Committee and weighing the future of the Supreme Court.
“I remember doing all these crazy programs before, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought they were joking, but it turns out they were right.”

Inflow of money from the outside for the election campaign to Congress
It is not surprising that after the reorganization of the electoral districts, as a result of which in the race for one position will now be two current official congressmen, the 17th electoral district in Pennsylvania flows a river of cash.
This newly formed suburban Pittsburgh district is represented in Congress by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district during last spring’s special election.
Lamb competes with another current congressman, Republican Keith Rothfuss, currently representing the former 12th District in Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th District.
The county maps were corrected after a January ruling by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which ruled that the old counties were designated unfairly, which gave an advantage to Republicans and was inconsistent with the constitution.
The race in the new 17th district began with a campaign funding battle between the party’s main funding bodies, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamba's name gained popularity in Pennsylvania after winning a landslide victory in a widely publicized election to the 18th Circuit in March.
A Republican has been in this position for more than a decade, and Donald Trump has won the district by 20 points.
The political experts gave the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States has considered punishing El Salvador for supporting China, but has withdrawn from the idea.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, despite Washington’s slight opposition.
In June 2017, President Donald Trump held a cordial meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, and until the expulsion of the partners of the Trump Organization management team had a hotel in Panama.
State Department officials have decided to call off the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over "recent decisions to cease recognition of Taiwan," according to a statement released by the department's spokesman, Heather Nauert.
However, the sanctions under consideration were only to be imposed on El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million in aid from the United States in 2017, including aid to combat drugs and support development and the economy.
The proposed sanctions, which were to include restrictions on financial aid and the granting of visas to certain individuals, would be very painful for this Central American country, which is facing high unemployment and a high murder rate.
As international meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference on security and economic well-being to deal with the conclusions of a similar meeting last year, which was seen as a step forward.
In mid-September, top-level administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, thus making any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Diplomats say that now at the conference, which is currently scheduled for mid-October, Vice President Mike Pence is to speak, which is supposed to be a signal to invite representatives of the administration to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, accompanying no new harsh messages or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman, John Bolton, declined to comment on the details of the debate, which were presented by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on condition of anonymity.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst from the administration's environment, who also spoke anonymously.
Learn History
Another element may be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the possible obstruction of justice by President Trump, which is currently publicly available with concrete evidence.
According to reports, Robert Mueller’s investigation is also investigating whether Donald Trump’s campaign had anything to do with Russia’s attack on the U.S. election.
If the composition of Congress changes, President Trump will be held accountable as he prepares to speak again before voters, and perhaps even be tried before a jury.
There are a lot of unknowns here, and I don’t want to suggest that Trump’s downfall — or anyone on his equal footing in Europe — is inevitable.
All of us on both sides of the Atlantic must make a choice that will decide how long it will take.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if only the West would resist him and support Czechoslovakia in Munich.
This failed and we lost the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The tracks of history revolve around such turning points, speeding up or slowing down the inevitable course of democracy.
There are now several such turning points in front of the Americans.
What will we do if Donald Trump sacks Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man on whom the future of Robert Mueller’s investigation depends?
Rosenstein has been in trouble since we revealed in our paper that last year he proposed a secret recording of the president and speculated that he was not fit for office.
According to Rosenstein, the report presented by The Times is inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s newly-ordered investigation into Brett Kavanaugh turns out to be incomplete or unfair, or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we elect to Congress in the middle of the presidential term the people who will hold Donald Trump accountable?
If we do not go through these trials, there will be difficult times for democracy.
However, I believe that we will succeed — because of the lesson I received in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassador's residence.
She survived, she emigrated to America, and 60 years later she sent me to light the shabbat candles on that swastika table.
Having such a legacy, how could I not look to the future optimistically?”

The Rangers player, Graham Dorrans, is optimistic about the match with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that a win with the Austrians, won after an impressive draw with Villareal reached this month in Spain, will significantly increase their chances of qualifying for the Group G of the Europa League.
Until the 2:2 draw with Villareal, injury to the knee prevented assistant Graham Dorrans from playing this season, but he believes that this result will affect the Rangers as a springboard to greater success.
“We did well because Villarreal is in good shape,” the 31-year-old said.
“We went to this game with the belief that we would achieve something — and we won the point.
Perhaps in the end we could still press them, but in general the draw is probably a fair result.
The Spaniards were probably better in the first half, but in the second we were better.
As for Thursday, it is another important evening for Europe.
We hope that we will be able to get three points, but this match will be difficult, because our opponent got a good result in his last match. However, I am sure that thanks to the support of the fans we will pass and this and we will win a positive result.
“The last year has been very difficult because of everything that has to do with my injury and the changes at the club itself, but now we all feel good in our seats.
The team is great and the boys really like to play. The training is going well.
I hope we can go on, leave the last season behind and be successful.”
The fear of retirement savings spends women's sleep from the age of
Although the survey participants knew exactly how they wanted to be taken care of, few talked about it with their families.
In a survey conducted by Nationwide, about half of the participants said they talked to their spouse about the costs of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t talk about it,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide Life Insurance.
Where to start?
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not prepare the family to take care of you if you do not express your will beforehand.
Together with your counselor and family, discuss where and how you want to be looked after, as this choice will be an important factor in determining costs.
Ask a financial advisor for help: He can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care funds can come from a traditional policy for such care, a hybrid policy that allows you to withdraw cash to cover such expenses, or from your own assets — as long as you own it.
Prepare legal documents: You will avoid these court battles.
Designate a trusted health care representative who will supervise it and ensure that the appropriate persons act in accordance with your will if communication becomes impossible.
Also consider hiring an attorney who will handle the finances.
Choose a trusted person, because they will make financial decisions for you and make sure that all the bills are paid if you are not able to do it yourself.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent suddenly needs medical help and is just going to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write down all the information so you can have it ready.
“It’s not just about finances, it’s about who the doctors are,” Martin asks.
“What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
It’s worth having such a plan at hand.”
Man repeatedly shot from a windmill in Ilfracombe
The man was repeatedly shot from the windshield as he was returning home from an evening party.
The 40-year-old was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place at around 02:30 BST, as “accidental.”
The victim did not see the assailant.
The injuries reported do not threaten the life of the man. The police ask to report witnesses of the incident.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
According to official reports, at least 384 people died as a result of a powerful earthquake and tsunami that visited the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday. The number of victims is likely to increase.
Due to broken communication, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala cabupaten, which is located north of Palu, closer to the earthquake's epicenter by a force of 7.5 degrees.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some of the most important information about Palu and Donggala kabupatenie on the island of Celebes:
Palu is the capital of Central Celebes, a province located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island. According to estimates, in 2017 there were 379,800 people living there.
When there was an earthquake and a tsunami, the city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of its founding.
Donggala is a kabupaten (administrative unit lower than the province) stretching along the northwest coast of the island for more than 300 km.
It is estimated that in 2017 it was inhabited by 299,200 people.
The main branches of the Central Celebes economy are fishing and agriculture, which have developed especially in the coastal donggal kabupatene.
Another source of income for the province are nickel mines, but they are mainly located in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Celebes.
According to the Indonesian Agency for the Elimination of the Effects of Disasters, during the last 100 years earthquakes and tsunamis have visited Palu and Donggala several times.
In 1938, a tsunami that struck Donggala killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, nine people were killed in a tsunami in western Donggali.
Indonesia is located on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire, so earthquakes occur there quite regularly.
The biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake that hit the western coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coast, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: At the end of March and the beginning of April, the western coast of Sumatra was visited by a series of strong earthquakes.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: In the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, there was a 6.8-magnitude earthquake, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra, there was a 7.6-magnitude earthquake.
As a result, more than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off the coast of Sumatra, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters in height that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A flat earth quake struck Pidie Jaya in Aceh province, causing havoc and panic among people who still remembered the devastation caused by the devastating 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami wave, but the fighting buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: Large earthquakes have visited the tourist island of Indonesia, Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mainly on its northern side.
They caused the destruction of thousands of houses and caused temporary trouble for thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report published Saturday by Alaska State Troopers, a 29-year-old man from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on domestic violence charges, making it difficult to file a complaint and resisting arrest.
According to a police report, when a friend of the suspect tried to call the police to give notice of the crime, he took her phone.
KTUU station reports that Palin is under investigation by Mat-Su and has a security deposit of $500.
According to her, last Saturday he stood in court, where in his defense speech he stated that he was "certainly innocent".
There are three Class A offenses in Palina, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B felony, for which he faces a prison day penalty and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Then his mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Veterans’ Claims Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the filing of a complaint, and possession of a weapon in a state of emergency in connection with the incident.
His partner says he punched her in the face.
In 2016, groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin, who linked her son’s aggressive behavior to the post-traumatic stress disorder he acquired while serving in Iraq.
Hundreds of people have died as a result of a tsunami after an earthquake in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died as a result of Friday’s earthquake that hit the Indonesian island of Celebes.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and connectivity are not working and the number of victims is expected to increase in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred near the central part of the island of Celebes, which is located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
There are videos on social media showing the moment of disaster.
When the tsunami hit the coast, on the beach in Palu, where the festival was held, there were hundreds of people.
Federal prosecutors are demanding the death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are demanding the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, a suspect in the New York terror attack that killed eight people. This is a rare punishment — it has not been carried out in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
To carry out the attack, which took place in October on a bike path running along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, 30-year-old Saipov allegedly used the rented Home Depot truck, which he set off pedestrians and cyclists on his way.
According to a notification filed in the southern New York district of the intention to demand the death penalty in order to justify its necessity, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm.
According to the court document, both of these charges are punishable by death.
A few weeks after the attack, the federal jury presented Saipov with an indictment of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder in connection with illegal activity — a procedure commonly used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases — and a charge of motor vehicle violence and murder.
According to prosecutors, the organization of the attack required "solid planning and reflection". The way Saipov carried it out was described as "monstrous, cruel and immoral".
“Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov brought harm, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erli, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejand Damian Pa.”
Five of the victims were citizens of Argentina, who were staying in New York on holiday.
The last time the death penalty was imposed in the Southern District of New York was ten years ago.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but eventually received a life sentence in September 2009.
The death penalty as a result of the federal case was last carried out in New York in 1953 on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. The marriage was lost after two years before they were found guilty of conspiracy and espionage in favor of the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were killed in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, who comes from Uzbekistan, within months of the attack did not show any remorse.
Police say he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov confessed to authorities that he was inspired by ISIS videos that he watched on his phone.
According to the police, he also demanded the hanging of the ISIS flag in his hospital room.
To the indictment, which includes 22 charges, he replies that he is innocent.
David Patton, one of the federal defense attorneys representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty and reject life without the possibility of early release after being convicted will prolong only the suffering that these events have brought on all concerned,” he said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to demand the death penalty.
Tories MP says NIGEL FARAGE should take responsibility for Brexit negotiations
During today's protest, which took place during the Tory conference, Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the army of the people".
A former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians must “feel the heat” from eurosceptics when one of Theresa May’s MPs suggested he should take responsibility for negotiations with the European Union.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that if Farage had been Brexit secretary, “the UK would already be out of the Union.”
However, the inclusion of the Tories opting to remain in the community in a separate protest against Brexit, which was taking place in the city, further highlighted the burden of reconciling its deeply divided ranks, which stands before Theresa May.
Your Prime Minister is trying hard to implement his plan of compromise with Chequers amid attacks by Brexit supporters, his opponents, and the European Union itself.
Its allies claim that despite opposition, it will seek to conclude a deal with Brussels and force Eurosceptics and Labour to make a choice between its proposal and “chaos”.
Peter Bone told the Leave Means Leave meeting in Solihull that he wanted to “throw the plan out of Chequers.”
He suggested that the representative should be Nigel Farage, who should be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If it was him, we would be out of the Union by now,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I support Brexit, but we have to throw the plan out of Chequers.”
Presenting his opposition to the European Union, he said: “This is not why we fought in world wars to be subject to someone now.
We want to establish our rights in our own country.”
Peter Bone rejected suggestions that citizens have changed their mind since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their mind and want to stay in the Union is completely untrue.”
The demonstration also featured Brexit supporter Andrea Jenkyns from the Tory party, who told reporters: “I’m just saying: Madam Prime Minister, please listen to the people.
The Chequers plan does not enjoy the support of the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, neither will our party nor our activists, who populate the streets and who elected us, nor do they support it.
Please drop the Chequers plan and start listening.”
In a statement to Prime Minister May, she added: “Premiers keep their positions when they keep their promises.”
Nigel Farage said politicians taking part in the demonstration must “feel hot” if they were to betray the decision taken in a 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us — the people — and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re here today to tell them we’re not going to let you do that.”
Addressing a cheering crowd, he added: “I want you to make politicians who are on the verge of Brexit betrayal feel hot.
“We are mobilizing the army of the people of this country that gave us victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent, independent, proud United Kingdom.”
During this time, opponents of Brexit marched through the city to the center, where a two-hour demonstration took place.
A handful of activists waved “Torys against Brexit” banners after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour activist, Baron Andrew Adonis, laughed at the Conservatives over the security problems of the party app at the start of the conference.
“These are the people who say they can organize IT systems and all the technology to support the Canada Plus plan, a smooth border, free trade without borders with Ireland,” he added.
"It's a complete farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Elizabeth Warren plans to ‘seriously consider’ running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously consider running for president” after the November election.
As reported by The Boston Globe, the representative of the Democrats from Massachusetts spoke about her future during a meeting with voters that took place on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Elizabeth Warren, who often criticizes President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November, and her opponent will be Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts during the 2016 election.
It is now said that in the 2020 election, Warren could defeat Trump.
Saturday’s event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the city hall since Donald Trump took office.
One of the participants asked if he planned to run for president.
Elizabeth Warren responded that the time had come for “women to go to Washington to repair our broken government — and she also means the woman at the top.”
Arrest of the shooter of the fatal shooting in which the player of the team of LSU, Wayde Sims died
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on Saturday reported the arrest of a suspect in the Friday shooting that killed LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department reported the arrest of 20-year-old Dytheon Simpson during a conference that took place at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time.
On Friday, a video of the shooting was published with a request for help in identifying the man visible on it.
Twenty-year-old Wayde Sims was killed in a shooting near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head with a firearm, resulting in his death,” Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told 247sports.
Wayde stood up in defense of a friend and was shot by the Simpsons.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being at the scene of the crime, carrying a gun and shooting at Wayde.
After his arrest, during which he did not resist, he was taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Measuring 1.98 m junior Wayde Sims grew up in Baton Rouge. He played in 32 games, with the last season he started 10 times, during which he spent an average of 17.4 minutes on the floor, gained 5.6 points and scored 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team’s command allowed him to win with Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that the Mercedes team’s order would have a big impact on the race result.
Bottas, who started from the first field, started very well and almost defeated Hamilton, defending his position in the first two laps and forcing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went down to the service point first and allowed Hamilton to ride in the peloton's tail, which should decide the fate of the race.
The Mercedes driver went down to boxing in the next lap and appeared behind Vettel, but after a wheel-to-wheel action, as a result of which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inner part of the track, risking being pushed into the defensive after a double movement of the rival, aiming to defend the position third behind.
Max Verstappen started at the end of the bet and on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round he was in seventh place.
He then drove through much of the race because he didn’t change tyres to make a quick finish and take fourth place for Kimi Raikkonen.
In the end, he reached the service point at the 44th lap, but in the remaining eight laps he was no longer able to accelerate.
“It was a tough day because Valtteri was doing a great job all weekend and he was a real gentleman when he was told to let me in.
The whole team did their best to take the first two places,” Hamilton said.
It was really bad body language
During the meeting, which took place on Saturday, President Donald Trump spoke with Senator Dianna Feinstein, who maintained that she did not disclose the contents of a letter from Christina Blasey Ford, in which she accuses Supreme Court-nominated Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony of Christina Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Instead, he stated that what happened in the Senate showed that people are “wicked, mean and lying.”
“What could have happened is one thing, but this beautiful situation in the Senate, which we have been witnessing for a few days, when we see anger, when we see people who are angry, mean, mean and lying,” he said.
“We see what’s been published and revealed, and then they tell us, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.’
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianna Feinstein, did you reveal that?
Remember her answer... did you reveal the contents of this document? — oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn’t reveal it.”
Wait, wait, wait.
Did we reveal...No, we didn’t disclose,” he added, exasperating the senator.
Dianna Feinstein received a letter from Christina Ford describing the allegations against Kavanaugh in July, and his contents leaked in early September. Your senator denies that the source of the leak was her office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s insinuation, I didn’t reveal her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked for my discretion and I did not disclose this content at her request.”
However, her statement did not convince the president, who commented on it during Saturday’s meeting: “I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of a candidate for the Supreme Court judge, whom three women have accused of sexual harassment, the president suggested that Democrats use insinuations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to seize power by any means necessary.
You see the meanness, the meanness, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to destroy in order to take power and control,” the president said, according to reports on the Mediaite website.
Elite League: Dundee Stars — Belfast Giants 5:3
In the match with Dundee club Patrick Dwyer won two goals for the Giants
Dundee Stars have made up their fifth Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants, winning a rematch at home 5:3 on Saturday.
The Giants quickly gained a two-goal advantage after the shots of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized the score, after which Dwyer again led the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised the score again, scoring for Dundee, after which two goals scored by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen sealed her victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League season for Adam Keefe, who despite an initial loss on Friday night won with Dundee in Belfast 2:1.
Both teams met for the fourth time this season — the first three games won by the Giants.
Dwyer's opening goal fell in the fourth minute (3:35) after Kendall McFaul's assist. Four minutes later Beauvillier doubled the score thanks to David Rutherford's assist.
After an intense opening at 13:10, Sullivan brought the hosts back into the game, and then Matt Marquardt equalized the score at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead before the first break when he scored his second goal that evening at the end of the first third.
The hosts' team was regrouped and Bouchard again equalized the score with a goal scored during the game in the lead at 27:37.
At the end of the second third, Cownie and Charles Corcoran helped Nielsen secure Dundee's first advantage in this match. Dundee's final victory was sealed in the middle of the last third by the same player who scored the fifth goal for his team.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next game at Milton Keynes on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies, helping hundreds of people on the plane escape from an earthquake
An air traffic controller from Indonesia was hailed as a hero after he died, helping the plane safely take off with hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have died and many have been identified as missing after a major earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Celebes on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
There are still strong secondary shocks in the area. In the city of Palu, many people have been trapped in rubble.
Although his colleagues fled to save his life, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the tower of flight control at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there to make sure that the Batik Air aircraft (flight number 6321), which was just on the runway, took off safely.
Then he jumped out of the tower when it seemed to him that they were about to collapse.
He died in the hospital.
According to reports on the Australian station ABC News, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said that the controller's decision likely saved the lives of hundreds of people.
We organized a helicopter from the city of Balikpapan to Borneo to move it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, Anthonius left this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“This news has broken our hearts,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands. The national disaster relief agency informs that the ability to reach the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“We believe that the death toll is still increasing because many of the bodies are still under the rubble and cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
The six-meter-long tsunami wave destroyed Palu, where a mass funeral of the victims will be held on Sunday.
Military and civilian aircraft provide assistance and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Ambulances are constantly importing bodies.
There is a shortage of drinking water.
“Small shops are looted.”
Jan Gelfand, head of Indonesia’s International Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a hurry to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’ll come up with.
It’s a tragedy, and it could be worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said: “I ask all of you to work day and night to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?” reported CNN.
This year Indonesia has already witnessed an earthquake that killed more than 550 people on the island of Lombok.
A plane crash in Micronesia — Air Niugini lines report that one person is missing after the plane crashed into a lagoon
Airlines operating the flight, which crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific, report that one person is missing. Previously, they claimed that all 47 passengers and crew members were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said it could not account for one man travelling on a feral plane on Saturday afternoon.
They said they, along with local authorities, hospitals and investigators, are trying to find him.
However, they did not immediately respond to requests for additional details regarding the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
After the plane struck the water during an attempt to land at the airport on Chuuk Island, local boats helped rescue the remaining passengers and crew members.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said there were still six passengers in the hospital on Saturday, all in a stable condition.
It is not clear what the cause of the disaster was, and the exact course of the disaster is unknown.
Airlines and the U.S. Navy say the plane landed in a lagoon near the runway.
According to some witnesses, he fell off the leash.
An American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was approaching very low.
“It helped us a lot,” he said.
Jaynes said he and others managed to get through the water reaching the belt to exit the crash-landing plane.
According to him, the crew members panicked and screamed, and he himself suffered a harmless head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that the rescue operation was also helped by sailors who worked nearby on the modernization of the coast. With the help of a inflatable boat, they managed to transport people to the shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
According to data from the Aviation Safety Network database, 111 people have been killed in the last two decades in the disasters of aircraft belonging to airlines registered in Papua New Guinea. However, among these airlines, there is no Air Niugini.
The analyst reconstructed the events of the night when the woman was burned alive
On Saturday, the U.S. Attorney’s Office completed the presentation of evidence in a retrial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for many hours as a forensic expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the judges how he used cell phone records to recreate the route of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, from the night she died.
As reported by the Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett said he obtained location data from various mobile phones that showed that Tellis was with Chambers on a feral evening, thus overturning his earlier claims.
When the data confirmed that at the time Quinton was supposed to be with his friend, Michael Sanford, his cell phone was with Jessica Chambers, police decided to question Sanford.
On Saturday, Sanford testified that he was not in town that day.
When asked by prosecutors if Tellis was telling the truth, saying he was in Sanford’s truck that night, he replied that he was “lying because my truck was in Nashville at the time.”
Another inaccuracy is Tellis' claim that he had known Chambers for about two weeks.
Cell phone records showed they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after her death, Chambers Tellis removed her contact details, as well as text messages and calls from her phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
The final defense speech is set to begin on Sunday.
The judge said that probably on the same day the case will be handed over to the jury.
The High Breed – What is conscious hip-hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to change the negative image of the genre, filling their music with a positive message.
According to The High Breed of Bristol, today's hip-hop has moved away from the original political content and social issues.
The members of the band want to return to its roots and restore the popularity of conscious hip-hop.
Thanks to the work of artists such as Akala and Lowkey, the revival of artists such as The Fugees and Common has recently been observed in the UK.
Another black one?!
Nanny from New York sues couple for release after 'racist' text messages
The New York-based nanny is suing the couple for firing her from a racist job after receiving a misaddressed text message in which the child’s mother complains that she is “another black person.”
The couple denies that they were racists, comparing the lawsuit to “scantation.”
The mother of two children, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, was clearly confounded when it turned out that the new babysitter, Giselle Maurice, who had become pregnant on her first day at work in 2016, was black.
“NIEEE, A GREAT BLACK PERSON,” she wrote in a text message to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to him, by mistake, she sent it to Mrs. Maurice twice.
According to reports in the New York Post, when Plasco-Flaxman realized what she had done, she “strangely” fired Gisella Maurice, claiming that a warm-hearted nanny, who is African-American, was performing her duties poorly, and also expected Filipani from her.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for the day’s work and was then sent home by Uber.
She is now being asked to pay a pair of redundancy benefits of $350 a day, multiplied by six months, for which she was originally hired to live with, although she did not sign the contract.
“I want to show them that you don’t do things like that,” she told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple denies the allegations of racism, claiming that the termination of cooperation with Ms. Maurice was justified because after they insulted her, they feared that they would not be able to trust her.
“My wife sent her something she wasn’t going to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“Would you entrust your children to the person you have hurt, even if it was by mistake?
Your new-born child?
Come on, come on.
Comparing the lawsuit to “scantation,” Plasco said his wife was born just two months earlier and was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to blow something like that?
It’s not very nice,” added the investment banker.
Although the court case is not over yet, the public opinion quickly issued a few verdicts on social media, criticizing it for its behavior and way of thinking.
A new letter reveals that publishers of Paddington books feared that readers would not feel connected to the speaking mission.
The author’s daughter, Michael Bond, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s warm reception, says of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of the person who first read it before the book was published.
It’s very funny now that we already know what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
She claims that her father, who before the little plush bear inspired him to write a children's book, worked as a cameraman at the BBC, was sure that his work would be rejected. She also adds that after his death last year, the 60th anniversary of the book's release seems "sweet and bitter".
About Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” she says her father was secretly proud of his success.
"He was a quiet man, he didn't brag," he added.
“But because Paddington seemed very real to him, it was almost as if you had a child who achieved something — you’re proud of him, even if it’s not your fault.
I think Paddington's success was seen in more or less that way.
Although he invented and created it himself, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly and said it was really bad, that it probably wouldn’t work out,” says Tanya Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then he called to say that Natasha would be dead in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her.
I did it anyway.
I said, "Tashi, I love you very much.
I'll be at your place soon.
I'll be at your place.
The drugs that doctors gave her to maintain the action of the heart, slowly stopped working and were expelled from the body.
She had died some time before, and that was the end of it all.
I could only sit and wait with the awareness that it was all developing.
I couldn’t scream or cry because I was among other people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Tanya Ednan-Laperouse, who had already mourned the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers, unaware of the pain she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had my head down and my tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but on the plane, I felt an all-encompassing sympathy for Nada.
I felt that he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Postcards from women in mourning to help prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women, whose loved ones committed suicide, try to distract others from their intention to take their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys put postcards on the Welsh Bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers under which people can get help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he fell ill with depression, and at the age of 18 he took his own life.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I feel every day,” she says.
45-year-old Sharon Davis, who lives in Lydney, says her son was a promising cook with an infectious smile.
“Everyone knew his smile.
They always said he could light up any room with it.”
Before his death, however, he quit his job because he was “in a really black place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s brother was 11 years old and it was he who found his brother when he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm still afraid of the domino effect."
Sharon Davis created the cards, “to tell people that there are people you can turn to and talk to, even if it’s just a friend.
Don’t sit in silence, talk to someone.”
Kelly Humphreys, who has been friends with Sharon Davies for years, soon after her mother’s death, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark.
“He didn’t say anything about feeling stuck, sad or anything,” he says.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
At Christmas he was already in a complete hole. When the children opened the presents, he even looked at them."
He says that his death was very painful for them, but they had to deal with it: “It digs a hole in the family.
It's distracting us.
But we must continue to live and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI launches investigation
“I thought that if we could actually get what he asked for — a limited-time and limited-range investigation — maybe we could achieve some unanimity,” Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission would “break up” into opposing camps.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
All their reluctance comes from the moment.
Congressional elections are just a few weeks away — November 6th. If, according to forecasts, Republicans lose them, the chances of electing a certain person to the highest court in the country will significantly decrease.
George W. Bush has already lifted the headset to call the senators and urge them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was the president’s personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI makes a report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will have a vote.
Not sure if Brett Kavanaugh will get at least 50 senators' votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the impasse and bring him to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim’s rule, the number of North Korean refugees is falling.
According to the South Korean legislator, since Kim Jong Un took power seven years ago, the number of people fleeing from North Korea to South has fallen.
Citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Union, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 escapes last year, and 2,706 in 2011.
According to him, the key factors that have influenced this situation are more accurate border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates levied by human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not issued a public statement on the matter.
The vast majority of refugees from North Korea are eventually proposed to be South Korean citizens.
According to Seoul authorities, since the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea, making it easier to cross than the strictly protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers refugees to be illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forcibly sends them back to the country.
Relations between the North and the South, which are theoretically still at war, have clearly improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang, where they held talks on negotiations on denuclearization, which had previously come to a dead end.
This happened after the historic meeting of the President of the United States, Donald Trump, with Kim Jong Un, which took place in June in Singapore. The result of this meeting is a general agreement on the pursuit of the purification of the Korean Peninsula with nuclear weapons.
On Saturday, North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong-ho, accused the United States of failing to make progress on the issue.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under these circumstances there is no way we can unilaterally disarm ourselves first,” Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a “hysterical” and says he’s not fit to work in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a “hysterical” and said he was by nature unfit to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks during an interview she gave Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
“I think that if a woman behaved this way, she would be considered ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to the testimony Kavanaugh made to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations of alleged sexual harassment of Dr. Christina Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
For moments during his pre-speech speech, Kavanaugh showed strong emotions — he almost screamed and lost his speech when discussing family matters and high school years.
He also clearly chastised Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him a "grotesque and coordinated attack on reputation" organized by liberals angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's testimony showed he was not fit to serve on the Supreme Court because it revealed his bias against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself by making these statements, as well as by the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Asked if she would seek Kavanaugh’s removal from office if he received the nomination and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“If he doesn’t tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he should not only sit on the Supreme Court, but also serve in the court where he currently works,” she said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the District Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she fears Kavanaugh's possible rulings on the Affordable Care Act or the Roe v. Wade trial because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearing, Kavanaugh evaded questions about whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court’s rulings.
"This is not the time to bring a hysterical, prejudiced person into court who will expect us to say 'it's wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to own it.
It's proper diatribe, months and years of raging fury, and she can't throw it away without crying.
“We cry when we’re angry,” Gloria Steinem told me 45 years later.
“That’s pretty common, isn’t it?”
She added: “A woman who was a manager at a company helped me a lot. She said she also cries when she’s angry, but she came up with a way that when she gets nervous and starts crying, she talks to the person she’s talking to ‘You probably think I’m sad because I’m sad.
I'm angry.'
And he's still doing his thing.
I thought it was brilliant.”
Tears are permissible as an outburst of anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of one of the first jobs in a male-dominated office is how one day I started to cry with unspeakable rage. An elderly woman — a cool driver, who I was always a little afraid of — caught me in the act of squealing.
“Never let them see you cry,” she said.
“They don’t know you’re angry.
They think you're sad, and they're glad you're gone."
Patricia Schroeder of the Democratic Party, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was caught with a lover on a boat called Monkey Business and retired from the race, frustrated to the limits Patricia realized that she could actually consider the idea of running for president on her own.
“It wasn’t a deliberate decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates for the election and the last thing they needed was another one.
Someone has described this situation as ‘The Snow Queen and the Seven Dwarfs’.
As the campaign has been going on for a long time, Schroeder has been lagging behind in raising funds and has vowed not to enter the race if he does not raise $2 million.
It was a battle doomed to lose.
She then discovered that some of her supporters, who gave men $1,000, only had $250 for her.
“Do they think I have any discounts?” she wondered.
In a speech in which she announced that she would not run a formal campaign, she was so filled with emotions — gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so hard to raise money and turn to voters, not delegates, and anger at sex.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” the press reports.
“You might think I’m sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember wondering what they would write on my gravestone.
"She was crying?"
What benefits can the economic war between the United States and China bring to Beijing?
The salvos that started the economic war between the US and China were deafening and although the battle is still ongoing, in the long run, the conflict between these countries may be beneficial to Beijing, experts say.
The first warning this year was fired by U.S. President Donald Trump, imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation came this week after the introduction of new tariffs on $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods, which resulted in the taxation of half of all goods coming into the U.S. from China.
Each time Beijing reciprocated in nature, recently raising tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion from five to ten percent.
China is determined to respond to any U.S. strike, and it doesn’t look like the world’s second-largest economy is about to give up.
Forcing Washington to withdraw means accepting demands, but publicly bowing one’s head to the United States would be too embarrassing for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
According to experts, however, if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure from the US trade war could strengthen China in the long run, reducing the ties between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision taken in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for unleashing economic chaos in any of the countries is actually much more dangerous than what observers have previously conceded,” said Abigail Grace, an American think tank researcher at the New Security Center.
Foreign Minister Says Syria Is 'Ready' to Repatriate Refugees
The government says Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees, and is asking for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
In his speech to the UN General Assembly, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
“The situation on our territory is now more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
In an effort to restore normalcy, the government is constantly rebuilding areas destroyed by terrorists.
All the conditions have already been met so that refugees who have had to leave the country because of terrorism and unilateral economic moves aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods can voluntarily return to it.
According to UN estimates, since the beginning of the war in 2011, more than 5.5 million people have left Syria.
Another six million people who still live there need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would be happy to accept help in rebuilding the destroyed country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept aid protected by conditions or offered by countries that sponsored the rebellion.
Europe secures victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, beating the U.S. team 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National in the suburbs of Paris.
On European soil, the United States has lost for the sixth time in a row and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the trophy when, under the leadership of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, it scored 14.5 points, which were needed to defeat the US.
The American star, Phil Mickelson, who did not fare well through most of the tournament, hit the ball from the base straight into the water at the 16th hole of PAR3, giving the match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shined through all the rounds and became one of four players who, since 1979, when this tournament was held for the first time in the current format, managed to get a score of 5-0-0.
American Jordan Spieth was eliminated 5&4 by the lowest ranked player from Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
Dustin Johnson, who holds the highest position in the world ranking, lost two holes to Ian Poulter, for whom it may have been the last Ryder Cup tournament.
The European with the most victories in the Ryder Cup was the Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who took part in eight such tournaments and earned 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t stop today.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful to Thomas for believing in me and choosing me.
I am very happy to have the cup back.
It’s a success for the whole team and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said after the team’s victory in Europe.
He passes the baton to his countryman, John Rahm, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud of winning with Tiger Woods. I grew up watching his game,” said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods has lost all matches in France and now has 13-21-3 results in Ryder Cup.
This is an unprecedented statistic, as one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 most important titles and only conceded to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had trouble finding a treadmill all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played at a really high level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of the American squad, his captain, Jim Furyk, said: “I’m proud of the guys, they fought.
At some point this morning we pressed a few Europeans.
We've withdrawn.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
Together with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission, we will find a way to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
I am full of admiration for my opponents.
They played a lot better than us.”
Flowering information — in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota the density of plankton decreases
The latest report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows an overall decline in plankton density in some parts of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, the presence of pstrokata has been reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, suggesting that its density is decreasing.
It extends over a length of about 209 kilometres of coastline, from the north of Pinellas County to the south of Lee County.
The blooms can be found about 16 kilometres off the coast of Hillsborough County, but compared to the previous week in fewer places.
The bloom was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, the average concentration of plankton was recorded on the coast and in the waters of Le Pinellas County, low to medium on the coast of Hillsborough County, natural to high on Manatee County, natural to high on the coast and in the waters of Sarasota County, natural to high on the high on County County, and natural to high on the county.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties, cases of respiratory irritation continue to be reported.
Last week, however, they were not recorded in northwestern Florida.
