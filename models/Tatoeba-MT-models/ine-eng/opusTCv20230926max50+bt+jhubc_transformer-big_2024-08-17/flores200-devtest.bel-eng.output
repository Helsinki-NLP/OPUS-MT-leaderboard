This not only confirms the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides information that usually cannot be obtained by studying fossils, such as the color and three-dimensional spatial arrangement of feathers.
Scientists say that the feather of this animal was brownish-brown on top and had a pale or red-yellow hue on the opposite side.
This discovery allows us to better understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Due to the fact that the dinosaur feather does not have a well-developed stem — the rickshaw, but has other features of the feather — the moustache and the beard, the researchers concluded that the rickshaw was probably a later evolutionary change compared to the other rickshaws.
Assuming by the structure of the feather you can come to the conclusion that it was not used for flight, but rather to regulate the temperature or pay attention to itself. The researchers allowed that even the opposite because it was the tail of a young dinosaur, on the patterns you can see no feathers to shoot.
The researchers suggest that, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the patterns can be seen in the plumage of an adult animal, not the plumage of a bird.

In the urine samples of domestic animals that died after eating contaminated feed, both citric acid and melamine were found.
Researchers from the university said that these two compounds react with each other and form crystals that can block the function of the kidneys.
When melanin and cyanide were added to cat urine, the researchers observed the formation of crystals.
According to the results of infrared spectral analysis, the structure and composition of these crystals are similar to the structures and composition of those found in the urine of the affected animals.
I don't know if you understand this or not, but most of the goods delivered to this country from Central America are not subject to duties.
At the same time, eighty percent of our goods in Central America were taxed.
It seemed to me to be pointless and, ultimately, unfair.
I always tell people — you treat us the same way we treat you.

Adekoya has been in the Sheriff's Court in Edinburgh ever since, as she is accused of murdering her son.
She waits for the prosecution and the court, being in custody. But, given that her photos have been published a lot, any statements of the eyewitnesses can be questioned.
In other regions of the UK, this is an extended practice, but in Scotland justice works differently — the courts believe that the publication of photographs can potentially prove harmful.
“Journalists seem to go the dangerous way when they publish photos, etc. of the suspects,” notes Professor Pamela Ferguson.

Yesterday, Martel took the oath of office of a new Provisional Electoral Council, which includes nine members.
This is Martinez's fifth election in four years.
The Presidential Commission last month recommended the temporary dissolution of the Temporary Council on Elections as one of the many measures to prepare the country for the new elections.
To the large anti-regime protests that began in October, Marteli responded to the commission.
The reason for the protests, which were sometimes violent and violent, was the lack of elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
There were about 60 cases of overheating of defective ipods. This led to the occurrence of six fires, and four people received minor burns.

The memory of the moon was also honored by her fellow wrestlers.
“The moon was the first queen extreme. My first manager. She passed away on the night of two months. This is quite original, as she herself. The moon was a strong woman,” said Tony Drimer.
Dustin “Goldast” Rannells remarked: “That moon was still a stranger, no less than me ... and maybe even more ... I love her and I will miss her ... I want to believe that she is in the best place now.”
The number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008 (according to a survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election).
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Julia Gillard, acting prime minister, said she believed that at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, Australia should become a republic.
This opinion is shared by 34 percent of survey participants. They want Queen Elizabeth II to become the last Australian monarch.
The most radical views were expressed by 29 percent of respondents who believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and another 31 percent who, on the contrary, hold the view that this should never happen.
It was expected that the gold medalist of the Olympic Games would swim 100 and 200 meters in freestyle and take part in three relays during the Commonwealth Games, but his physical form causes doubts: he complained quite a lot about the state of health.

He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) says that, thanks to the NextGen system, aircraft will be able to fly on shorter routes, which will help save millions of liters of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It, in contrast to the old ground-based radars, uses satellite technology, which allows the air traffic controller to determine the location of aircraft with greater accuracy and give the pilot more accurate information.
The amount of transport does not increase, and the ground trains will not stop at "Wembley", moreover, at the ground level there is no parking for cars, as well as parking-overtaking.
The probability of forced play behind closed doors without the team's goalkeepers has increased, as it may well be that the means of transport are not enough.
About the formation of a new species of birds in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands is written in the study, which was published on Thursday in the journal Science.
According to the report of the researchers of the Prinstani University (USA) and the University of Uppsala (Sweden), the evolution of a new species has occurred in only two generations, although it was previously assumed that this process requires much more time. The emergence of a new species
You can cast different shapes from gold. It can be rolled into thin sheets.
You can pull it into a thin wire, which is then no problem to twist and braid. You can also unscrew it or roll it into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to the second metal. It could be so thin that from time to time with its help decorated the illustrations depicted in the books — the so-called "enlightened manuscripts".
This is called the pH level of a certain chemical. You can make such an acid-base indicator from the juice of red cabbage yourself.
The color of the cabbage juice varies depending on the level of acidity or viscosity of a certain substance.
The pH level in the test chemical is determined on the basis of the number of hydrogen ions (the letter "N" in pH).
Hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (as is known, the hydrogen atom contains one proton and one electron).
Move these two dry powders in a circle until they come together into a single whole, and then make a ball out of them with wet hands.
Lying on your hands reacts with external layers, which creates a strange feeling. At the same time, a kind of shell is formed.
Almost every house in the cities of Harapa and Mahenjo-Dara was able to find a washbasin, which joined the complex sewage system.
In the houses of the Greek cities of Crete and Santarina, which belong to the Minoan period, were found the remains of sewage systems.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In the Roman Empire, toilets were sometimes installed in public baths, in which women and men were together.
You're using a satellite when you're calling someone who's thousands of miles away.
In space, the satellite receives a call, after which it almost instantly reflects it back.
The rocket was used to send the satellite into space. Scientists are told to use telescopes in space, because due to the impact of the Earth's atmosphere, the light breaks and the picture turns out.
In order for a telescope or satellite to enter space, a massive rocket of more than 100 feet in height is required.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. Easier and faster movement is the biggest thing that the wheel has done for us.
Thanks to him, we had trains, cars, and many other means of transport.
Below are the medium-sized cats. Their prey is also medium-sized — they are hunted both on cowards and on an antelope with deer.
In addition, many small cats (including free-range domesticated cats) hunt and eat more small-scale prey — insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is that everyone occupies their niche, i.e. has only its own function, and therefore it does not need to compete with other cats.
Lions are one of the most friendly cats: they live in large flocks, which are known as passageways.
The passage can include up to three adult males who are relatives, as well as up to thirty females and children.
In most cases, females are close relatives, forming a large family with sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lion walkers and flocks of wolves or dogs is very similar in many ways. The latter can strongly resemble lions (but not the second large cats) in that they pose a mortal danger to the prey.
The tiger is able to climb (but not so well), jump over long distances, swim and pull with strength five times stronger than a strong person, as a well-trained athlete.
The tiger belongs to the same group with lions, leopards and jaguars (from panther). No other cat, except these four, can not scream.
A tiger's roar is more like a tale made up of sharp and loud words than a lion's roar.
Acelots are used as food for small animals. If there is such a possibility, they catch monkeys, rodents, snakes and birds. Almost all the animals on which it smokes are much smaller than acelots.
According to scientists, acelots are hunted and found by smell, smelling traces on the ground.
Thanks to the night vision, they can see well in the dark and move very confidently. They burn acelots, merging with the environment and from the hiding place attacking their prey.
If a small group of living things (a small population) is cut off from the main population from which they come (say, when moved through a cancer or mountain massif or if such living things migrate to a new island, so that it will be quite difficult for them to return), they will not budge.
In this new environment, other resources and competitors, so in order to become a strong competitor, a new population will need other features or adaptations compared to those it had previously.
The original population has not changed at all: as before, it still needs to adapt.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the animals are increasingly reminiscent of the main population from which they separated.
Thousands or even millions of years will pass and sooner or later the two populations mentioned will look so different that no one will think to refer them to the same species.
This process we call reproduction, which actually means the emergence of new species. Reproduction is an inevitable result and a very important stage of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people breathe. They, in addition to this, consume the carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants “prepare” themselves food from sunlight through photosynthesis. In addition, they give shade.
We build houses from plants and make clothes from them. We eat mostly plants. And animals would not survive without plants either.
For a time, the masaurus were outlaws, so they were not afraid of anything and no one except other masauruses.
Its long jaws were adorned with over 70 sharp teeth, and at the top of the mouth was another additional tip. This meant that its extraction would not be able to be saved.
It is not known exactly, however, it is possible that he had a split tongue. The diet of the masaurians consisted of large fish, sock and other masaurians. It is likely that they could also be used in food and representatives of their species.
On the other hand, he threw himself at everything that happened in the water; his pitch was not worth even such a giant as Tyrannosaurus rex.
Despite the fact that their food mainly would not cause us any surprises, separate dishes were, to put it mildly, unusual. Among them – wild boars, turkeys, snails and one of the rodents, known as peas.
Another difference was that when the poor and women ate while sitting on chairs, the rich used to cook the banquets on which they ate and at the same time rested.
The dishes that were prepared in ancient Rome could not include products that arrived in Europe from the Americas or Asia later.
They had, in particular, no potatoes, no tomatoes, no corn, no cocoa. It should be added that no ancient Roman ever had the opportunity to ask a turkey.
To each of their gods the inhabitants of Babylon built a main temple, which was considered his house.
The faithful offered sacrifices to their gods, and the priests tried to meet their needs, honoring them with various festivals and ceremonies.
In each temple there was an inner courtyard and a shrine, where only priests could visit.
In some cases, during the construction of temples, special towers, similar to the pyramids, were erected. They were known as zikurats.
The top of the tower was a special shrine dedicated to God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house did not matter much.
For the most part, the life of the Jewish family was spent in the fresh air.
The women were cooking outside; the shops were just open counters that were facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
There were no large trees in the canyon, so the wood was of great value.
The territory of Greenland was not densely populated. If you believe the Scandinavian saga, Eric Rudog was expelled from Iceland for murder, and, sailing west, he came across Greenland, which he called the "Green Land".
But despite its discovery, the Eskimo tribes already lived there at that time.
There were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, despite the fact that each of these countries was "Scandinavian".
If you watched the movie “Treasure of the Nation,” you might think that on the opposite side of the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
However, this does not correspond to reality. Despite the fact that something is actually written on the opposite side of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the Declaration of Independence, on the other hand, were written: “The initial version of the Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776”. The inverted entry is at the bottom of the document.
Who wrote it, no one knows exactly, but it is known that a large parchment paper (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) at the beginning of its existence was folded for preservation.
Therefore, it may be that this record was added there only as a note.
With the landings in Normandy and the subsequent battle, France was able to liberate the north, but the southern part of the country was still under occupation.
It was under the rule of the "Vishishists". It was the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragoon began, with the Allies landing in southern France.
The Americans and the Free France forces liberated the southern territories of France in just two weeks, after which they turned to the side of Germany.
Civilization is the only culture of a fairly large group of people who work and live together in society.
The above-mentioned term "civilization" comes from the Latin word civilis, i.e., "civilian". The latter is similar in meaning to the Latin noun civilis, i.e., "citizen", as well as to the noun civitas, or "city" or "city".
City-states are the forerunners of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transfer of knowledge through generations, equitable distribution, and a sustainable cultural footprint.
Often, small cultures are not considered civilizations in the full sense of the word, because they disappear without leaving behind significant historical testimonies.
During the War of Independence thirteen states initially established a weak central government in accordance with the Treaty on the formation of a confederation of thirteen states. This government included only Congress.
For the introduction of taxes, Congress had no powers, and since there was no national executive and judicial authority, it expected to ensure the enforcement of all laws with the support of state bodies, which were often not geared to interaction.
In addition, it did not have the power to repeal the tax laws and tariffs imposed by the states.
According to the Treaty on the formation of a confederation, a unanimous consent of all states was required to make the changes, and the states did not perceive the rise of the central government so much that their representatives were often absent there.
The Italian national football team, as well as the German national team, ranks second among the strongest national teams in the world. In 2006, it won the World Cup in football.
Football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, water polo, riding a bike, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 racing belong to the popular sports here.
The most popular winter sports are enjoyed in the northern regions, with the participation of Italians in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is located on almost 7000 islands, the largest of which is the island of Hansa. Thanks to this, Japan ranks 7th in the world among the largest islands.
Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in terms of geography, as it is a cluster or group of islands.
The history of Taiwan began in the 15th century. It was then that its name was written by European sailors passing by, as "Farmosa" — it meant "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base on the territory of southwestern Taiwan and initiated a reform of the primitive practice of baking. For processing rice and sugar plantations, the company hired Chinese workers.
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) in 1683 captured the western and northern Taiwan territories and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government in 1895 concluded the Simanasek Treaty, under which Japan was transferred the right of sovereignty over the island, and the last held Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main objects: the Inchihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with three windows.
So that tourists could get a better idea of what most of the buildings on the edges of the complex originally looked like, the latter were rebuilt.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
So, the most popular photo format in the world for stills is the 35 mm format. At the turn of the analog film era, this format of film prevailed.
Such a film is produced even now, however, more importantly, the ratio of its width and height are now used in the formats of the matrix of digital cameras.
This can be a bit of a pant, but in fact the 35 mm format has 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
Accordingly, the ratio of the sides for this format (after dividing by twelve to obtain a simpler proportion of integers) is considered to be 3:2.
Similar or similar aspect ratios have many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats).
The rule of thirds, which is often attacked and ridiculed, presents simple tips that provide dynamism and at the same time retain a certain degree of order in the image.
If you believe him, then the best place to place the main object is at the intersection of the lines that divide the photo into vertical and horizontal planes on the third (see example).
In this period of European history, the activity of the Catholic Church, which became rich and powerful, came under close scrutiny.
Despite all the linguistic and cultural differences that have taken place, the Christian religion has united European countries for more than a thousand years.
All of them, from the king to the prostitute, were under her omnipotent authority.
The essence of one of the main dogmas of Christianity is that wealth must be used to reduce sorrow and alleviate suffering, and that it is precisely for this that there are the means of the church.
For more than a thousand years, the central church authorities were in Rome. Because of this concentration of power and money, many wonder whether this dogma is being carried out.
The United Kingdom initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the start of the war.
The embargo on the supply of vital goods for military and civilian purposes, although it violated universally recognized international law, which over the past two centuries has been consolidated at the legislative level by several international agreements, has nevertheless proved to be an effective strategy.
The United Kingdom replaced international waters so that ships could not enter certain areas of the ocean. Thus, it put even neutral ships in danger.
Due to the fact that a significant response to this tactic was not observed, Germany believed that it would also not be limited to unlimited underwater military actions.
Among the majority of citizens and countries during the 1920s, the moods of pacifism and isolation prevailed.
States and peoples intended to avoid such a situation in the future, because they had already witnessed horrors and atrocities during the First World War.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States because he got a job with the Edison Company, located in New York City.
Only 4 cents, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison, written by Charles Bachalar (his manager from the previous job), were in his pocket when he arrived in the United States.
In ancient China there were unique ways to designate different eras. At each stage of the history of China or in each family in power there were distinctive dynasties.
In addition, the periods of the reign of the dynasties were divided by the periods of the disunited provinces, when instability prevailed. The most famous of them was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the dynasties of Han and Jin.
During these periods, many of the courtiers who fought for the throne conducted indiscriminate hostilities with each other.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China was the era of the Three Kingdoms: thousands of people died during the struggle for the ability to occupy the highest place in the great palace in Xi'an.
The French Revolution had many social and political consequences. Among them was the transition from absolutism to a republican system of government, the introduction of a metrical system, the emergence of nationalism and the belief that the country does not belong to a single right-wing, but to a single people.
In addition, various posts after the Revolution became available to all candidates of the male sex, as a result of which the most successful and ambitious ones were punched up.
The same thing happened in the army, because when previously military titles were assigned, starting from the motto, now — on the basis of skills and abilities.
In addition, many other oppressed workers from other countries were inspired by the French Revolution to start their own revolutions.
The magamet was deeply interested in questions that went beyond the boundaries of peaceful life. In order to meditate and meditate, he often visited the cave on Mount Noor (translated as "light"), which is known as "Hira".
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very vivid picture of the spiritual standing of the Magi.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world – it is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it is very difficult to find, even if someone knows about its existence. Inside the cave you are in complete isolation.
Apart from the clean beautiful skies above and many surrounding mountains you will not see anything. From the cave very little of this world can be seen and heard.
The pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the seven wonders of the world that has survived to our time.
The Great Pyramid is one of the many pyramids that have been erected to honor the memory of the pharaoh-nephew. It was built in the third century BC.
On the Giza Plateau, also known as the Giza Necropolis, in the Death Valley in Egypt, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, temples, and tombs were dedicated to the wives and family members of Pharaoh.
The sign that indicates the movement of the bow up looks like “V”, and down looks like a string or square without the bottom side.
“Move the bow up” means that you have to start the movement from the end of the bow and lead them up, and “move the bow down” — that you have to start from the elbow (this is the place where your hand holds the bow) and lead the bow down.
Movement of the bow up usually gives a softer sound, and down — stronger and more confident.
You can put your marks with a pencil, but do not forget that the printed symbols of the bow stand there not just like that, but with a certain musical occasion, so they usually need to be stored.
On October 6, 1789, due to a crowd of women from the market, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (four-year-old Louis Charles and 11-year-old Maria Theresa), as well as Madame Elizabeth, the king's sister, had to return.
The royal family in Korea was taken to Paris. On their way, a crowd surrounded them — the people in it woke up, languished and shouted threats to the king and the queen.
The king and queen had to open the windows of the carriage under the influence of a crowd of people.
At some point, a man from the crowd bowed before the queen, who was already terrified to death, the head of the slain guard in Versailles.
The war expenses of the U.S. imperialists, which were incurred in connection with the conquest of the Philippines, had to be paid by the Filipinos themselves.
To pay a significant portion of the costs and interest on bonds that were placed through Wall Street banking houses on behalf of the Philippine government, they had to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime.
Undoubtedly, the main achievement of the U.S. imperialists would be the excess profits that brought about the continued exploitation of the Filipino people.
To imagine who the Templars were, it is necessary to understand well what became the prerequisites for the creation of the Order.
Traditionally, the era in which these events took place is called the Classical Middle Ages, a period in the history of Europe that spans the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
First, the Early Middle Ages followed by the Classical Middle Ages, and then the Late Middle Ages. The last, as it is believed, ended in about 1500 AD.
The term "technological determinism" is understood to mean a whole series of practical ideas, from the push for the advancement of certain technologies or the technical necessity to the precise understanding that human destiny is determined by the logic on which science is based and legal.
Two common ideas are characteristic of most of the explanations of technological determinism: the very development of technologies largely goes beyond cultural or political influence, and technologies, in turn, make the property of only them (or themselves).
In particular, there is an opinion that the use of cars stimulates the development of roads.
However, if the number of machines will be small, the national network of highways does not make economic sense. For this reason, the development of new ways of production, which will allow to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Due to the large number of car owners, the number of road accidents is growing. This, in turn, leads to the development of new methods in the field of health care, which allow the treatment of various injuries.
A major element of cultural determinism, influenced by the works of writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel, was characteristic of Romanticism.
When we talk about the era of Romanticism, people were strongly influenced by the geography of presence. Over time, traditions and culture associated with it emerged. They were better than arbitrarily introduced laws, because they existed in harmony with the place and position that occupied the .
While Paris is considered to be the modern fashion capital, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of Europe in feudal times.
Around 400 A.D., the city gained fame as an epicenter of luxury and retained this status almost as far back as 1100 A.D.
During the 12th century its status as the capital of luxury lingerie. This happened mainly because the crusaders returned with gifts, among which were spicy spices and silk, and they were valued much higher than what was offered in the markets of Byzantium.
It was at that time that Constantinople was given the title of the fashion capital of Paris.
The Gothic style flourished in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as in the 14th century.
In the beginning, a strong influence on the style of clothing was exerted by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, Western styles can be delayed by 25-30 years due to the slowness of communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style at the end of the Middle Ages. The fact that people as a result of crusades began to use buttons to jam clothes, was among the biggest events of the time.
In a natural agricultural farm, such a quantity of food is produced, which provides exclusively for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural agriculture is a simple and, as a rule, organic system. It is based on the use of a specific ecological region of the preserved seed in combination with sevacrotum or other non-complex methods. The purpose of all this is to
Many farmers have historically run a natural farm. Now many third world countries are still practising this.
Subcultures bring people with similar views, who from the point of view of social norms feel deprived of attention, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
The age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the representatives may be distinctive features of subcultures.
The definition of a separate subculture can take place on the basis of various factors – linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or their combination.
Members of the same subculture often determine their affiliation to it through distinctive and symbolic styles of dress, manners of behavior, and jargon.
As an illustration of what socialization is and how important it is, most often lead an example with children who have not been lucky enough to grow up in an atmosphere of contempt, neglect, various misfortunes or insults and images and which adults did not socialize in childhood.
Such children are called <0xC2><0xAB>wild». Some <0xC2><0xAB>wild» children have been in captivity for a long time (usually so treated by their own parents); in certain cases, the lack of parental care was the result of the reluctance on the part of parents to notice serious physical or mental insecurities
Before they were left or they escaped, the orphaned children could have suffered serious injuries or suffered an injury.
Others, as if raised animals; according to rumors, some lived in the wild on their own.
When a child is completely raised by animals, his behavior in almost all (taking into account physical limitations) reflects the behavior of the breeder: for example, such a child may be afraid of people or be indifferent to them.
While the purpose of project learning is to make the learning process easier and more interesting, scaffolding in this regard goes even further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an assistant that helps people gain new experience in learning. This can mean using new computer programs or starting a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual. For example, assistants are both a teacher and a small clip in the program "Microsoft Office".
The software provides virtual assistants. They are needed in order to ask questions, make clues and explain the procedures with which the student or listener is difficult to cope on their own.
There are many reasons why children may find themselves in foster families. This can be both a harsh treatment, and neglect, and even coercion.
Children cannot be allowed to grow up in an environment where no one cares about them, they are not raised and they are not engaged in their education, but this is still happening.
In our opinion, the system of foster families is a safe zone for such children.
It is believed that thanks to our system of foster families, nurses will have reliable medical care, safe houses, good and caring caregivers, and a stable education.
It is believed that the foster family must provide all the needs of the child, who was not satisfied in the house from which he was taken.
The Internet is not only a means of mass communication, but also of interpersonal communication.
Due to the special characteristics of the Internet, there are additional opportunities for its use and the satisfaction of the needs of the audience.
Thus, for example, it is thought that concepts such as "education" and "socialization" are difficult reasons to use the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal engagement" and "permanent relationship" have also been defined by Amy and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation in the study of audience response to Internet sites.
Thanks to video recording, important discoveries have been made in the interpretation of microexpressions — meaning the movement of facial muscles, which last only a few milliseconds.
It is claimed, among other things, that the correct interpretation of micro-expressions can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his work The President's Speech, Oliver Sachs noted how people with a damaged brain, without understanding the speech itself, can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that animals —such as domestic dogs— may also be able to correctly interpret a person’s behavior.
The results of the research of the twentieth century testify to the fact that there are two foundations of genetic variability, namely, clear and hidden variations.
Under the influence of mutation, new genetic variations occur, and with the help of selection, they are removed from the pool of detected.
With each subsequent generation, segregation and recombination mix variations in these two pools.
In savannah, available plant resources cannot meet the need for primates in amino acids, when their digestive system is similar to that of humans.
Moreover, if they do not succeed, then the consequences are serious. This is both malnutrition, and depression of growth, and inevitable death.
The most available plant resources would be proteins that can be found in the mother and leaf. However, if they are not properly cooked, then the organisms of such primates as we they are difficult to assimilate.
On the contrary, animal food (forage, termites, eggs) provides the body with a large number of proteins rich in all the necessary amino acids and at the same time is easily absorbed.
Assuming by all, it is not surprising when it turns out that our ancestors solved their own "white problem" in almost the same way as the chimpanzee in the sauna today.
By sleep interruption is meant the deliberate awakening of the sleeping person in the process of normal sleep and falling asleep again after a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this with the help of a relatively quiet alarm clock that wakes you up, but not completely.
If it turns out that you are translating the clock in a dream, try to put it at the other end of the room. Thus, you will need to get up from bed to turn it off.
According to other options based on biorhythms, before going to bed, it is necessary to consume a lot of fluid (primarily water or tea, a well-known diuretic) — this forces a person to get up at night to urinate.
The inner peace of a person is inversely proportional to the tension of his body and spirit.
The available life force is all the more positive than the lower tension. Absolute peace and pleasure are available to everyone.
Illumination can reach everyone. The only obstacle on this path is our own negativity and tension.
At the heart of Tibetan Buddhism is the Buddha's teaching, which has been supplemented by the love of Mahayana and a number of techniques with Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It combines meditation, Kundalini-yoga and love for all humanity.
The followers of Kundalini Yoga claim that in order to awaken the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy), you need to practice certain yoga poses, mantras, and visualizations, as well as perform breathing exercises.
Divine yoga is the main part in the practice of Tibetan meditation. The visualization of different gods allows you to clear the energy channels, open the chakras and achieve enlightened consciousness.
During the Second World War, Germany was a common enemy, thanks to which the USSR and the United States began to cooperate. After the end of the war, systemic, industrial and cultural contradictions led to quarrels between the countries.
Two years after the end of the fighting, the Cold War begins – former allies turn into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years and in it really fought the armies of friendly countries. The battlefields were in different regions — from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defense was broken up until September 17, 1939. The retreat and regrouping along the Romanian positions remained the only hope.
However, in just one night, these plans lost their meaning, because more than 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army in the composition of the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts entered the territory of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet Union and other countries.
Shipping by ship is obviously the most efficient way of transporting a large number of people and cargoes across the oceans.
Traditionally, the task of the naval forces was to ensure that their country was able to transport people and goods, and at the same time, the enemy could not transport its people and goods.
The North Atlantic Company during World War II became one of the most significant examples of this idea. In order to help Britain, the Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop the aforementioned movement, mainly using submarines for this purpose.
Germany would probably be able to conquer Britain in the same way that it would have conquered the rest of Europe if the Allies had failed.
Goats were first domesticated in the Iranian mountains of Zagros about 10,000 years ago.
Representatives of ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them, to always have at hand milk, wool, meat and skins.
Usually domestic goats were grazing in cattle, wandering on the hills or other pastures. Often they were cared for by cossacks — children or teenagers. The latter played the role of shepherds. So the animal is sown in our time.
In the 16th century, roads were built in England.
Although the cobbled roads were only parallel wooden boards, they allowed the heavy horses to move at a higher speed and pull the goods with more weight than on the existing uneven roads.
The slats began to be used to hold the rails in place quite early. However, after a while it became clear that movement along the rails would be more effective if they were covered with a strip of iron.
This practice became more widespread, however, due to the presence of iron, wooden wheels of wagons were more quickly worn.
After some time on the replacement of wooden wheels came iron. The first fully made of metal rails appeared in 1767.
The first known means of movement was the gait. Two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning "man walking"), people began to walk in a vertical posture.
The australopithecines, their predecessors, usually did not go straight.
Passing individuals of Australopithecus are found in fossils, which are 4.2-3.9 million years old, but it is quite possible that seven million years ago, the sachet had already walked on two legs.
You can be more aware of the environment, you can become a participant in the environmental movement, you can even become an activist, so that in the future the mentioned sufferings do not turn out to be very strong.
Often it looks more like symptomatic treatment. However, if we do not need a temporary solution, then we need to find and eliminate the root of the problems.
It is quite obvious that thanks to the technical and scientific achievements of mankind, the world has changed significantly. As a result of overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyle of people, the number of problems has increased.
After the declaration was accepted by Congress on July 4, her manuscript, signed by Congressional Chairman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was delivered to John Dunlap's printing house, which was located a few blocks away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap Arches.
On July 8, John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time in the Independence Hall courtroom.
On July 6, George Washington received one of the copies, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9. On August 10, another copy arrived in London.
To date, there have been 25 first printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (known as Dunlap broadsides). The original manuscript copy has not been preserved.
Many of the modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs managed to survive and that it still exists, only we call them birds.
Due to their feathers and ability to fly, many people do not consider them dinosaurs.
But birds still have a lot in common with dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their legs, lay eggs, and, like tyrannosaurus rex, walk on two hind legs.
Virtually all modern computers perform operations with data encoded in the form of binaries of information.
A binary number can consist of only one of two values - 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers, or (on a computer jargon) bits.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious signs. For example, vomiting is a fairly common symptom, which makes it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
An open container with tablets or toxic household chemicals may be the first evidence of internal poisoning.
Instructions for the provision of emergency medical care for this particular atrophy should be looked at on the label.
To define this group of insect entomologists use the term "claw" in a formal sense.
This term was coined because people had long known that bedbugs were insects that were highly adapted to parasitism in humans.
Both the kiss valves and the bed valves are nesting parasites, they are accustomed to living in the nests or in the house of their master.
About 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are registered in the United States of America. Accordingly, this neurological disease is the main one among young and middle-aged adults.
Scattered sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system. The latter includes the brain and spinal cord, as well as the optic nerve.
According to the study, women are twice as likely as men to suffer from RS.
A couple may come to the conclusion that raising a baby does not correspond to their interest or the interest of the child they already have.
Such couples can give up their child for adoption.
When adopting a child, the parents of the child renounce their parental rights in order to raise and raise him could other spouses.
The main purpose of science is to find out through the scientific method the way the world works. In fact, most scientific research is carried out using this method.
There is, however, not only him. An experiment (this is such a test that is carried out to rule out one or more possible hypotheses with the help of questions and observations) also corrects and stimulates scientific research.
Most of all, philosophers and naturalists paid attention to the classical text. First of all, we are talking about the Bible in Latin.
Common views at the time were considered Aristotle's views on all scientific issues, including in the field of psychology.
When the number of people who had the Greek language decreased, the West turned out to be detached from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many biorhythms that can be observed in the behavior and physiology of animals, to a large extent depend on the presence of endogenous cycles. The latter arise as a result of the functioning of the biological clock.
In most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, periodic rhythms have been recorded, which are not a direct response to external periodic signals.
The biological clock is an autonomous process. Even if the signals do not come from the outside, the aforementioned process continues in the form of independent free-running cycles.
One of the main hypotheses, which argued that DNA is a genetic material, was tested during the Hershey and Chase experiment.
For the implantation of their own DNA in the bacteria Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which, via radioactive phosphorus, the DNA of the bacteriophage was identified, or via radioactive sulfur, the protein of the bacteriophage.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the fragment of the genetic material in which the mutation occurred, and whether the cells affected by it are germline cells, mutations can have a variety of consequences.
Inherited can be only mutations in germ cells. The result of other mutations can be cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts those people who have an interest in visiting different natural areas and territories, because they want to enjoy the general species and landscape, including, enjoy the observations of flora and fauna.
As an example of what you can do in nature, you can bring fishing, hunting, bird watching, visiting parks and studying the ecosystem.
As an example, you can visit, study and photograph the orangutans on the island of Barnea.
People leave their cars every morning from small provincial towns to go to work. Other people who work where they just left are passing by along the way.
In this dynamic transport environment, everyone has one thing or another to do with and support a private car-based transport system.
Scientific evidence suggests that today's high-carbon economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere, which has greatly contributed to human evolution over the past two million years.
Transport systems are used by all people who take part in the life of society. And almost all of them are dissatisfied with these transport systems.
In developed countries, you will hardly hear so many complaints about the fall of bridges or the quality of water.
Why transport systems are a constant source of such complaints, why do they regularly cease to operate? Is there a reason for the lack of competent transport engineers? Is something more important happening?
The concept of "transport movement" implies the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as the study of how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flows presents a complex problem, because it is impossible to predict the behavior of drivers with 100% confidence.
Drivers, fortunately, usually behave quite sequentially; therefore, as a rule, transport flows are characterized by a certain rationally conditioned sequence and can be roughly described by means of mathematical models.
In order to show more fully and qualitatively what constitutes the movement of vehicles, it was established how three of its main parameters are related to each other: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
The presence of these connections helps to plan and design road objects, as well as to carry out their operation.
The first of the animals in the air rose insects. The ability to fly helped them more effectively avoid enemies, as well as find partners and food.
In most cases, the wings of insects are formed along the body.
Because of this, they can be killed in a variety of very small places to hide there from predators.
Strachos and one-day flies are the only insects that can’t form wings.
A man named Aristarchus a few thousand years ago claimed that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many held a different view—that the solar system (including the Sun and other stars) revolved around the Earth.
It sounds reasonable, because being on Earth, it's hard to say it's moving, right?
The Amazon River occupies the second place on Earth in the length of all other rivers and is the largest of them. The volume of water in it is 8 times more than in the river, which occupies the second place.
The largest cancer on Earth is the Amazon, sometimes its width reaches six miles.
The Amazon is the source of at least 20 percent of all the water that flows into the ocean from the planet's rivers.
The Amazon River, which flows from thousands of smaller rivers, has a length of 6387 km (3980 miles).
Although the construction of the pyramids with the use of stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom era, by the size and technical perfection of the construction no one has ever been able to surpass the pyramids of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the period of the New Kingdom came to admire the monuments erected by their ancestors, whose age at that time exceeded a thousand years.
The Vatican is home to only about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world with the smallest population.
In the Vatican's legislation and official messages, the Italian language is used.
Most of those who work in the public sector use Italian as their daily language, while Latin is often used in religious rites.
All members of the Vatican are members of the Roman Catholic Church.
Due to the fact that the main chemical elements (for example, gold, silver and copper) are found in nature in natural form and they are relatively easy to extract with the help of primitive working devices, people knew about them in ancient times.
Philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory which claimed that all things consist of one element or a mixture of several of the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air).
Rather, it looked like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas-like, and plasma, although, according to his theory, they can be transformed into other matter to result in what we observe.
In most cases, alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
In addition, there are such alloys, which include a small number of non-metallic components. Such non-metallic components can be, for example, carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles — atoms.
The size of the atoms is so small that at the point at the end of this sentence, they are located in trillions.
As a result, when the pencil appeared, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the value of the pencil and the frequency of its use decreased as new writing methods appeared.
Nowadays, people write messages on the computer screens, and no one needs a car.
We can only guess what the fate of the keyboard will be when it comes to changing something fundamentally new.
The principle of action of a plutonium bomb is to use the energy of nuclear synthesis when a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons is formed.
It is supposed to roll on top of a very heavy trolley. Re-splitting the core will release part of this energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable. This means that they tend to disintegrate under a slight external influence or without it at all.
The surface of the Moon consists of stones and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side - about 100 km.
Under the lunar dream, the moon is thinner, and under the high mountain — fatter.
The lunar seas may be more on the side of the moon closer to us, because here is a more danceful punishment, and accordingly, lava was easier to rise to the surface.
Local theories are based on what drives people or what they like about them.
These theories stem from the fact that people have certain needs and (or) desires, which they turn into internal and to which they give a subjective character (in other words, internalize) during the centuries.
These theories describe what it is that makes individuals want what they are doing, and what factors in their environment can influence whether they will do certain things.
The "Theory of the Hierarchy of Needs" of Oils and Herzberg's "Two-Factor Theory" are two authoritative place-based theories.
In essence, when managers lead their former colleagues, two types of behavior may occur. At one end of the spectrum will be attempts to remain "their boyfriend" (or "their girlfriend").
The manager, who belongs to this type, can be observed difficulties with the assessment of the effectiveness of work, the adoption of unpopular decisions, the application of disciplinary measures, the distribution of responsibility and the attraction to the responsibility of the guilty.
Another extreme is the situation when a person changes to ignorance – he feels the need to change everything that the team has done so far, and to assign it to himself.
Ultimately, the responsibility for the team's success and failure lies with the leader.
This type of behavior often ends in quarrels between the leaders and the rest of the team members.
The standards of excellence for ordinary teams should also be followed by virtual teams, but there are small differences.
Typically, virtual team members perform the role of a contact center for the appropriate real-world group.
Given that such teams can meet regardless of time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, which may not be understandable to local leadership.
Another unique component of a distributed virtual team is the presence of a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The team of managers to which each member is subordinated — this is the so-called “invisible team”. It defines the standards for each member.
For what reason can an organization want to go through a long process of creating an educational organization? Innovation is one of the purposes of applying organizational concepts of learning in practice.
Creativity and camaraderie can be detected when all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of the organization.
Thus, the process used by the organization, whose employees are trying to overcome some obstacle together, can lead to the emergence of a new innovative process that meets the client's needs.
The leadership of the organization should create a culture for which innovation, knowledge exchange and organizational training are characteristic. Only after this, the organization can be called innovative.
In Angel (2006), a continental approach is a method by which organizations can achieve a higher level of efficiency.
The theoretical approach to knowledge research is reinforced by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data. Thus, the field of research is narrowed and made more accurate.
The results of the research, obtained by scientists, are confirmed by the presence of a close relationship between the pathologies of the brain and the behavior of people.
It has long been known that different types of skull-brain injuries, head injuries, formations, plaques, pathological changes and tumors in the brain have an impact on behavior and alter some of the mental functions.
The development of new technologies makes it possible to study the structure of the brain and the processes in it that are still unknown to us.
As a result, we receive a huge amount of materials and data to build simulation models that, in turn, help us understand the processes taking place in our minds.
Although the term "artificial intelligence" usually evokes associations with science fiction, in fact, AI is a very important field of computer science that deals with the study of behavior, the learning process, and the intellectual adaptation of computers.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes attempts to force machines to automate the tasks that it takes for machines to behave intelligently.
As an example, you can bring up planning and control, the ability to respond to requests and technical problems in customers, as well as recognize faces, voices and wrinkles.
They have distinguished themselves into separate disciplines that study real-life problems and offer solutions for them.
Nowadays, AI is often used in the economy, medicine, technical and military spheres. In addition, it is a component of software for some computer programs and video games.
Excursions make up a significant part of school education. It is not uncommon for a teacher to lead students to places where it is impossible to travel by bus.
With the help of modern technologies, you can organize virtual excursions. Students can get acquainted with museum exhibits, visit the aquarium or admire the beauty of works of art. And all this — without leaving the classroom.
Joint participation in virtual tours is also a very good way to reflect on the trip and share the experience in the classes in the future.
Students at Bennet School in North Carolina, for example, about their trip to the state capital each year design a website, and every year it is reworked, but old versions remain on the web in the form of an album.
In addition, blogging can improve students’ written language. Although at the beginning of blogging grammar and spelling in them are often “cold”, this is usually changed for the better, thanks to the presence of an audience.
Considering that students are usually the most avid audience, the author of the blog, in order to avoid criticism, does everything possible to improve his style.
On the other hand, blogging “helps students better understand the world around them”. The need to support the interest of the audience inspires them and forces them to remain able and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging contributes to collaboration and encourages students to learn much more than the traditional school-based approach offers. -
If students use blogs properly, they will “be able to develop analytical and critical thinking skills; an active response to online materials will help students to draw their own position to what other people have written, as well as to express their views on the problems.”
Atava is an interesting and charming bilingual capital of Canada. Here you can find many art galleries and museums, which allow you to get acquainted with the past of the country and its modernity.
Niagara Falls lies further south, and to the north is Lake Muskoka, famous for its unspoiled natural beauty.
That's why, and for many other reasons, tourists, visitors and other foreigners consider Ant<0xC3><0xA1>ria to be a typical Canadian province.
In large parts of its territory, which are further north, very few people live, and some even in general represent almost an uninhabited desert.
To compare the population, one can cite the following fact, which is surprising to many: the number of African Americans in the United States exceeds the total number of citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located near the east coast of Africa and belong to the islands of the Indian Ocean.
Undoubtedly, Madagascar is the largest of them. If we talk about the living nature, it can be compared to a separate continent.
Almost all of the smaller islands are either independent states, or refer to France. They are famous for their luxurious beach resorts.
In addition, the Arabs brought Islam with them to these lands, and this religion quickly spread to the Comoros and the island of Mayotte.
Until the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope, refers to the beginning of European influence and the politics of colonialism.
The northern boundary of this region is the Sahel, and the southern and western boundary is the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Tourists are always advised to say that they are married, even if it is not the case.
In addition, it may be useful to wear a ring (so that it does not look too expensive).
Women need to understand that as a result of cultural differences, they may face behaviors that will suit them with charm. Local residents can often bother tourists, grab their hands and so on.
Decisively deny men and boldly defend your opinion (despite cultural differences, it's absolutely unacceptable!).
Modern Casablanca in the 10th century BC was founded by Berber fishermen. The Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids used this city as a strategic port, which was called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city, and then rebuilt it again under the name Casa Branca (White House). After the earthquake of 1755, they left this place.
The Moroccan sultan restored the city and named it Daru l-Badzi. The name of the city of Casablanca was derived from the Spanish traders who set up trading bases there.
In all of Morocco Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping.
Near the Old City of Medina you can find quite quickly places where traditional Moroccan products are traded – leather products, pottery products, tajins, hookahs and various toys, however, they are all intended exclusively for tourists.
Goma is a city in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo near the border with Rwanda, which is popular with tourists.
In 2002, Goma washed lava from the face of the earth from the Niiragonga volcano. It buried under it the majority of the city streets, mainly in the center of the city.
Despite the fact that the city of Goma itself is safe enough to go beyond its borders, it is worth conducting a small investigation to find out if hostilities are taking place at some point in the province of North Kivu.
In addition, the city plays the role of a base for climbing the Niiragonga volcano. Here, too, very cheap services for mountain gorilla watching enthusiasts are offered — more attractive prices in Africa are difficult to find.
To get around Gomu, you can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The standard (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
As a result of Tambuktu's comparative inaccessibility, his name began to be used as a metaphor for the designation of distant exotic sites.
Despite the reputation of touristic fame and the presence of the airport, today Timbuktu is a city dominated by hail.
In 1990, due to the threat from the sands of the desert, it was included in the list of World Heritage sites threatened by danger.
Henry Lewis Gates paid a lot of attention to this city in the PBS program "The Wonders of the African Continent".
Compared to other cities in the country, the city stands out even more because it has more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (NPK) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa. In the east it borders with Mozambique, in the north — with Zimbabwe, and along the river Krakadzil passes its southern border.
The area of the park is 19 500 km2. It has 14 acazons, each of which live different animals and grow different plants.
It is one of the most interesting places in the country, and is also considered to be the most significant of the National Parks of South Africa.
As in all the national parks of the South African Republic, the park receives a daily entrance fee and an ecological fee is charged from the visitors.
In addition, it may be advantageous to purchase the so-called Wild Card, a pass that gives the right to visit several parks in South Africa or all national parks in the PAR.
The country's name Hong Kong is borrowed from the island of Hong Kong, which is the center of attraction for many tourists.
The beautiful buildings of Hong Kong, which form the architectural face of the city, are compared to a brilliant column diagram, and the waters of Victoria Harbour only emphasize its presence.
The best views of Hong Kong can be enjoyed if you leave the island and head for the one located opposite the waterfront of Kowloon.
Much of Hong Kong's urban development is compactly located along the northern coast on arid lands.
In the past, this place was taken over by colonizers from the UK, so if you want to see the evidence of the colonial past with your own eyes, then you need to start right here.
The Sundarbans Forest is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, it stretches for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast at the depths of Bangladesh and the interior of India.
