It is a matter of concern to the British AManna ‘that they should be allowed to appear’
There is a caveat among some AMs before the recommendation that their entitlement should be changed to MWPanna (British Bige Parliamentary Member).
The election was prompted by plans to change the name of the assembly to the Bige British Parliament.
There is a belief in AManna across the political spectrum that they will be a magician's head.
One time, the Labour Party said its groups were concerned "that it makes me laugh with Twp and Pwp"
A goal for readers from outside the UK: Stupid twp and pwp cuck in the UK.
He told Plaid Cymru that the group as a whole was not "more than happy" and that alternative recommendations had been made.
One person told the Conservative Party that his group was biased about the name change, but noted that there was not much difference in pronunciation between the MWP and ‘Muppet’ in English.
In this context, the letter w in the English language is pronounced in conjunction with the pronunciation of the letter u in English Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission currently drafting the legislation to introduce the name changes said: "It is of course up to the Members themselves to take the final decision on any reporters under the name to be given to the Assembly Members."
The Bige British Assembly was given the power in The Government of Wales Act 2017 to change its name.
The Commission published the results of a public consultation in June on the proposals in which widespread support was received for the nomination of the assembly as the Bige British Parliament.
As for the title of MPs, the Commission's choice was the Welsh Parliament Members (WMP), but it was the MWP option that received the most support in a public consultation.
AManna is apparently recommending alternative options, but the duo to come up with any opinion could be the heart of Chief Officer Elin Jones, who is expected to submit draft legislation on the changes in a few weeks' time.
The legislation on the other amendments will include changes to the way in which the assembly operates, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and on the design of the committee system.
The final vote will be taken on the issue of what title they will be entitled to when they discuss the legislation.
The day of the vote for the people of Macedonia is in the referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will put their vote on Sunday on the right to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia."
A conciliation on the referendum has been reached as part of an effort to negotiate for years with Greece along the border, which is also known by the name of Macedonia.
The government in Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbours is equivalent to a claim on its territory, and has repeatedly objected to their application for membership of the EU and ECAT.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
Supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, insist that the name change is the same as the price to be paid if membership is to be accepted in the EU and in ECAT.
St. Martin's Chapel is closed and churches are located in Harlem.
"Historically, the elders I spoke to said that there was a bar and a church around every corner," Mr. Adams said.
"There's no one there today."
He said he understood the situation.
"People are going out in different ways today," he said.
"The bars are no longer sitting rooms for the public as people go on a regular basis."
As for the churches, it is a matter of concern to him that the money will not last from the sale of assets as long as leaders are willing, "and they will be right back where they started sooner or later."
Buildings for apartments could come in place of the churches, and there are many of the kind of people who do not help with the remains of the dormitories in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in those buildings will be white-skinned," he said, "and it's as if they're going to speed up the day those churches are completely demolished because most of the people who move into those buildings aren't likely to."
The two churches were built with communities with a bright complexion before Harlem became a major city for people with a blue complexion - the Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's ten years later.
The fashion industry began to take off in the 1930s.
A blue-haired community took the title of the building, a community that was worshipping close at hand.
A blue-skinned community took possession of St. Martin's under the Honor. John Howard Johnson, who was leading a baghcat against 125th Street retailers, was on a major shopping street in Harlem, who was opposed to recruiting or raising people with a blue-skin in their ranks.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but parishioners with Father Johnson commissioned the bell when they proposed reconstruction plans.
David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his companion at St. Martin's, baptized "the bell of the contemporaries" on the monastery.
The expert who sang the bell in July gave him something else: "Cultural bowl" and "historical musical tool that could not be found replica."
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the world's first bell to be played by a blue-skinned musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the no longer prominent bell at the Riverside Church eighteen years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's representative did not find him.
A complex story between architects and contractors seen at St. Martin's over the past few months, of the church's tuat leaders who introduced some, and which is the episcopal deity that some of them introduced.
The actress - the parish's own governing body - wrote to the diocese in July about her concerns "that the diocese should look to pass on the costs" to the bishops, although the bishops were not involved in the succession of the architects and conquistadors of the diocese.
Some of the people of the parish made a lament over the lack of transparency on the part of the deity.
A 13-year-old boy is being bullied while diving under a sledgehammer in California.
A 13-year-old boy's shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday when he was diving on a sledgehammer in California on the first day of a sledgehammer meal, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Speaking to KSWB-TV in San Diego, Chad Hammel said he had been diving with his friends for about half an hour about Saturday when he heard the boy screaming for help, and then scolded him to help him remove the saw.
Hammel said that at first he thought that there were only germs from birth, and that he then realized “that it was a ‘bitch bite’!
We're going to get caught!"
"They were all together," he said when he reached out to the man.
"I let everyone get out of the saddle: 'There's a shark under the saddle!'" Hammel told him.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego as he is classified with malfeasance.
It is not known which species of shark was responsible for the attack.
The Captain of the Rescue Guard Larry Giles told an intelligence meeting to media that a shark has been found in the area a few weeks since, but it was considered not to be a dangerous species of shark.
Giles told him that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries to his knee.
The officers closed the path into the beach between Ponto Beach in Casablad and Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
Giles noted that there were no more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered to be dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to land on the UK scheme market.
Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with their retail-style scheme passengers and a team of special assistants.
It's part of a campaign that's not just entering the UK's <0xC2><0xA3>2.8bn scheme market, and which is still growing while fashion sales and household goods are declining, which will test the bigger scheme passports in 11 more stores around the country, and which will be shipped to more than 100 countries around the world.
The investment in planned goods comes as part of the supermarket's effort to fill space in the shelves in their receipts of televisions, microwaves and household goods at the time.
Sainsbury's said it would be increasing the number of its dual scheme goods by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current areas from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also receive more space with branded areas such as those found in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique forging field, so that the bulk of the products will be used by veggies - which requires more young shoppers.
In addition, the Fragrance Shop retailer will be testing a permit in both stores with Sainsbury's, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week; with the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, out this year.
The trends of online shopping and to buy small amounts of food every day at local convenience stores are putting pressure on supermarkets to do more to attract people in.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that there will be a look like department stores at the malls in a row and the series of stores are looking to come together against the Aldi and Lidl discount stores with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has put Argos in the hundreds of stores, and also introduced some Habitats since they bought those two series of stores two years ago, which they say has boosted wholesale sales and added to the profitability of the acquisitions.
Click on the previous attempt of the wholesale market to renew its scheme and pharmaceutical divisions on a regular basis.
Sainsbury's joint venture with Boots was tested in the early 2000s, but the bond was terminated after an investigation into how to share proceeds from the pharmacies in their supermarkets.
That new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business with 281 stores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy pharmacy series, for <0xC2><0xA3>125m, three years ago.
They said that Lloyds would play a role in the plan, but add an additional field to the skin care somatic brands with their La Roche-Posay and Vichy counts in four shops.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director at Sainsbury's, said: "We've changed the look and feel of scheme passports from the ground up to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also made an investment in specific colleagues who will be available to provide advice.
Our range of brands has been designed to be suitable for every demand, and the enticing environment and convenient locations mean that we are now an excellent scheme target with a challenge on the old shopping route."
Peter Jones 'overwhelmed' after Holly Willoughby pulls back from <0xC2><0xA3>11 million market
Dragons star Peter Jones was left stranded after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled back from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million market with her business in the lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and hITV
Willoughby does not have any time for its home goods and accessories brand Truly.
The pair's business and Goop brand have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow.
On Instagram, the 37-year-old actress announced that she is leaving this morning.
Holly Willoughby has put the Peter Jones constellation from Dragons Den on hold as she pulls back from her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the end of the day - to focus on their new major contracts with Marks & Spencer and HITV.
Our information sources said Jones was 'overjoyed' when a white TV girl admitted during a full-on meeting with tension Tuesday at the headquarters of her in-house business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that she would no longer have enough time with her new markets - up to <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
The business was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand, and was predicted to double Willoughby's estimated wealth of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
And Willoughby, 37, announcing on Instagram that she was going to leave Truly, Jones went on a plane out of the UK with one of his holiday homes as his target.
The source said: "It was truly one of Holly's priorities.
It would be like a long-term future for her with which she would work her life for the next ten years.
Everyone who participated in it was removed with their decision to leave the market.
No one would believe what was going on on Tuesday, because it was so close to the launch.
There is a lot of trade to be had with goods inside the headquarters in Marlow that are ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter This Morning could be one of the most reliable for-profit constellations in Britain, which would cost the business millions due to the investment that is not small in the products between accusations and allegations, and in and of itself.
And it could end a friendship that lasted for several years.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, who have three children, have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for the past ten years.
It was Willoughby who founded Truly along with Capp West in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The two couples go on vacations together, and Jones has a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production business.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will join Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity with hITV.
A source close to Jones said: "We will not comment on matters relating to his business affairs."
"We fell in love and then we fell in love"
He laughed at the criticism he received from the news media of the trade being "unpresidential" to the eyes of some people, and of being so positive under the leader of North Korea.
Why is there so much pressure on President Trump?
Trump said while allowing him to be a "mainstream news anchor."
"I didn't get anything."
He noted that Kim showed interest in the second meeting after its opening meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump announced as a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
The negotiations on nuclear disarmament have come to an end.
It has been more than three months since a summit in Singapore in June when North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the U.S. General Assembly last Saturday that the North does not see a "response" from the West.
Instead, he noted that the US is still imposing sanctions with the aim of keeping pressure on them.
Trump wasn't very successful in his speech.
"We're doing a great job with North Korea," he said.
"We've been in talks with the North Koreans.
Millions of people will be killed.
And now we have a great relationship."
He said that positive results came from his efforts to improve the relationship with Kim - the rocket tests were terminated, they helped to release fugitives and bring the bodies of the members of the U.S. armed forces home.
And he defended his unusual approach in the way he talks about his relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be so presidential, but instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get permission to enter this crowded place, 200 people would be standing aloof," Trump said, referring to the crowd directly in front of him.
Hundreds of people are killed on an island with tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia
After the creation of land on Lombok, add in case, told the foreign non-governmental organizations that they did not need to be present.
Although no more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population was expelled from their own districts, no national disaster was announced, pre-binding it to generate international aid.
"In many cases of the disaster, they have safely said that they do not want international assistance, so it is very challenging," Mr. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting teams together to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether the foreign team can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman for the national disaster agency, said that Indonesian officials were assessing the case in Palu to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
In view of the land structure seen in Indonesia on a continuous basis, the preparations before the end of the nature are horrendous.
Although sunshades were built against tsunamis in Aceh, they are not usually seen on any other coast.
The apparent lack of a warning base prior to tsunamis in Palu, while a warning was in effect, was likely to contribute to the loss of the number of lives.
The journey between the islands of the Indies is challenging when it comes to people.
It is much more difficult to cope with natural disasters.
A hospital ship located in Lombok to treat the victims of the earthquake is heading towards Palu, and it will take at least three days to arrive at the scene of the disaster.
President Joko Widodo has upgraded Indonesia's broken infrastructure at the heart of his election campaign, and has spent a large sum of money on roads and railways.
However, Joko's administration suffered funding shortfalls and was forced to re-elect him the next year.
Mr. Joko is also coming under pressure from the ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, as some people from the Muslim world have adopted a more conservative kind of faith.
No more than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were driven out of their villages when riots broke out between Christian and Muslim riots on the streets, and massacres, riots and soldiers, and other sharp weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge with Liverpool find the score balanced by the last two against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing the game against Chelsea in the Premier League with his score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge got a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri and is about 30 yards away from Chelsea's side and his team to a 1-0 back.
He held the ball on his left foot before he let go of the long tail.
The attempt went high above the box and she approached the top corner to the right of the net.
The ball just took over the jump at Kepa Arrizabalaga in the back and fell into the meadow.
"I just wanted to reach that place, get the ball, and players like Shaq progress as much as possible, so I just tried to create as much time as I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante and I gave the ball a little kick and I didn't think so much about it and I tried to back up."
Chelsea had a 1-0 lead at Leeds after finding a score in the 25th minute with the Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Passed the centre-forward with his goal for the team in the back blue jersey as far as Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning from the middle of the park and giving Liverpool half of the park.
Kovacic took a pass and quickly walked into the middle of the park.
He then walked through a beautiful passage, which led Hazard into the box.
Hazard ran over the defenders and took the final blow into the net of the furthest tail with his left foot over Alisson Becker with the Liverpool team.
Liverpool will face Napoli at the group stage of the Champions League at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europe Series at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll in Indonesia's tsunamis has risen to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said on Sunday.
Many people have been reported to be outraged about the smirking of the buildings laid by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake that struck last Friday, and waves were generated as high as 20 feet, as the Sutopo Purwo Nugroho agency spokesman told a press conference.
The city of Palu with a population of 380,000 was filled with smiles from falling buildings to each other.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after he killed a woman.
An investigation has been launched into a murder after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old woman's body was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds on Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police rushed into the area to find people who had heard or seen nothing to come to them.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "We are early in the investigation but would request that anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
We would also ask anyone, especially taxi drivers, to think of nothing with their make-up cameras to contact us as they might have information that would be crucial to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman who found her body was a local woman in Birkenhead, and that she had been found inside a property.
There are friends with the woman who believes they knew her after coming to the scene this evening to ask questions about the place where she was found this morning.
Investigations are still underway as the police have said they are currently investigating the disappearance of the victim.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews has just tried to return to his apartment, but the police are telling him that no one is allowed in or out of the building.
He was left speechless when he learned about what had happened.
Residents are now being told that there will be a few times before they are allowed back in.
One police officer told one man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene and threw down the towel.
She said, "This is terrible."
There were two lanes with the police inside the protected line at 2pm, with one other lane just outside it.
A number of police officers were standing inside the security line watching the apartment block.
Anyone with information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and log 247 on September 30th.
Chromail's statue inside Parliament is the latest reminder to be the subject of a dispute over ‘rewriting history'
Extinction would be a compensation for his complete destruction, such as the Taliban, of many of England's religious cultural treasures at the hands of fanatical adherents or the Pirates under whom they were baptized.
The Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's recommendation as a "fool" and an "effort to rewrite history"
John Goldsmith, chair of the Cromwell Society, said: "The current debate about the removal of the images would be expected to be a real Chrome Level outside of Westminster Palace.
It was not Cromail himself who ordered or carried out the resurgence in the civil wars of England.
Perhaps the sacrifice of the Chromail would be wrongly made out of the actions of Thomas's ancestors in the first place.
The real beauty that William Hamo Thorneycroft designed on Chromail is evidence of the 19th-century opinion, and it is part of the statistics about one who many people believe is even celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people, perhaps no more in the 19th century than there were today, would think that Cromail was a defender of the parliament against external pressure, in this case against the monarchy of course.
It is still a matter of historical debate and this is a complete interpretation of the subject itself.
The conflict from the mid-17th century is certain to have created the development of our nations since then, and he is an identifiable individual who acts as a representative for one-half of that school.
It is also worth celebrating and commemorating his achievements as the Lord Protector."
A Chinese Farmer's Pig Is Seriously Injured To Death
A farmer's pig attacked and killed inside a market in the south-west of China, according to local media reports.
The man with the surname ‘Yuan’ was found dead with his cut artery, and he was mashed with blood close to a pig carcass at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to inject vaccines into the pigs at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai province, China.
It was reported that he travelled with his cousin four from the neighboring Yunnan province last Wednesday with 15 pigs sold at the market.
Four o'clock in the morning came to him, and he was dead, and he found that a doorway with a pig's neck was widened by his hand.
He said there was a large pig inside the crow with blood in its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig did indeed attack the farmer or that he died, according to the report itself.
"My legs were bloody and broken," the four-year-old said with the surname ‘Wu,' about as reported in the Guiyang Evening News.
The film showed from the security camera that Yuan entered the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pig.
His body was found about once in a while.
It's not the yuan or the four-legged animal that killed the man.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up so it wouldn't attack anyone else, and the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are reported to be conducting negotiations for compensation for his death.
There are records in the handling of cases in which pigs have been made, although they are rare.
A woman and her husband were attacked by a pig in 2016 at their farm in Massachusetts, and suffered critical injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 650 pounds was added to a Breton farmer's tractor or his wife had scanned the animal for directions.
After your pig was eaten by a farmer in Oregon in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBS News that your pig is not usually aggressive but a taste of the blood can function as a ‘benefit.’
"They just want to have fun.
They treat you like animals, they're really aware of you... they don't want to hurt you.
You have to show them respect," he said.
Heavy rain will come widely to the west of the United States from the remnants of Hurricane Rosa
As predicted, Rosa's hairline is weakening and moving over the cooler tide off the north coast of Mexico.
The floods with Rosa will come a long way from hurricanes across northern Mexico and the U.S. southeast in the next few days.
It was windy 85 miles per hour with Rosa, a Category 1 Hurricane, as of 5:00 a.m. Eastern Sunday, and was located 385 miles south-west of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is hoped that Rosa will move from the north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, climes are coming together across the Pacific Ocean and it will move east towards the West Coast of the US. And Rosa approaching the peninsula of Baja California on Sunday as a tropical storm, it will start pushing tropical moisture deep north into the west of the US.
Up to 10 craft eggs will arrive with Rosa to parts of Mexico next Monday.
It is then that heavy rain will be generated widely with the theocratic humidity interacting with the class coming into the Northeast for a few days.
Between 1 inch and 4 inches of rain will be caused by dangerous tulips, smiley streaks and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep hypothermia will cause mortality rates to reach 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
It is expected that between 2 and 4 inches of rain will fall in parts of the Northeast, especially over most of Arizona.
Tulips can occur with the conditions going to dawn quickly due to the type of spread of tropical rains.
It was decided to go out into the desert on foot with the danger of the hurricane there.
The heavy rains could be the cause of terrible flooding of the rivers in the canyons, and local wind and dust storms will come with the thunderstorms.
Some heavy rains will come with the class approaching parts of California's south coast.
The number of rains could be above the plateau, which could generate miniaturized streams and slippery roads accordingly.
This was the first time that the region had experienced rain in its wet season.
A number of scattered tropical rain showers will begin to approach Arizona slowly on Sunday and late Monday, before the rain will spread more widely slowly on Monday and next Tuesday.
It will be held in the four corners of the building on Tuesday and will last for the rest of the day.
Sharp fluctuations in temperature can be seen in October throughout the United States as the Arctic cools, and the ice sheet is waiting for a relative technologist.
As a result, significant changes in temperature occur over a short period of time.
A great example of the great temperature variations will be seen throughout the US mid-Sunday.
The temperature will vary by nearly 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the end of summer heat will try to grow again.
October is predicted to see a warm start for many mid- and eastern U.S. states, with temperatures in the 1980s widely across the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
Eighty steps could be found in New York City on Tuesday, and 10 steps would be in and out of the average temperature.
We are indicating with our long-term forecast that there will be a high probability of above-average temperatures for the U.S. east half through the first half of October.
More than 20 million people listened to Brett Kavanaugh.
No more than 20 million people watched the real-life evidence from the Brett Kavanaugh nomination for the Supreme Court and the woman who filed for it that he sexually assaulted her, alleging that the 1980s shooting, Christine Blasey Ford, took place on a hot six-net.
Meanwhile, the political vacuum continued, with the broadcasters breaking into a regular registration for Friday's final: an agreement negotiated with Arizona Senator Jeff Flake before the FBI to conduct an investigation into the alleged changes.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is one hundred percent certain that Kavanaugh had beaten her and drunk her, and tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in his testimony, is six hundred percent certain that it didn't happen.
It is likely that no more than 20.4 million people watched Nielsen's report on Friday.
That business included the audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures did not immediately provide a basis for the other networks on display, including PBS, C-SPAN and the Fox Business Network.
And it's common for some blacks to relate to Nielsen by measuring the number of people who look into the offices.
As a comparable measurement stack to that, the number of viewers and the same number for a qualified game in American football equals.
Fox News Channel, which strongly supported its host-opinions with the appointment of Kavanaugh, was among the networks with an average audience of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
The demand was still high after the hearing.
Flake was at the heart of last Friday's drama.
After the office of the esteemed Republican issued a statement that he would be voting in Kavanaugh's favor, he was caught with CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning getting a luncheon from viewers and wanting to take an elevator to the Justice Committee hearing.
He was standing with his eyes about for a few minutes as they wore him down, broadcast on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you," one woman said.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in front of the country?
Someone said to him, "You are the power and the little power that many women have."
Flake said his office issued a statement and told him, before the elevator hit, that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All cable and broadcast networks were covering courses at times thereafter, when the Judicial Committee had to vote to forward Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate for a vote.
But Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the allegations against the nominee next week, which was what the Democratic majority wanted.
They were chatting with his friend, Senator Chris Coons, who hosted Flake.
It was after a conversation with Coons and several senators later, that Flake made his decision.
Flake's choice had power, as Republicans clearly wouldn't have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations of Kavanaugh.
The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Mrs May, has said that she is considering the possibility of holding political games on Brexit.
Prime Minister Theresa May has criticised her plans to leave the European Union for "political games" about Britain's future and national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, September 29, 2018.
In another interview near the front page of the newspaper, Boris Johnson pushed ahead with his attack on his Brexit plan, or Chequers plan as it is called, saying that the proposal would kill off Britain and the European Union as a result of "tariffing on each other."
'Wayde Sims' shooting: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson over LSU player's death
Police suspect Wayde Sims's death in a fatal shooting, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and registered in prison for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
The officers released a video of the altercation between Sims and Simpson, and the police said that Sims lost his glasses during the fighting.
Police found the glasses from the scene and said they found DNA from them with Simpson, as reported by WAFB, a affiliate of CBS.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to the deadly shooting of Wayde.
The bond was set at $350,000, according to the Advocate.
The Coroner's Office of East Baton Rouge Parish released a preliminary report last Friday, stating that a gunshot wound to the head and into the neck of the cause of death.
The department is acknowledging the Louisiana State Police's task force on theft, the state police's crime lab, Southern University's police, and the district's citizens for assisting with the investigation into the seizure.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the law enforcers for adopting "their ambition and dedication to the pursuit of justice."
Sims was 20 years old.
The front 6 foot 6 inch tall grew up in Baton Rouge as his father Wayne played basketball with LSU as well.
It was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game on the average he found last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was "three together" and "overwhelmed" by Wayde's death.
"That's a matter of concern in a lecture," Wade said.
A short distance from the city center of Mexico City
The volcano is erupting from the Popocatepetl volcano after reaching the southern areas of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for the Prevention of Disasters warned the Mexican people on Saturday to stay clean from the volcano after the activity increased inside the crater, and it registered 183 gas emissions and mentions in a 24-hour period.
The center was under surveillance of tornadoes and multiple explosions.
The images on social media showed that there were thin layers of a cover of quotations on the windshields of cars in the areas in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geoscientists noted an increase in activity at the 45-mile (72-kilometer) volcano east of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The so-called "Don Goyo" volcano has been active since 1994.
There were clashes between Catalan police and secessionists before the fair day's commemoration of the independence vote.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a showdown between demonstrators for independence and riot police, and thousands taking part in rival demonstrations to commemorate the one-year anniversary of Catalonia's split vote.
A yellow radish squeezed with chicks eggs and fired powdered paint on the cherry police who were holding back, creating a cloud of dark dust in the streets that would normally be crowded with tourists.
There were also skirmishes in the day, and the police were using their guns to restrict the fight.
The song "No Forget, No Forgiveness" was triumphant in favor of independence right in front of unanimous performers chanting "To the Mayor of Spain."
Fourteen people received medical treatment for injuries in the demonstrations, the local press reported.
Tensions are still high in the region where a year has passed since the October 1 referendum in Madrid deemed it illegal, but celebrated by Catalan secessionists.
Voters chose to become independent with a high majority, although the percentage that came out with the baghcat was low among the trends against the separation of the largest.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent the vote at polling stations across the region with violent suicides there.
There were riots in favor of independence after they were laid to rest on Friday night to demonstrate in support of the national police.
The show went on, but they had to find a different way.
Narcissus Termes, 68, said an electrician attending the demonstration of the secessionists with his wife was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
"We've seen one of the best times we've ever seen.
I saw my parents crying with surprise that they could cast a vote, but we're exhausted now," he said.
Despite the fact that the Catalan parties found in favour of independence a crucial victory in the run-up to last December's regional elections, they did not manage to maintain that continuity this year with many of their well-known leaders' insistence on their support for the latter.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the demonstration to support the police on his phone, said it was the politicians on both sides who fueled the conflict.
"The tension is rising unabated," he said.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who was put in jail before his trial since the end of last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Competiting as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline in democratic values and the foot on the stomach of the Spanish government," he said.
City of Dolores: Men were arrested after their house was hit by a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after being hit by a car in Dublin City.
The incident took place on Thursday's Chorr<0xC3><0xA1>n na gCeard at around 19:30 BST.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
The car may also have been on the road for some time.
Menga scores 1-0 victory for Livingston over Rangers
It was Dolly Menga's first back on Livingston's behalf who saved the win.
Livingston had an unprecedented win over Rangers, and Steven Gerrard's second loss was his 18th game as manager of the club from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's score was the difference in the end and Gary Holt's team equalled Hibernian in second place.
He leaves Gerrard's home team unbeaten in the season's Main Series and faces Hearts, and they have eight points to spare, next Sunday.
Rangers will have a home run against Rapid Wien in the Europa Series next Thursday.
Livingston meanwhile adds his unbeaten game count to six games, and Holt's head coach still unbeaten since joining Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston's scoring doesn't stand a chance against Maola's visitors
Holt's team should have progressed well before they scored, and had a lot of difficulties with their method directly for Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through the defensive line towards the back but put his attempt across the back's mouth, and then Alan Lithgow could only try to get in after he slipped in to meet Craig Halkett's header across the back.
The home team was willing to let Rangers play for them, with the knowledge that they would do damage to the visitors from home with the fixed items.
And that's how the back was made.
Rangers took a free kick and Livingston created halfsheans, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson playing together to give Menga a chance, who grabbed the ball and scored from the centre of the box.
Rangers had been in possession of the ball by that time, but they failed to break the defenders of the home team and there was no duel on Liam Kelly's manager,
That story continued into the second half, though Kelly had to make a save from Alfredo Morelos.
Rangers batsman Alan McGregor knocked on Scott Pittman's door with his feet and Lithgow led a policeman in catches from another fixture with Livingston.
Cross passes entered the Livingston box continuously and were permanently cleaned, and two claims on Irish chic were rejected - after Halkett challenged Rep. Glenn Middleton, and one on handling.
"Incredible Reality" from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont with BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Excellent quality and service in Livingston.
All the players were getting better, overstepping their expectations in that way.
His playing style and personals have changed little since they returned to the main section, but Holt must be commended for how he inspired the team since he came in.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was improving, overseeing the royal defenders, and Menga retained Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their side from the beginning.
There was also a lack of inspiration from Rangers.
Although they gave great evidence at one time about Gerrard, they came to a large backlash on those standards.
The last pass was missing - they didn't break through the home team just once - and it's an eye-opening type for Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
A warm welcome to Erdogan in Cologne.
Saturday (September 29th) saw a gloomy and blue sky and the leaders of Turkey and Germany meeting for a breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is designed to repair relations between the ECAT allies.
They have succeeded in addressing a number of issues including human rights, media freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then turned to Cologne to open a huge new mosque.
The largest Turkish population is found outside of Turkey itself in that city.
The police cited security reasons to prevent the crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of the supporters came out nearby to watch their president.
The voices of hundreds of demonstrators against Erdogan have also been heard - many of them in their own country - as they strongly condemn Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The abstruse objections to the visitor's separation are shown, being worshipped as a hero by some German Turks and severely punished as an athlete by others who are not.
Road description in Deptford: Bicycles die due to being hit by a car
A man has died after being hit by a car in London.
The tour took place near the junction between Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, on a busy road in Deptford, to the west of the city, at around 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and attended paramedics on the spot, but the man died there.
The crash comes a few months after the death of another cyclist in a crash and escape incident on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturn's centre.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and to identify his relatives.
There are closed roads and bus diversions, and motorists have been advised to avoid the area.
<0xE2><0x86><0x91> "Lartin Ship Prison: Six Officers Injured During Autonomy".
Six prison officers have been injured during a raid at the men's high-security car, the Prison Office said.
The train at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire took place around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still running.
Officers and specialists "Tornado" were brought in to deal with the plot, which involves eight henchmen and is limited to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor injuries in front of them at the scene.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: "An isolated prison staff has been deployed to deal with a continuing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
A number of staff members were treated for their injuries.
We do not accept the violence in our prisons, and we are absolutely certain that those responsible will be put in front of the police and that they will be able to put another distance into the prison."
There are more than 500 prisoners in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the country's most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the governor of the prison had received a fair medical treatment in the hospital after his prisoner attacked him.
And last October, crippling officers were called in to deal with a serious piece of equipment in which the team was attacked with bullets.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flooding disasters (which could be in the interest of a serious area)
Arizona is rarely faced with a hurricane, but it's likely that this will happen early next week and the remnants of Rosa's Hurricane energy are focusing over the West Coast, and the risks of hurricanes with it.
The National Weather Service issued tulip parades for Monday and Tuesday west of Arizona into southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a route directly over the Phoenix on Tuesday, and he will be putting on a show around Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix specified in a tweet that there were only "ten tropical cyclones that have maintained their tropical storm status or dropped within 200 miles of Phoenix since the 1950s!
"Katrina (1967) was a hairdresser within 40 miles of the AZ border."
The latest models of the 2 inch to 4 inch Hairline National Centre are pre-recorded, and detached sizes up to 6 watches in Mogollon Rim Arizona.
There seems to be 1 to 2 inches of grass in other areas of the Southwest including the Central Rockies and The Great Basin, and there may be a total of up to 4 watches.
For those who are out of the risk of tuberculosis now, Rosa's condition may be a blessing because there is drought in the region.
While flooding is a matter of serious concern, some of that potential could be beneficial as there is currently drought in some parts of the Northeast.
"According to the U.S. Triumvirate, at least 40 percent of Arizona is dianthropic, the second-highest category," according to weather.com.
First of all, Hairic<0xC3><0xAD>n Rosa takes over the peninsula of Baja California Mexico.
Rosa, who still has a hurricane strength on Sunday morning with winds of 85 miles per hour, is 385 miles east of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is coming to colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and so it is losing power.
Therefore, it is expected that she will land in Mexico at the strength of a tropical storm in the evening or Monday night.
The possibility of flooding throughout parts of Mexico could be severe, and there is a significant risk of flooding due to this.
"A total of 3 to 6 watches from Baja California are expected to enter northwestern Sonora, and it could be 10 of them," weather.com reported.
Rosa then heads north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical slug, which then travels through Arizona and into southern Utah slowly on Tuesday night.
"The main prize she is expected to receive from Rosa or her very heavy rain showers in California, Sonora to the north east, and the Southwestern Desert of the US," says the National Hairdressing Center.
Such a phenomenon is expected to produce life-threatening tulips and smiley streaks, and a landslide in the mountainous terrain.
Norton's Midsomer Attack: Four arrested for attempted suicide
Three boys in their late twenties and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murdering a 16-year-old boy who landed a few times in Somerset.
The boy was found in his late teens and injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital where he was ‘stable’.
A 17-year-old man, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, according to Avon and Somerset Police.
Officers are asking anyone who could have a piece of mobile phone footage of what happened to them.
Trump said about Kavanaugh, that he 'suffered, grumpy, angry' the Democratic Party
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's ruthless tactics and scandals," Trump said in a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh "suffered bitterness, and anger" of the Democratic Party during this nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the Conference on Thursday, and strongly and emotionally denied allegations from Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her twenty or thirty years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing on his allegations.
The president said Saturday that "Americans saw the rise and quality and fragility" of Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to certify Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to certify one of the most capable legal intentions of our time, a lawyer with an excellent public service record," he told followers of West Virginia.
The President indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination as he spoke about the importance of a Republican vote in the midterm elections.
"Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not running, and I'm really running," he said.
"That's why I'm all over the place and I'm fighting for great candidates."
Mr. Trump said he was committed to "refusal and prevention."
The first procedural vote on the Senate floor on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP leadership aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed by the earthquake, Indonesian tsunamis and the number of people killed is increasing.
At least 384 people were killed, and many people and large waves swept across the beaches, when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu Friday when a wave of up to six meters (18 feet) appeared on the shore at nightfall, brushing many of them to death and destroying anything in their way.
The earthquake occurred after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
"When the threat of the tsunami emerged yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and they didn't run immediately and so they were killed," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster relief agency, told AFP.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, saying the tsunami traveled across the open sea at speeds of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the nearby board.
Some people went up on trees to escape from the tsunamis and were saved, he said.
About 16,700 people were displaced to 24 locations in Palu.
In aerial photographs released by the agency, many buildings and shops have been destroyed, complex and broken bridges and mosques and water around them.
They continued to make their way to the city's shores on Saturday.
The series of earthworms has been observed in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indian Agency for Assessment and Implementation of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by the earthquake on Friday was equivalent to about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's geography, located at the end of a long dead bay, could increase the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had fallen.
A number of victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, he said, and said 540 people were injured and 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the shelters and damage could be greater along the 300 km (190 mi) north border from Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Nugroho said "nothing was known at all in the messages" from Donggala.
There are about 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, saying its staff and volunteers were on their way to the sites to be hit.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could become more," she said.
The agency was widely criticised on Saturday for failing to report that the tsunami hit Palu, although officials said waves came in within the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur film piece on social media, a man on the upper floor of a building can be heard giving a scathing warning about the tsunamis that were approaching the people on the street below.
Within a few minutes, a wall of water bursts into the lake, bringing with it buildings and cars.
The trailers of the film were not able to authenticate the piece immediately.
There was a major power outage due to the earthquake and tsunami that cut the communication around Palu, and as a result it was difficult for the authorities to coordinate the rescue efforts.
The army began launching cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, the authorities said, but food and other essentials are still badly needed by displaced people.
The city's airport has been reopened for one-off relief work and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo had planned to visit the resettlement centres in Pal<0xC3><0xBA> on Sunday.
The number of people killed in the Indonesian tsunami has risen to over 800.
It's all sloppy.
Although the World Vision team from Donggala came safely to the city of Palu, where employees are hiding in tarpaulin lockers created in the vicinity of their office, they went over the ruins on the way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses that were destroyed," he said.
It's all ugly.
Even as aid groups began the relief work, many of them complained that a number of foreign aid workers with deep expertise had been prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to the Palu regulations, regulations, funding, supplies and staffing will not flow from overseas until a disaster situation is declared as a national disaster zone.
That hasn't happened yet.
"But it's still a five-level disaster," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'This is a national disaster,' we can open up for international assistance but there is no status yet.
As the second night fell in Palu after the earthquake and the tsunami on Friday, the friends and families of those who were still wanted had hope that their loved ones would become miracles that make the circumstances of the earthquake more natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was taken out of the sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers released a free woman who was in a smiley dress for two days and her mother's body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of Indonesia's national paraphrasing team, coached two of the paraphrasing teams that were in demand for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr Mandagi also said that some of his students were among the others who had been invited to the Roa Roa Hotel.
"As a teenager in the field of paraphrasing, I have my own emotional burden," he said.
Mr Gendon said that, in the moments following the spread of the story of the collapse of Roa Roa Hotel among the parishioners, he had sent a WhatsApp message to Palu's competitors, who were taking part in the beach festival, as he walked out of his tree of power with hymns.
But his messages only resulted in a gray tick, except for a pair of blue ticks.
"I don't think that's going to deliver the message," he said.
$26,750 announced during ATM replenishment at Newport on the Levee
Brink's worker who was recharging the ATM at Newport on the Levee was fined $26,750 on Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was filling in the ATM at the entertainment center and getting ready to deliver more money, which was written by Detective Dennis McCarthy in the issue.
When he was busy, another man "kicked off the back of Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money to be delivered.
Witnesses saw a number of suspects leaving immediately, according to the release, but the police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with knowledge of who they are should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rap musician changed his name to Ye
His name has been changed by rap musician Kanye West - to Ye.
In a tweet on Saturday, he wrote: "The man Kanye West called him before."
West, 41, has been using the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his arrival on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
It will be on the show instead of Ariana Grande who canceled the show for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
In addition to being an abbreviation of the current professional name, West had previously said that the word was of religious importance to him.
I think ‘ye’ is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year, when he was discussing his album title with radio presenter Big Boy.
"So it is you, it is us, it is us.
He changed from Kayne, which means the one person, to Ye - which is a direct expression of our goodness, our evil, our confusion, of everything.
It's more about who we are."
He is one of a number of rap musicians to change his name.
Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy were previously nicknamed Old Combs, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z also made no jokes and no big letters.
Mexico's AMLO pledges not to use the weapon against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed not to end the use of military force in civilian affairs and the country is approaching the 50th anniversary of student-run sales.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "not to use the army to stop the Mexican people."
Troops released a peaceful demonstration at the plaza on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when student movements of the left-wing heat were taking root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has campaigned to support young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who are studying and opening up more public universities for free.
He said that it is due to unemployment and lack of educational opportunities that the youth are attracted to criminal violence.
A.I. funding should be increased by two
With China becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the US should double what it spends on research in that field, said AI researcher and practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at the time for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after different parts of the US government make AI announcements, even if the US does not have a formal AI strategy at all.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year: it aims to be in the 1st place in AI innovation by 2030.
"It would be a good start to double the AI research budget, taking into account that every other country is much further behind than the US, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in AI," Lee said.
By increasing funding by double the chances of the next major AI discovery in the US being doubled as well, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" is published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, POF Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that won the American-ranked Othello player, and later became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese Google branch.
Lee admitted to previous technology competitions by the US government such as the Robotic Challenge Agency of the Defence High Research Projects and asked where the next one would be, to help identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the US often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking away the academic leaders; it's the corporate companies," Lee said.
Leaders from universities working on AI in recent years have been employed by Facebook, Google and other tech companies.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help the U.S. grow under AI efforts as well.
"I think a green card should automatically be offered to PhDs in AI," Lee said.
The State Council of China issued a Development Plan on Artificial Intelligence of the Second Generation in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions such as the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to U.S. researchers, but the quality of the academic work is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Artificial Intelligence Consortium, which partners from industry and academia to participate in, and the White House announced the creation of an Artificial Intelligence Committee.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
For the NSF, it is currently investing more than $100 million in AI research.
Meanwhile, no action has been seen in recent months in U.S. legislation to be supported by the National Security Commission on the creation of Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether or not to change the name of the country
The Macedonian people voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change their name to "North Macedonia" or not, a measure to resolve a dispute that has been going on for twenty or thirty years with Greece that was being blocked in NATO's bid to ban NATO.
Greece, which has a five-member bloc called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbours is a claim on its territory and has banned its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments made a market in June on the basis of the intended name of the village, but national opposition parties claim that the change would remove the base from the ethnic identity of the Slavic overcrowded population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not cast a vote in the referendum and due to a backlash campaign is doubting whether or not the amount of people who will be voting will reach the 50 per cent required for the referendum to be valid.
The question before the referendum was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership to accept the agreement with Greece?"
The people who support the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it's even too big to watch for entry into bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the fall of Yugoslavia.
"Today I came to the future of the country, to the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the shadow of the European Union because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
While it is not legally binding, many members of parliament have said they will stick to the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
A two-thirds majority in parliament voted for the name change.
The state's election commission said there were no reports of irregularities by 1 p.m.
However, only 16 per cent of registered voters voted, compared to 34 per cent in the most recent parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 per cent of registered voters cast their votes.
"I came out to vote because of my children, our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko voted for the referendum in Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September, 2018 on changing the country's name to resolve the way in which to participate in NATO.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small platform, and he was pulling up chairs in front of a pub built by the people who will do baghcat on the referendum.
"We are not in favor of NATO and the EU, but we would like to take membership with pride, and not through the service door," Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us to take them as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and be part of the European-Asian integration."
Prime Minister Zaev said that membership in NATO will provide a very strong investment for Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a very large majority will be in favour because over 80 per cent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
He said that a "favorable" vote would be a "confirmation of our future."
In a public opinion poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters would take part in the referendum - below the required voter turnout.
In another public opinion poll, conducted by Telef<0xC3><0xAD>s Telma of Macedonia, it was found that it was planned by 57 of the respondents to spend Sunday's vote.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote in favour.
In order for the referendum to succeed, the number of votes must be 50 per cent plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be its first serious blow to the Western-backed government's policy since it took power last May.
See: Sergio Aguero makes Manchester City his way through all Brighton defenders for back
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling put Brighton defenders in a 2-0 win at Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's score was very easy in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder got a pass in the middle of the park at the start of the series.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before cutting into the open park.
There were four windows around Aguero.
He pressed about one defender before passing over several other defenders on the edge of the Brighton box.
He then stepped on his left side, coming to Sterling.
England's starter used his first contact in the box to bring the ball back to Aguero, who used his right shoe to get the win on Brighton's backside, Matthew Ryan with a kick into the right-hand side of the field.
"Aguero has some problems with his legs," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about playing it for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored back at that moment."
But it was Steirling who gave the lead advantage to Sky Blues in the Premier League clinching.
This was done in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep into Brighton's ground on that play.
He sent a beautiful ball across the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few contacts before Sterling was led to the tail.
Sky Blues' start hit the ball into the pitch before sliding over the border.
City will face Hoffenheim in the play of the group Sraith na gTuradh at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play spoiler for the Rockies
As the Nationals pulled out of the match-fixing competition, there wasn't much reason to force another start.
But Scherzer is hoping to take the lead on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but if there are only game-fixing implications for the Rockies, who are ahead of one game over the Angeles Dodgers in WL West.
The Rockies won at least a special place with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to win a title in the first division.
"Although we are playing without permission, at least we will be able to put our feet in the series through play and we know that the atmosphere here in Denver will be with the crowd and the other team would be playing probably at the highest level of any point that would be in front of me this year.
Why don't we want to take part in that?"
The Nationals still have a starter to announce for Saturday, but they are said to let Scherzer pitch in such a case usually.
Scherzer, who would be making his 34th start, spent a practice loca session on Thursday and would pitch on his usual Sunday night.
The Washington outfit has 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 crickets in 220 2/3 draws this season.
Trump strikes in West Virginia
The President indirectly referred to the case regarding his choice in Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh while speaking about the importance of a Republican vote in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done is going to be in jeopardy.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections in our lives.
This is one of the big, big things -- I'm not running but I'm really running and that's why I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates," he said.
Trump then said, "You see this radical group of grains, grains, you see it happening right now.
And they are weighed on the power to give back by using all the necessary methods, you see the bitterness, the sadness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they lay down to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we won't give them that."
It is the duty of the Democrats to "reject and block matters."
"And you've seen that for the last four days," he said, giving "angry and grainy and sour and lying" to the Democrats.
He referred to the Seanad Committee of Judges by classifying Sen. Dianne Feinstein as his name, and made the audience very high.
"Do you remember the answer?
Did you get the document?
Uh, uh, what is it.
I didn't leak, uh, I'm waiting for one - that whole body signage was bad - the worst body signage I've ever seen."
The Labour Party no longer represents the Labour Party and the Church as a whole.
They don't speak to those who speak out.
Although the Momentum activists voted in my local party to condemn me, it was no surprise.
After all, I'm the latest in a line of Labour Party MPs that I've been told isn't welcome next - that's all the shock we talked about.
She spent almost the same as my colleague Joan Ryan because she stood steadfastly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the complaint resolution taxed me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, on Europe, issues, in perpetuity, Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement to the Nottingham East Working People's Party meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be comprehensive and productive."
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, that's exactly how Friday's GC meetings were.
Unfortunately today, that's not the atmosphere in many of the meetings and has long since forgotten the promise of a "more kind, sexier" politics if it ever really started.
It is becoming ever more obvious that there is no acceptance of different views in the Labour Party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party's leadership or not.
That started shortly after Jeremy was made leader, as there were colleagues I had previously thought to have a similar political view of us, hoping that we would make a change from the ground up and take positions that we do not agree with any other than that - regardless of whether or not the opposition.
Any time I speak in public - and no matter what I say - a bad temper on social media will want to bias, condemning middle-class politics, telling me I shouldn't be a Labour Party member.
And that's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments I'm directed at are usually about political matters.
I am touched by the professionalism and tenacity of those colleagues who have to put up with the power of sexual misconduct or bullying every day without ceasing to back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the way in which bad levels are now being accepted.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Worker's Party should nurture a culture of mourning.
The truth is that we are no longer that broad church and with every resolution of "confidence" or change in election rules the party is becoming closer.
A lot of advice has been given to me over the past two years praising me for not paying attention to myself, not talking out as much and then saying "right enough."
But I didn't go with the policy to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school employee, which was inspired by the failures of the Thatcher government who left my comprehensive school classroom falling to the ground at home, I have sought to campaign for better public services for those who care as much as they care for those who care for them.
I've never had a vote, including in the last election.
It wouldn't come as a surprise to anyone in Nottingham East about my policy stance and areas I didn't agree with on the current leadership.
For those who put forward the resolution on Friday, the only thing I would say is that when the country moves for Brexit that will harm families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the party leader.
But really, the only message I have is not about Nottingham Momentum, but it's about my constituents, whether they're Labour members or not: I'm proud to serve them and I promise that political intimidation or harassment won't stop me from acting in a good way.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr won't be beaten to the top
Two of those flaws may have contributed the final result to the content leaks, but there's no doubt that Ayr's Tennants' main game of the day was very entertaining to win.
They are now at the top of the table, the only team out of ten that hasn't won.
In the end, their defense was excellent, as well as the way they took chances, which helped the home team and coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
"We've tried our games so far, but we still haven't won, so I have to be happy," he said.
Robyn Christie de Melrose said: "Our praise to Ayr, they took better chances than we did."
This put Grant Anderson's in the 14th minute, which saved Frazier Climo, Ayr to the front, but, due to the yellow card of Albanian player Rory Hughes, who released Warriors for the game, Melrose was able to take advantage of the nets and Jason Baggot's net.
Climo scored Ayr's start with a penalty kick, before, just at half-time, he scored and then saved a pitch from foot to hand to make it 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
But Melrose started the second half well and with this Patrick Anderson, who saved Baggot, the gap was reduced to five points.
There was a long delay due to a serious injury to Roaring Knott, who was brought from the park on a stretcher, and from the start, Ayr pushed on flooding through that Stafford McDowall, who saved Climo.
Active captain Ayr Blair Macpherson received a yellow card then, and again, Melrose brought the extra man to pay off with the undefeated Bruce Colvine at the end of a wave of fierce pressure.
The home team returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card from attacking Climo without the ball, from extending the penalty chic, MacPherson landed at the back of Ayr's chest moving forward.
Climo, as he had been doing since almost restarting, after Kyle Rowe collected a high kick over his shoulder David Armstrong and put the backsman Gregor Henry away for the fifth of the home team.
It seems that the game is still going to be a new profession in the restaurant industry.
It seems that the star Still Game Ford Kiernan will be moving to the hospitality industry after discovering that he has been named as the director of the licensed restaurant company.
Ford's 56-year-old role as Jack Jarvis on the much-loved BBC show, a show he writes with his long-time partner Greg Hemphill and which he shares with.
The two announced that their ninth series will be coming up on the final one during the show, and it looks like Kiernan is planning a life change after Craiglang.
According to official record lists, Adriftmorn Limited is the director.
The actor declined to make a statement about the story, although a source from the Scottish Sun noted that Kiernan wanted to be involved in a "successful restaurant trade" for Glaschu<0xC3><0xBA>.
‘We are the sea’: the thalamiata Bolivian hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines patrol a quarter of a fleet equipped with rigs in La Paz.
There is an ocean-shaped flag on public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are dotted with the mana: "We are the sea from right.
It is our duty to get it back."
Throughout the land-locked Bolaive, the memory of losing its continents against Chile in a flood of resources in the 19th century is still clear - as well as the arrival of the Pacific Ocean once again.
That hope has been at its peak for the past twenty or thirty years, and Bulgaria is waiting for a ruling from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of debate.
"Bolav has a momentum, a spirit of unity and tranquility, and of course she expects the result to be positive," said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolaive's ambassador.
Many Bolavachs will be watching the CBI's control of large screens across the country, and they are bold enough that the tribunal in The Hague will be in favour of Bolaive's demand - following heated talks over the past twenty or thirty years - that it is the responsibility of the Chileans to negotiate and negotiate the deal.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's alluring indigenous president - who has a controversial battle ahead for next year's re-election - is also heavily dependent on Monday's rule.
"We are very close to going back to the Pacific," he promised at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not decide in favor of Bolivia - and little change would be made if it decided in its favor.
The United Nations body based in the Netherlands has no power to grant the end of Chile, and has ordered it not to determine the outcome of possible talks.
Due to the fact that the CBI regulation comes six months immediately after hearing the final arguments, "the case was not complicated," said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Silesian expert in international law.
And not only was the cause of the Bolaive continued, but it may have been postponed for the past four years.
"The current administrations of Bolivia have taken possession of the issue of access to the sea," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales's aggressive shelling made any good-will that would have been left by Chile's capture.
Bulgaria and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be very difficult to hold a discussion afterwards.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, the representative of the Bolaive at The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was more flawed than it usually is.
"There will be a great opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" on Monday and a chance to "end the 139-year-old agreements with a consensus," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most ardent presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political backer.
"Bolaiv will not give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean," he said.
"It's an opportunity to see that we have to overcome history."
North Korea has said that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can be trusted in the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation would not first denuclearize its nuclear weapons if it did not have confidence in Washington.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to act in accordance with his words on the promises made during a summit meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the opposing sides.
His remarks come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart a nuclear diplomacy that was halted more than three months after a Singapore meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.
He said it was a "dream" that continued sanctions and a refusal of the US to declare an end to the North Korean War would end in a deadlock.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration if Pyongyang does not take the first significant disarmament measures.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want to have another summit.
But there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is actually refusing to arm itself in a way that the country seems to see as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for another summit meeting between Kim and Trump.
In a fashion show in Paris, the latest line is shown in huge measures that are on the way to Grands Boulevards near you
If you want to make your hat collection more or block the sun completely, you no longer need to do a search.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a huge headspace for their SS19 collection on the exhibition platform with its effect on the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
There were a lot of very unpractical hats being shown around Instagram this summer and those designers put their incredible work on the manicure platform.
In the visible part with Valentino there is an oversized beige hat on which is a wide sheet like the wings of a claw claw of the gloves.
Other huge adaptations included jewelled water ornaments, a dredger hat and even a duck - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Browne revealed a strange mask selection as well-in time for November.
Many of the colored masks had wrinkled lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One work was similar to scrubbing equipment, snorkels and swimming glasses, and some of them were similar to melted ice cream cones.
And if you follow the fashion statement, you're in luck.
It is predicted by style observers that it may be making its way by the big losers to the big streets near you.
The huge hats come shortly after 'La Bomba', the brown hat on which has a two-foot-wide sheet that can be seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the very impractical hat that was being displayed across social media put another big work on the manicure platform - a beach bag that is almost as big as the manikin on which the swimming suit is carrying it.
The burnt orange raffia bag, which had a raffia french dressing and white leather straps, was the visible piece in the SS19 collection of Jacquemus' La Riviera Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect big beach hats and bags to come to the big street for the next summer - since the designer had so much influence it would be hard to ignore all of the accessories.
John Edwards: Language skills that are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, and this was followed in 2018 by another series of excellent exam results, which are enhanced by the success of individuals and each other in sport, art, music and other community endeavours.
And over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to students and their parents.
It is the aim of independent schools to prepare their students for further education and higher education, for the profession they choose and for their place as global citizens.
As an education sector where we can design and implement a customized school curriculum, we are seeing that modern languages are becoming popular and that they are a preferred choice of mined materials in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, that goes to his heart."
That's a strong reminder that we can't rely on English if we want to nurture relationships with people from other countries and have confidence in them.
From the latest exam results this year, we see that languages at the top of the tables are stacked with the highest pass rates in independent schools.
Sixty-eight percent of the students who studied in foreign languages earned an Honors degree.
The data, collected from 74 SCIS membership schools, showed that 72 per cent of the Honorary Degree students in Mandarin, and 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied Spanish and 63 per cent of those who studied English, had achieved a degree in English.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed for children and young people in the future.
Languages are now seen as a choice of subjects, as viewed on STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent school curricula and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Employment and Skills Commission found that 17 per cent of employers had difficulty filling a job because of a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future careers.
And languages are needed for more prospective job opportunities, these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the profession chosen by a person, if they have learned the second language, they will have a real advantage in the future that they have a life-long skill similar to this skill.
By being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a multilingual person will be promoted to the competitors automatically.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 UK adults in 2013, 75 per cent of them were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation and France was the only language to have a digital percentage of them, 15 per cent.
That's why it's important for kids today to invest in language learning.
If children have more than one language, especially those in a developing-mouthed economy, they will be more likely to get a decent job.
Different languages will be taught in each school in Albania.
Some schools will focus on the most classic contemporary languages, and other schools will teach the languages considered to be the most important languages for the UK to look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest, there will always be some languages to choose from within independent schools, with a teaching team of specialists in this field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills to succeed, no matter what happens in the future.
It cannot be denied at this time, in a global business environment, that languages are still vital to the future of the country, so that must be reflected in education.
In fact, languages should really be looked at as "international communication skills."
Independent schools will continue to offer this option, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Independent Schools Council.
LeBron will play his first Sunday Lakers game in San Diego.
The wait is so close for trailers to see LeBron James in his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the first game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the number of minutes it will play is still a decision.
"It's going to be more than a minute and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-week Lakers pre-season schedule.
"There are no pre-season games at this point in my career to prepare for," he said.
Trump was shot in West Virginia, Channel You Tube
The President, Donald Trump, is launching a number of strikes today at Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five closures over the coming week, including stops in friendly locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote for the one who elected him to the run-off in the Supreme Court being reserved, Trump plans to get support for the mid-term elections because there is a risk that Republicans will lose control of their position in the Federal Parliament, when the Samhain 2 vote is cast.
What time will Virginia West Trump's strike take place today and how can we look at it online?
Trump struck at Wheeling, West Virginia to take place at 7 p.m. Eastern Time, today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's campaign in West Virginia live online on You Tube.
Trump is likely to speak about the hearings that are taking place regarding Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee. The hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct was tense. Seanad’s confirmed vote has been put on hold for a week while the investigation is underway.
But the main goal of the next week's series of strikes is to help Republicans, who are facing intense competition, speed up their campaign.
So, President Trump's campaign indicated that these five moves during the coming week were aimed at "encouraging the volunteer workers and supporters to protect and increase their presence in the Senate and the House of Commons," according to Reuters.
"The control of the Conference is so essential to its program that the president will visit as many states as he can, as the busy campaign season progresses," a spokesman for the Trump campaign, who did not give his name, told Reuters.
Minister Wesbanco's overnight trip to Wheeling is set to attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and get publicity from the media in Pittsburgh," according to Metro News, West Virginia.
Trump will be visiting West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 points in 2016, for the second time in a month.
Trump is seeking help from West Virginia Republican candidate for the Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is behind the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has come to try to make a difference in public opinion," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Corn Ryder 2018 The SAM Team shows that they are eager to be hopeful ahead of Sunday's single rounds.
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday's fourth game may have been what was needed from this Ryder Horn.
The concept of a sport made up is the momentum of the moment, but the players strongly believe in it, especially at competitions like this.
So where's the momentum now, do you think?
"It was a point forward and now it's reduced to four points, so there's a little bit of a moment for us, I guess," Jordan Spieth said as he went for the day.
Europe, of course, has an advantage, which is four points to the front and twelve points to play.
The Americans, however, are hopeful and very hopeful, especially because Spieth and Justin Thomas are playing well, together, throughout the day and can claim to have won by three points out of four.
Spieth has been playing wonderfully from house to house and is setting a good example.
The snarling cries of the celebratory turned out higher as the round went on; he found the necessary effort to win a game of his four, when he and Thomas were two to one after two holes.
The excitement he got the game at 15 and let go of the tears, the kind that tells you that the American team has not lost the tournament.
"You have to keep your conscience and focus on your own game," Spieth said.
That's what's left for every player now.
18 points to get rid of.
The two players, who have more points than Spieth and Thomas, are over the two days that went by than Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood and this is the great story of Horn Ryder.
Four out of four Europeans have won a pair, who are poor but happy and can't do anything wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple who didn't hit oxen on Saturday night, but avoided oxen, as well, on Saturday morning, Friday night and the second nine o'clock in the morning of Friday.
The match without a level they played and the way in which they get energy from the glamorous audience shows that both of them are the players who will have to win on Sunday; and no player would be more generous to achieve a European victory by winning the National by Golf.
It would be better if both of them would win out at the same time, but at different holes.
But it is too soon to talk about European glory.
It didn't take long for Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson to get the victory over Sergio Garcia, the morning hero of the four balls, and Alex Noren, his partner. The Spaniards and the Swedes were in a hole and they couldn't escape.
The Spaniards and the Swedes were in a hole and were unable to escape after receiving boules and two doubles in the first nine holes.
On Sunday, however, there's no one to help you escape from a hole you've sat in.
The four balls and the four game are so attractive, if viewed sharply, because of the interaction between the pieces, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way in which strategy changes in the eyesight.
Europe has played better as a team to this point and they are going well into the final day, but this fourth game showed that the US Team is passionate about fighting, although there were doubts about some people, especially in the United States.
Europe is at the beginning of the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will have a good advantage at the beginning of the final day of the Ryder Cup after the four balls and the four-game, when they were ahead of the United States 10-6.
The two exciting, Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, were leading the battle when they had two victories over Tiger Woods, who was struggling, to reach four points to that point at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European team, who were looking for the corner, lost at Hazeltine two years ago to win again, against the losing American team, in the four balls. He left the series at 3-1.
The U.S. team had a strong presence in the four balls; they beat two games but were unable to reduce the deficit.
Eight points were needed from Jim Furyk's team from Sunday's singles matches to keep the corner.
Fleetwood is the first European goalkeeper to win four points in a row and he and Molinari, who was named ‘Molliwood’ after the weekend, are the second pair to win four points in the four opening games in the history of Horn Ryder.
They had a big win over Woods and Patrick Reed in the four balls and played two as a unit to win over Woods, who was weak, and Bryson Dechambeau with an even better win, with 5 and 4.
Woods who had been struggling in two games on Saturday, played again very much now but 19 of 29 games, which he played, he has now lost in the four balls and in the four games and he has lost seven games in a row now.
Justin Rose took a break when the four balls went off in the morning and played again with his partner, Henrik Stenson, in the four-and-a-half games of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, who are set to become the world's first and third golfer.
It wasn't easy in Europe, however, on a pleasant day, it will be west of Paris.
Jordan Spieth, who won the majors three times, and Justin Thomas, set the standard for the Americans when they beat two points on Saturday.
They won the victory they had won outright against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four balls and subsequently returned to win Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3 in the four balls, though they lost the first two holes.
It only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Horn that a team came back from a four-point deficit in the singles competition, although Furyk's team only needed to be on a co-scorer to keep the horn, because the horn was beaten last year.
After being in second place for two days, however, they are unlikely to be able to make an attack on the Sunday.
North Korea says there is no ‘probability’ that they will unilaterally disarm because of lack of confidence.
North Korea's Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were adding to their lack of confidence in the United States and that there was no way the country would unilaterally give up the nuclear weapons it had.
Ri Yong Ho told the General Assembly of the United Nations that North Korea has shown a "very good magnitude" over the past year, in so far as it has stopped nuclear tests and missile tests, it has taken the site of nuclear tests apart and has failed to conduct nuclear tests.
"But we don't see any similar response from the United States," he said.
"Without any confidence from the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and in these circumstances, there is no way we will unilaterally disarm, at first sight."
Although North Korea has repeatedly complained about the United States, which has opposed a "consecutive" approach to nuclear disarmament, in which North Korea would be given a concession, as it took small steps, it was an important step in the development of its strategic vision.
A reference to a conversation that Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump issued at the first summit between the U.S. President, who was still in office, and the leader of North Korea in Singapore on June 12, when Kim vowed to work "to achieve nuclear disarmament" in the face of Trump.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons in advance.
Washington has also opposed an application to ease the severe international sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists that "nuclear disarmament will first be carried out" and it increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve the goal of their concern in a coherent way, and even opposes "notice of the war to be over," Ri said.
"The idea that we can impose sanctions is an idea from people we don't know.
But the problem is that sanctions, which are continuing, are adding to the lack of confidence we have.
There has been no mention of another summit between Kim and Trump, the U.S. leader said at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister emphasized three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, over the past five months and also said, "If South Korea other than the United States were the party involved in this issue of nuclear disarmament, nuclear disarmament would have been a matter of great concern."
However, the way in which Kim spoke to him in his very different speech from last year, when he told the United Nations General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korea's missiles would detonate on U.S. soil after Trump's "manicure", "Mr.
This year, at the United Nations, Trump praised Kim for the courage he had to take steps to de-arm, although last year he threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea. However, he said there would still be a lot of work to be done to make sure that no one is left behind.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a certain amount of time for disarmament, saying, "if it takes two years, three years or five years - it doesn't matter."
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should compensate Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
But Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State, told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the sanctions of the Security Council must be applied vigorously and without any failure until nuclear disarmament is fully achieved and certified."
The U.N. Security Council has tightened sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to stop funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but hasn't done too well with the last visit he made.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made; but North Korea taxed him within a few hours because he made "claims about how to do it."
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month that it would destroy the presence of a missile, if the United States took "corresponding measures."
He said Kim told him that the "corresponding measures" he had taken were Trump's security promises in Singapore and taking steps to achieve normal relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course to get enough rest.
A new course at Harvard University has started this year to have more sleep at each sub-stage to counter the growing, angry culture in which studies are conducted overnight with the help of caffeine."
A student found that students at the university, who are in the first place in the world, have no opinion on how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, put the course together. He believes this course is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was encouraged to start the course after he talked about the effect of a lack of sleep on learning.
‘At the end of the lecture, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why haven’t I been told this before, and I’m in my senior year?’
She said no one has ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me," he told the Telegraph.
The course, which was made available for the first time this year, explains to students the key points regarding good sleep habits and the way in which they help with academic performance and athletics, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and an executive director of the university's medical services, said the university made a decision to introduce the course, when he found that students were very sleep-deprived during the week.
A series of interactive tasks are part of the hour-long course.
In one section, there is an image of sleeplessness, in which students pinch coffee cups, spoons, exercise shoes and books to get an answer to the effects of caffeine and light and the way in which sleep deprivation has an effect on the exercise of leisure time.
In another section, people who take part are told the way in which sleep deprivation, which is long-term, can increase the risk of developing heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
Then a map of the campus bursts with interactive illustrations, the people who take part to reflect on their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe that they have the right to be informed- about how you would have the right to be informed about the health effects that smoking would have on you," Professor Czeisler said.
There’s still a culture of “staying in your seat during the night,” he said. According to him, modern technology and the pressure on students mean, which is constantly increasing that the lack of sleep is an increasing problem.
A student should make sure he has enough good-quality sleep as a ‘secret tool’, he said, to avoid stress, upset and anxiety, even to avoid weight gain, as a lack of sleep puts the brain in a mode of hunger, as it has a tendency to overeat.
Raymond So, 19, from California, who is studying chemistry and biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course, after taking one of his classes during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and that he crossed it to look for a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to question all the sub-steps of a similar study program, before it enters the competitive institution.
The Professor suggested that students should set an alarm at bedtime, as well as an alarm at wake-up time and be aware of the ill effects of ‘blue light’ coming from electronic screens and from LED lights. They can perform their daily rhythm of waking up and waking up.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's Men's
Rangers again lost out of town as, due to the backlash Menga received, defeated the disorganized Steven Gerrard team 1-0 at Livingston.
Ibrox's team wanted to get the first win out of town, since they won 4-1 at St Johnstone in February. But Gary Holt's team won them, the second breaking on Gerrard out of 18 games as manager. Due to which, Gerrard's team has eight points to last on Hearts, the team in LaPred's big tors.
Menga hit the back seven minutes before halftime and there was no likelihood that Rangers, who were uninspired, would succeed in scoring.
As long as Rangers have fallen to sixth place, Livingston has risen to third place and there is only a difference in the backs between them.
More trouble may be in store for Rangers, after the online man, Calum Spence, found a cure for a head injury from some material thrown from the side of the home audience, according to appearances.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that easily beat Ayr to find a place in the half-race of the Betfred Corner.
On the other hand, Holt retained the same 11 player, who took a point from Hearts the previous week and would be very happy with the way in which his team well-trained the opponent's wife.
Rangers may have had possession of the ball for the most part but Livingston had more to do with the possession they found.
Livingston should have scored after two minutes, when Menga passed the ball to Scott Pitman, who gave a kick towards the back of Allan McGregor but went on a pitch.
Keegan Jacobs took a free-kick that went to Captain Craig Halkett but did not succeed with his defensive partner Alan Lithgow with his chic just to put it on the forums.
Rangers took control of the game, but it seemed that they had hope rather than faith in the type of play they were playing, in the final third of the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought that he had earned an Erice kick after a quarter of an hour, when he hit Steven Lawless but the solver Steven Thomson did not accept the pleas of a Columbia man.
Rangers only managed to put two chics towards the back but Ibrox's former back, Liam Kelly, had no difficulty breaking Lassana Coulibaly's header and a weak kick from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's kick may have been in the 34th minute against the pitch pattern, it can't be denied that they didn't deserve it because they had made an over-exertion.
Rangers again failed to deal with a fixed item in the beginnings from Jacobs.
Scot Arfield did not respond to his pass from Declan Gallagher to Scott Robinson, who remained calm and gave a pass to Menga, who put it in the back.
Gerrard acted at the break, when he traded Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and had an immediate impact at the change as he passed to Morelos, who hit him in the back but pushed Kelly, who had a great game, from his line to overtake the ball.
But Livingston continued to entice the visitors to play the type of game they liked. Lithgow and Halkett continued to hit the ball up the park over and over again.
Holt's team may have an extra score towards the end of the game but McGregor stood the ground well to overtake Jacobs and gave Lithgow a header from a corner chic that went on the forums.
Rangers representative Glenn Middleton had a late claim to Eric's chic when he had an argument with Jacobs but again, Thomson, the solver, looked in the other direction.
Almanac: Inventor of Geiger.
And now a page from our German "Sunday Morning": 30 September, 1882, 136 years ago today.....the day the future physicist, Johannes Wilhelm, "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for finding and measuring radioactivity, a finding from which the device known as the Geiger Controller was made.
Geiger is a cornerstone of science since then. A cornerstone of pop culture was also made. In the 1950s, there was a film starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. Although not expected, they were scientists in the film:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It is a Geiger Inventor, which is used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the fumes caused by the radioactivity released from the minerals."
Evans: "Yeah, he's definitely clapping now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the name is still there.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ squamous cells.
The new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to ‘see’ and kill squamous cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize wart cells as part of a cure-all.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can then ‘see’ proteins that are common in many cancers and then are re-injected.
A trial vaccine is showing promising results in patients, who have different types of cancer.
In the case of one woman who was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system how to identify wart cells, the entire ovarian cancer went away for 18 months.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can ‘see’ proteins, which are common in many types of cancer, and called HER2 and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results indicate that we have a vaccine that we are very hopeful about."
"Several types of cancer grow" due to HER2, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and cholera, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach worked, in which patients' immune cells were built and "taught" how to target cancer cells to treat a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West began disbanding on behalf of Trump, and Hata MAGA was wearing it after he was on SNL.
It didn't work well for him.
Kanye West was hit in the studio after Saturday Night Live gave a release show in which he suggested the United States and President Donald Trump, who would stand for office in 2020, according to him.
When he didn't sing the third song Ghost Town gave him, he was wearing a MAGA (Make America Great Again) hat. He started by slamming the Democrats and reasserting his support for Trump.
"I talk so often to a white man who says: 1. How could you give Trump interest, don't you insult him?
Well, if I were worried about race, I'd have moved away from America," he said.
SNL began the show with a magical sketch by Matt Damon, in which the star of Holywood made a mockery of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault, made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, the comedian, Chris Rock, uploaded Kanye West's music on social media.
It's not clear if Rock wanted to joke about West with the post.
In addition, the audience had complained that he was being loved in the backcountry for the same action he was taking.
"They beat me in the back.
They said, ‘Then don’t go out with that hat on.’
They've pissed me off!
And then they say I'm in a low place," according to the Washington Examiner.
West followed him: "Do you want to see the low place?" He said "that it would put a superman cab on him because that means you can't give me an order. Do you want the world to move on?
trying to find love."
He was hit twice, at least, because of what he said and appeared to be disgraced staff members, <0xC2><0xA7><0xC2><0xA7><0xC2><0xA7> reported Variety; one person told the magazine; "The whole studio was silent."
West was brought on the show as a late representative for singer Ariana Grande, whose former stockbroker, rap musician Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West put a lot of people through an exhibition of the song ‘I Love It’ and dressed it up as a Perrier Bottle.
The head of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner gave support to West in a tweet: "For one of the most courageous people: Thank you for standing up for the democracy movement."
But presenter of the talk show, Karen Hunter, tweeted that Kanye West was "understood as he is and that's great."
"But I choose not to compensate a person (who buys his music or supports his 'art') who, I think, accepts and embraces ideological disenfranchisement that harms my own community.
It's free.
"We are, too," he said.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that his official name was now Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows Diddy's example, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The name Snoop Lion has its rap co-singer, Snoop Dog and, of course, the famous musician, Prince, does not last, changed his name to symbolicIl and then to the artist Prince was already named.
A prosecution for an attempted murder in a restaurant in Belfast's Belfast City.
A forty-five-year-old man was charged with attempted murder, when a man sat in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in the town of Hakamar, which was announced by the police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the District Court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutions will be examined by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks a nemesis.
Kit Harington is best known for his swordsmanship role as Jon Snow in the medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, who is 31 years old, has stereotypes of the heroic hero, saying that parts of that kind on the screen mean that young boys often think they have to be tough in order to appreciate them.
Speaking to ‘Sunday Times Culture’, Kit said he believes ‘something has gone wrong’ and asked how to deal with the problem of nemesis in the <0xE2><0x99><0xAF>MeToo era.
Kit, whose co-star on Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, who is 31 years old, recently admitted that he feels strongly about dealing with the issue.
‘Personally, I feel strongly at the moment – where do we go on a street with a personality?’ he said.
‘What lessons did we teach men when they were growing up, in terms of the problems we see now?’
Kit believes that perhaps the television is responsible, to a certain extent, for the increase in moodiness, thanks in that for the characters that are extremely masculine.
He continued, "What is native and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets, it suggests to young boys that they must be sure before they grow up.
I think that's one of the big questions of the day - how do we change that?
It's clear that something has gone wrong for young men."
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be taking part in any prequels or follow-up stories, when the series ends next summer, saying ‘there are no more cat and horse parks of him’.
From November, Kit will have a major role in the revival of True West Sam Shepard. This is a story about a film producer and his brother's story, which is his motto.
The actor recently revealed that he thought the best thing that came out of Game of Thrones was that he met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife on this show and so she gave me my children and my life in the future,” he said.
Rose took part in Ygritte, whose character Kit, Jon Snow, fell in love with her in the fantasy series, which won an Emmy.
The couple married in June 2018 in the estate of Leslie's family in Scotland.
Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)/ Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
Medical officials say the disease is in excess of 820,000 in the country.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases were spread through sex, a change from the previous story.
Traditionally, HIV spreads rapidly through parts of China, due to infected blood transfusions.
But there is a huge reduction in the number of people who get HIV like this and, inevitably, anyone is getting it like this now, Chinese medical officials in Yunnan province said.
However, from year to year, there is an increase of 100,000 people, who have HIV and AIDS.
It is a crucial issue in China's Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LADT) community for the spread of HIV through sex.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but it is said that discrimination against the LADT community is widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies show that 70%-90% of men, who have sex with men, eventually marry women.
A lot of the spread of the disease occurs from sexual protection, which is lacking in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to have a full supply of HIV drug to try to deal with the problem.
Maxine Waters denies being a member of the GOP’s senior data team and denigrates ‘dangerous lies and conspiracy theories’.
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters alleged on Saturday that a member of his own team leaked personal information about three Republican senators in the United States or that the team member posted the information on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat reported that the information was being promoted by ‘real-life’ commentators and web sites.
"Lies, lies and more grainy lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
U.S. Senators, Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah, were reported to have included home addresses and phone numbers among the information provided.
The information was made available online on Thursday. It was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during your Seanaid panel's examination of allegations of sexual misconduct, filed against the person, who had been named to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
The information leak was made available sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Custodian sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP addresses identified that the source of the mails was related to the Waters office" and that the information about a member of the Waters staff was provided by the Hill reported.
"It's a total lie," said Waters.
The staff member - whose identity, personal information and security have been provided, due to these allegations, who is fraudulent and false - was not responsible in any way for leaking this information.
It's completely unfounded, it's completely unfounded."
Waters' statement was immediately denounced online. Among the people whose tax was a former White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer.
"It's very frustrating," Fleischer wrote.
This suggests that she is not fit to be a member of the Congress.
When something is said to someone who has not done it, he should not be angry.
It shouldn't be challenging.
He should not question the reasons given by the prosecution.
He needs to be calm and calm.
The similarity was that Fleischer was making a comparison between Waters' response to the Democratic's condemnation of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of looking too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro is a Republican candidate who is standing in the election to win Waters' seat in the midterm elections; he also voiced his views on Twitter.
"It's a big thing, if it's true," he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his office "has informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about the fraudulent claims.
"We will make sure that the people who are guilty are exposed," she continued, "and that they are responsible for their activities, which are inscrutable and insidious to all members of my team."
Johnny English is doing Business Again - a spin-off of Rowan Atkinson's spying without a hitch.
It is now traditional to see whether Brexit is important in any new film that has a British tendency and it appears that this is in the context of this revival of the Johnny English franchise, which relates to divorce on the act in the form of a joke. It began in 2003 with Johnny's reggae in English and Johnny's reggae in English.
Will the language itself be at stake, as terrible as we are, as a new export right for the nation?
In any case, Johnny English has again obtained a license with the Bulgarian eyes to make a mess of matters. His name indicates that there is a joke character created for the people who attend the cinema in the countries that do not speak English.
It is, of course, the secretive, crafty agent, who has risen to the top, who thinks it is enticing, but is similar to Clouseau, a combination of Mr. Bean and the person who provided a single note to the theme Cariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
It's based from the beginning on the traveller and the international, mysterious man Atkinson took part in Barclaycard's television ads at the time, but is now forgotten in which he left everything in its true sense behind.
There are a few good points in this film, the latest JE.
I was very proud of Johnny English as he walked towards the helicopter as long as he's dressed in a medieval knight's carriage and the rotors hitting against his clock at one point.
Atkinson's victory for the body comedy is apparent, but the comedy is real-laugh and excessive, especially, because film brands such as James Bond and Mission Impossible now offer comedy as part of the films.
It seems that the joke is aimed at children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's soap opera mishap is not as humorous and focused as the Mr Bean-shaped joke in Atkinson's silent films.
The bottom line now is that the Great Britain has a big problem.
A cyber-watcher has slipped into the secret web of British spies and the names of British agents are leaked. This adds eloquence to the duty-bound agent very little, unfortunately, to Kevin Eldon.
The defeat of the disaster that exists for your chief, a major cause, is under pressure; already, there is a complete breakdown in the face of the public: Emma Thompson makes a fool of the character, who is similar to Teresa-May, but can not do much with the script.
Her advisers inform her that the name of each spy is leaked and that she must find someone who has emerged from it.
And this is Johnny English ineffective. He is currently employed in a secure place, but he is giving classes, in secret mode, about how to be your secret agent. There are some jokes here because English is an offer to get a spy academy of a Rock and Roll kind.
English is taken back to Whitehall for an emergency information session and reunites with his ex-partner, Bough, whom Ben Miller takes that part again.
Bough is now a married man, he is married to a captain on a submarine, part of a small submarine, in which Vicki Pepperdine is too much.
So, Batman and Robin, who get everything wrong in the Queen's Secret Service, are back in action. They meet Ophelia Bulletova, an attractive, beautiful woman, who is Olga Kurylenko who takes the part.
Meanwhile, a tech-savvy billionaire who demands he can solve Britain's computer problems is the prime minister under threat. Jason Volta is a malicious person and Jake Lacy takes part.
English and Bough embark on a mundane adventure of witchcraft: while dressed as waiters, they set a French galley restaurant on fire; they create a beating bull while boarding a galley of Volta, secretly; English creates a fool's errand, when he tries to use it
They do their seven tries for the final item, but while it's eye-catching and exciting, the TV look of the kids is on the whole thing.
It's quite a moderate subject.
And about how it's with other Johnny English films, I ran the idea: can the British film industry take part in Rowan Atkinson, which suits his ability?
The Labour Party denies that it is planning a four-day working week for British workers but that they will be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is to consider a radical plan, in which Britons will work for four days a week, but will be paid for five days.
It is reported that the party wants the leaders of the bodies to give money, which they will save through the revolution of artificial intelligence (IS), to the workers in the form of an extra day off.
The workers would have a three-day weekend - but they would still have the same pay.
Sources said the idea for the party’s economic programme and its plans to change the country in favour of the workers would be ‘perfect’.
The Confederation of Trade Unions has agreed to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: ‘A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not take place overnight, but a four-day workweek is a goal, which suits the party’s approach to giving an advantage to the worker and the party’s industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party is not the first group to agree with that idea, as the Green Party spent a four-day working week during the campaign in the 2017 General Election.
The Labour Party, however, generally does not agree with the goal at present.
A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘The party’s work week policy is not four days and the party is not considered.’
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of the Labour Party's conference to express the vision he had for a social revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he had a firm resolve to take power from ‘unnamed directors’ and ‘profit-makers’ at utility companies.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans mean that current water scarcity holders will not get their full share of the water bodies as the Labour government could take ‘reductions’, on the grounds that something had been done wrong.
He also confirmed plans to give places to workers on body boards and to create Inclusive Equity Funds and give 10 per cent of the shares in the body to employees, who are likely to receive annual dividends of <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, says with "60 Minutes" whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds or not.
The final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court has been delayed by at least a week, due to the FBI's inquiry into allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. It raises the question of the decision of the Bureau and whether its elders could testify to the Republican Party and whether or not the Senate could not pass a resolution on the matter.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday on "60 Minutes," Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham's correspondents Scott Pelley asked if the FBI could find any information that would alter their minds about him.
Kennedy seemed to have a more open mind than his South Carolina counterpart had.
"Of course I do," said Kennedy.
"Durez and I are going into the hearing, dure, I have spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
He called after this thing happened, after the allegation came out and asked him, ‘Did you do it?’
He was strong, unyielding, he didn't put a finger on it."
However, it seems that Graham's vote is certain.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take serious allegations," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but this is what I know: Brett kept denying it," Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And not everyone who has named her can make sure of it.
He is 36 years old.
I don't think it will change anything."
What is the World Citizen's Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This small Saturday, New York City will host the World Citizens' Festival, an annual event, which has big stars to say their part in and a mission that is extremely important, as well: to end global poverty.
This is the seventh year of the World Citizen's Festival and there will be thousands of people pulling for the Great Festival in Central Park to take advantage of musicians such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes but also, to draw attention to the determined aim of the event, that is to put a stop to it.
International Advocacy, which seeks to end poverty by increasing the number of people who are fighting strongly against it, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, which began in 2012 and is part of the project.
To get free tickets to the event (if you're not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to do some tasks, or "acts" such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, making a phone call, or using any other useful way to spread their knowledge.
How successful was the World Citizen and 12 years left to achieve the goal?
The real way is to give a free concert as a gift to people to tie them to action, or is it just another example such as "the click" - people assuming that they are making a real difference when they sign an online petition or if they send two?
Since 2011, The World Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, who are seeking to advance various goals.
He says these actions have helped harness global leaders to make promises and advance policies, which are worth more than $37 billion to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, at least $10 billion has been donated or collected as part of a fundraising activity.
The group believes that the money received has had a direct impact, already, on the need for 649 million people around the world.
Some of the commitments made are The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of thousands of investors and people who make commitments. It is based in the United Kingdom. It is committed to "helping children to develop their resources, according to their ability" and to pledge their $ in pledges.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and World Citizens like yourself, we can put an end to the social injustice that is under way," said Tracy Ullman, Ambassador of the Power of Food, to the crowd during the 2018 concert.
The group also said, after more than 5,000 actions have been taken, calling on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced a fund for projects, the Food Power, that will help pay for 5 million women and girls.
In response to one of the FAQs on the website, which asks the question "why do you think we can end real poverty?
The World Citizen replied: "There will be a long, difficult road ahead - from time to time, we will fall and we will fail.
But, like the great movements of civil rights and anti-discrimination ahead, we will succeed, as we are more powerful together.
Among the musicians taking part in the event this year, in New York, are Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e. It will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Gulf to launch an "instrument" to block Russia's energy exports - Secretary of the Interior
Washington can use the Fleet "if necessary" to stop Russian energy from being sold in the markets, including the Middle East, according to U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as mentioned in the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia is in Syria, as it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government, not an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to settle on energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the weakest part of Europe. That's what he has said according to his report.
And, according to the official, there are always ways to deal with it.
"The United States, with the Navy, has the means to make sure that the sea lanes are kept open, and if necessary, intervene, to make sure that their energy is not available in the market," he said.
Zinke was speaking to the people present at the event, which was hosted by the Consumer Energy Agreement. It is a non-profit group that calls itself the "voice of the energy consumer" in the United States.
He went on to make a comparison between Washington's approach, when it deals with Russia and Iran, indicating that it is similar.
The economic choice of Iran and Russia is, little by little, to have an impact on fuels and to change them," he said. He referred to Russia as a "pony of any kind" that relied heavily on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration embarks on a mission to increase the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump's government officials, including President Donald Trump, are trying to entice Germany to pull out of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that is "disruptive" and, according to Trump, has made Moscow's "bet" of Berlin.
Moscow has often said that Nord Stream 2 pipeline is the only economic project costing $11. It will increase the capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters.
The Kremlin claims that Washington strongly opposes it, for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we agree with the view that fuel can not be used as a tool to pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after his meeting with the Secretary of Energy in the United States.
Germany's response to the U.S. position has been re-affirmed by Germany that it will continue with the project.
Germany's main industry organisation, the German Industrial Federation (CTG), has asked the United States to stay out of the European Union's energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when the third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Federation (CTG), said after recent meetings between the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel and Russian President, Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will watch "Careful" as she heads into the 2020 presidential race, the Massachusetts Senator says.
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts said on Saturday she would look "carefully" at running for president after the mid-term elections.
During a meeting in the town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider going into the competition.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to get the government broken right and take into account there's a woman in charge," she told The Hill.
"After November 6th, I will look carefully at going into the competition for the presidency."
Warren attacked President Donald Trump during the meeting in the town hall, saying he was "building this country in the wrong direction."
"I'm very concerned about the effect of Donald Trump on our democracy," she said.
Warren Trump and the man he nominated to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, have been taxed openly.
In a statement on Friday, Warren said "we're sure there's an investigation by the FBI before we vote."
A public opinion poll released on Thursday showed a majority of voters in Warren's voting district think she shouldn't be in the competition in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not stand, according to a poll by the Suffolk University/Boston Globe's Political Research Center.
Thirty-three of them gave her first support to stand in the election.
The public opinion showed that the former governor, Deval Patrick, had more support. 38 percent supported him to stand and 48 percent opposed him.
Among the Democrats, who were in the public eye to discuss the 2020 presidency position, were former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin cites a Post-traumatic Illness Disorder (NSI), which is on Track Palin, beating up Donald Trump.
Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he was listed in September.
The police arrested him on Monday night and charged him with a family affair.
"My own son has been suffering since he came back and I can understand the difficulties that other families are having with regard to the post-traumatic stress disorder. I understand the injury to returning soldiers and the illness that is putting them off," she told the audience at Donald's funeral.
Palin gave "what no one wants to talk about" about her capture and said about her son and other former soldiers of war, "they return and they become different, they become hard, they return and they doubt whether the public appreciates what they have done and their allies.
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with assaulting a family member, interfering with reports of family violence and possessing guns while he was drunk, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states support the challenge of the new asylum policy.
18 states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge against the new U.S. policy, which refuses to grant asylum to victims, who are fleeing violence related to violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district complained in a court-martial on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker, who was giving away the policy's slogans, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff's full name in the case, Grace v. Sessions, was not mentioned by the U.S. Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal policy.
She said her party "and her violent sons who are members of a Drong," abused her but U.S. officials refused to accept her application for asylum on July 20.
He was detained in Texas.
The state's attorney, who was supporting Grace, said that El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, many of which are seeking asylum in the United States, were nations that had widespread problems with violence and domestic violence.
The new U.S. immigration policy responded to a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants, who were fleeing family violence, to seek asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy makes "a twenty or thirty-year insignificance of state law, federal law, and international law."
"According to federal law, every asylum claim must be assessed on the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and the current ban imposes that principle," the court's friend said in a statement.
Prosecutors further argued that the policy, which banned immigrants, harmed the U.S. economy; they argued that there was a greater opportunity for them to become entrepreneurs and "provide the necessary workforce."
The Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, ordered his foreign judges not to grant asylum to victims, who were fleeing from family abuse and violence, in June.
"There is a sanctuary available to those who leave their home countries, because of perceived or fear of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political views," Sessions said in a statement he made under the policy on the 11th.
It was never meant to solve every problem - even every serious problem - that people around the world face from day to day.
Despite the tremendous efforts made in Palu, the number of deaths doubled in the race to find people who have come to their rescue.
The situation was getting worse for the people who had been rescued.
"We felt the tension," said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she consoled her feverish little boy at an exile centre in the city of Palu, which had been burned to the ground.
"Every minute a patient enters a car body.
There's clean water."
Residents were seen returning to their homes, which had been destroyed, while posing through personal belongings that had been washed away; they were trying to save anything, which was available.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals, which had been destroyed by the 7.5 earthquake, were unable to deal with it.
Let some of the injured, Dwi Haris included, whose trunk and shoulder were broken, who rested outside of Palu Army Hospital as a cure was being given to patients, because powerful aftershocks were still continuing.
The deer had him as he spoke of the terrible earthquake, which shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
They were crushed into the walls, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, explaining that his children were in the big house for marriage.
"I heard my wife beckoning for help, but then everything was quiet.
I don't know what happened to you and your son.
I hope they are safe and sound."
The U.S. ambassador bullies China with ‘bulleting announcements.
A week after China's official newspaper posted a four-page notice in a daily newspaper in the United States, the U.S. ambassador to China told Beijing that China was using U.S. newspapers to expand its coverage.
Last Wednesday, President Donald Trump made a reference to the supplement in the Des Moines Register - the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa - that paid for the China Daily - after it was taken to China that it attempted to interfere in the congressional elections on November 6.
Trump's accusation showed that Beijing wanted to interfere in the U.S. elections a new stage in a campaign, which Washington is increasing to pressure China, U.S. officials told Reuters.
While it's common for lending governments to use ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are mired in a trade war, which is currently on the rise and, as a result, have both put tariffs on their imports.
China retaliated early in the trade war to strike a blow against a state like Iowa, which backed the Trump Republican Party, according to Chinese and American experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a former Iowa governor who exports a lot of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China is "using that coverage by placing bullish ads in America's free newspapers" which Branstad wrote in an article that showed his views in the Sunday newspaper the Des Moines Register.
"The Chinese government is using the American tradition that we have free speech and freedom of the press to spread its propaganda, when it advertises, that it pays for in the Des Moines Register.
"In contrast to that, you won't hear many dissenting voices at the news stand down the street here in Beijing. You won't see the different views that the Chinese people might have about China's economic policy, which is abysmal, if the media is concerned," he said.
He continued: "One of China's major newspapers avoided an offer to publish its article," although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans at Women's Voting from the Door Before the Midterm Elections With Kavanaugh's Case, according to Analysts.
As many major Republicans stand by as they defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, despite some allegations of sexual assault being made, analysts have warned that there will be a backlash, especially from women in the run-up to the election.
People are very confused about this and the majority of Republicans have already said, that they want to go ahead with a vote.
"These things can't be canceled," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University with 'The Hill' for an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted whether Senator Jeff Flake (Republican-Arizona), who tried at the last minute to get an FBI investigation to satisfy angry voters, would be enough.
Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow and they won't forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokesperson for the MoveOn advocacy group, said on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. news.
On Friday morning, this cry "November is coming!" was heard by opponents as they performed in the Seanad hall. The Republicans, who had control of the Committee of Judges, decided to move forward with the nomination of Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Christy.
There will be an overarching increase in the enthusiasm of the Democrats and it will give them a lot of encouragement for life," Stu Rothenberg, an unbiased political analyst, told the news site.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it could be higher, especially among women who are between two councils, in the suburbs and in the younger voters, people between 18 and 29 who don't like the President but don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony, which showed his allegations of sexual assault against the names of the Supreme Court, analysts claimed that there could be a response, if Republicans would follow suit to confirm the names.
"This is a price that is the foundation of the GOP," said Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee at the beginning of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee or the final vote or whether or not Kavanagh is appointed to the bench, it's also about the way in which Republicans deal with this and the way in which they beat her," said Guy Cecil, director of Dapriorities.
However, it seems that there is a divide between Americans, whether or not they will believe after the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh and believe slightly more of them Kavanaugh.
A new poll shows that 41 percent of respondents fully or completely believe Ford's evidence and 35 percent of respondents said they fully or completely believe Kavanaugh's evidence.
In addition, 38 percent of them said they believed, totally or absolutely must, that Kavanaugh told lies in his testimony while 30 percent said the same thing about Ford.
Following the pressure put on Flake, the FBI is investigating the allegations that Ford made, as well as at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, reported the Guardian.
Ford testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh assaulted her under the influence of alcohol, when she was seventeen years old.
Ramirez claimed that the names of her family members were revealed to the Supreme Court, when they were present at a party at the time when two were studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The person who designed the World Wide Web has plans to launch a new website to challenge Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the head of the World Wide Web, is to launch a new initiative, which will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from the famous technologist, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the open source platform Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose the place where they store their data, and the people who are allowed to access that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that Inrupt's stated wish was a "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the initiative.
"It's a historic moment."
The app uses Solid technology to enable people to create their "personal, online data warehouse" or create POD.
There may be contact details, lists of things to do, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It's about as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available on one browser and all available at the same time.
The special thing about the online personal data warehouse is that it is about the user alone to give access to a person, who has a special type of information.
The body refers to it as "personal data processing."
The idea that exists for Inrupt, according to Chief Executive John Bruce, is to provide appropriate resources, process and skills so that Solid is available to everyone.
Currently in the company are Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, several developers on the team, who have a contract to work on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
At the beginning of this week, technology developers around the world could create their decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team were not talking to "Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a full change in which the business models they have converted would base overnight.
"We're not looking for permission."
In a post on Medium, published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission was to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem, to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web, built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee made a change from the Internet base, when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, a voice, which has influenced the debate about the neutrality of the internet, has been in Berners-Lee.
Even when Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will remain as Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Partnership, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm extremely hopeful about the next era of the internet," Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: The Victoria Cross is celebrated in the First World War.
A ceremony has been held in his hometown of a clergyman in the Church of England, the only clergyman to have won the Victoria Cross during World War 1 as a martyr.
The Lieutenant-Colonel, Honorary Bernard Vann, won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But a nascar killed him four days later and he never knew that he had the highest rank in the British army.
A two-stone memorial wreath unveiled at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his friends, Michael Vann, said it was a "wonderful coincidence" that the 100-year-old stone would be unveiled right after his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette on 28 September 1918, the Vann Lieutenant-Colonel guided his battle across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through heavy fog and under heavy attack from park guns and machine guns."
He then pushed up to the line of shooters and with "excellent agility" he guided the line forward before threading on park guns alone and laying three of the debris.
The German narrator of the Vann Lieutenant Colonel died on October 4, 1918 - a month before the end of the World War.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "something I could never do but go to my heart."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, set up a florist following the parade, which was founded by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "felt it was a great honor to take part in the parade" and also said that he was brave enough to have shown a true hero by the support that many people will give.
IMMA's followers stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206 but, instead, found Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you have stayed in your seat all night to watch Bellator 206, which is full of bars but you do not manage to watch the main event.
There were 13 fights on the list of fights from San Jose, he played on the main list and was appearing in a live broadcast throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory Mac Donald were preparing to face each other, the cover changed to Peppa Pig.
Some people weren't too uplifted after they sat down until the early morning to see the fight.
One follower "confirmed" the change to children's cartoons on Twitter.
"Government regulation is that the program wasn't appropriate and, therefore, they had to change to children's programs," said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president, who was in charge of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the pig, that's it."
Bellator President Scott Coker said they will be working on the schedule to provide coverage for UK viewers in the future.
"I think, when I think about the replay, we can work it out," Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we won't be able to work this out until now on Sunday and then on Monday.
But we want to fix it.
Believe me, when the program changed back then, there were a lot of texts going salt and salt and not all of them were friendly.
We wanted to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, it was a government issue.
I can promise you it won't happen next time.
We set five rounds rather than six - as we do, usually - and we tried to provide too much for the trailers and went too long.
This is a terrible situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt ‘scary’ because of his sexuality.
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley says he felt he wasn't as good as others when he was growing up because of his sexuality - but that gave him an incentive to move forward.
The 24-year-old says he didn't understand until he went to high school "everyone wasn't like me."
Speaking on the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, which was presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay people's rights to give "hope" to others.
He also said that if he was a parent now it was not so important for him to achieve victory in the Olympic Games.
The regular presenter of the show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
While on Laverne's first show as a man on a deserted island, Daley said he saw himself as a "lesser" person than everyone else, when he was growing up as "not being socially accepted to enjoy boys and girls with a person."
He said: "To this day, those feelings are that I looked at myself as a person who was less and felt differently, those are the certain things that have given me the power and strength to be able to achieve things."
He wanted to prove that he was ‘something’ worthy, he said, so that he would not disappoint everyone when they finally find out about his sexuality.
The person who won two bronze medals in the Olympic Games is now a campaigner, who is in the public's mouth, for LADT(Leispic, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender). He benefited from being present at the Commonwealth Games on behalf of the British Commonwealth in Australia.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without any significance and wanted to give "hope" to others.
Daley, who was a three-time world champion, said he "got kicked out" when he fell in love with American film-maker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than last year but said there was never a problem with the gap between the ages.
"When you suffer so much at such a young age" - he went to the Olympic Games, initially a bar, when he was 14 years old and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was difficult to find one of his peers who was so far down the top.
The couple have been parents since June. They have a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said that "the whole outlook on life" had changed.
"If you asked me last year what was important, it was all about 'winning a gold standard,'" he said.
"You know, things are more important than Olympic gold coins.
Robbie is my Olympic gold base."
His son Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40, has the same name as his father, when it was discovered that he had brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked if they had their ticket to the London Olympics in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the starting series.
“I couldn’t tell him ‘you won’t be around to be in the starting series, Dad,’” he said.
"I had a handshake with him when he stopped breathing and I didn't admit he wasn't intact until he stopped breathing and he was dead," he said.
The following year, Daley took part in the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
"I knew that that was the dream I had during my life - diving in front of a city crowd at the Olympic Games, there couldn't have been a better feeling," he said.
He inspired his first song choice, as well - Proud with Heather Small - which he applied in the preparations for the Olympic Games and still knocks out the gate.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 every Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Mickelson, who is not functioning properly on the bench of the representatives in the Ryder Corner was placed on Saturday.
The American, Phil Mickelson, will reach the milestone on Sunday when he plays in a game in the Ryder Horn for the 47th time, but will improve their playing, if he knows it will not be a bad occasion for him.
Jim Furyk, the captain, Mickelson, sent to the bench of the representatives for four ball games and four games on Saturday. Mickelson was playing in the biennial competition for the 12th time, a milestone.
Despite being in the middle of the field, as he often did for the United States, Mickelson's division, which had five major championships won, spent his time as a recommended fielder and practicing his playing on the field while hoping he could solve such a problem that he was struggling.
He was never able to hit the ball directly, even when he was at the top of his range, the 48-year-old player is not all right for a narrow course at Le Golf National, as the long haul puts off, on a regular basis, to balls that go on the street.
And if the course itself isn't difficult enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth game, will compete with British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has Tommy Fleetwood, in his first year of play, as his partner and who has won all four games.
If the Americans have a good start, which is four points to the end at the beginning of the 12 singles game, Mickelson's game could be extremely important.
Furyk showed that he had confidence in him, but he couldn't say much else.
"He totally understood the part he had here today, he complimented me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"He's very confident of himself.
He's a very accomplished man in the past, and he's put that amount to these teams in the past, and for this week.
I don't think I've played two games.
I've done more, but that's the way it worked out and we thought that was the direction we were going to move.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's surgery for the man who played the largest number of games on the Sunday.
It could end up being an area that has never been as well as its personal endeavors.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven splits, although Furyk said there were some intangibles for the team because of his presence.
"It's funny, it's bitter, it's despicable, it's good to be spitting on people and it's a great person in the team room," he explained.
"I think the young players had a sport to be proud of, too, this week, which was fun to see.
It's more than just the offer."
Thomas Bjorn realizes that a great farce can go without delay.
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, knows from his own experience that a good farce at the beginning of the last day of the single games in the Ryder Cup can create a difficult day.
The Danish first played in a 1997 game at Valderrama, as a team under his captain, Seve Ballesteros played five points ahead of the Americans but narrowly beat the smallest gap between them, 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a great farce at Valderrama; we had a great farce at Brookline, where we lost and at Valderrama, when we won, but hardly," said Bjorn, who in the picture after him to watch Rank 2018 with a 5-3 win over Ano.
So, history will tell me and everyone that this isn't around.
The first one in the morning.
Get out there and do the right thing.
This is not about the points on the board.
We have a goal and that's to win this corner, and stay focused there.
I've already said, I focus on the 12 players that are on our team, but we know very well who is on the other side - the best players in the world."
Bjorn was delighted about the way his players played and said: "I didn't read too much into it.
Another day is tomorrow.
Tomorrow is about the way in which each individual player will create and there is something different to do there.
It's great to be out there with a party, when things are going well, but when you're out there alone, then try your full resource as a healer.
That's the message you have to apply to the players, that is to play on top of your abilities tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind you and those who play at the top of their ability, too."
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk will overwhelm his players to be able to play better as individual players than how they played with their partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four points.
Furyk has experienced both results of a major change on the last day as he was a member of the team that won at Brookline and then lost as a member of the team, when Europe achieved the "Miracle at Medinah."
"I remember every word of it," he said in response when asked about Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999 and how he crossed his players at the start of the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow but you want to start well about what you saw at Brookline and Medinah.
When that energy goes on on one side, it puts a lot of pressure on the games in the middle of the members.
We decided our team was like that and we put the players out about how we were, you know, to create some magic tomorrow."
Thomas is keen to show leadership in the coming era and is pitted against Rory McIlroy in the main game and Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans in the first half of the day.
"I joined this group of men as I think they'll be fine for the whole day," Bjorn said of his options for the singles games.
The German warship is being re-launched.
A commission should have been made in 2014 on the newest brigade of the German Navy to replace the warships from the era of the Founding War. But it will not happen until next year, due to faulty systems and the cost of increasing beyond scope, according to reports.
The commissioning of the "Rhineland-Pfalz," the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg frigate has been delayed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cited military spokespersons.
The ship should have been part of the Fleet in 2014, but there were major post-delivery problems that greatly contributed to the ambitious project.
Four Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg ships, ordered by the Navy in 2007, will replace the aging Bremen frigate.
It has been suggested that they will contain a powerful cannon, a mix of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as navigation technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are longer maintenance periods - it may be possible to install the newest refrigerators for two years away from home ports.
But, because there was a continuing delay, it means that the leading warships - which would give an opportunity to demonstrate power overseas - will be out of date by the time they are ready, Die Zeit says.
The frigate was unexpectedly in the news last year, when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the ship had been sent back to the builder after being accepted.
Not much was known about the reasons for the ship's return, but the German media cited some "defects on software and hardware" if it were not excited about an enemy mission.
Deficiencies in the software were particularly important because Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-type vessels will be operated by a team of 120 mariners - half of the team that was on older reefs of the Bremen type.
Also, it came to light that the ship is far too heavy, that this reduces the operation of the ship and that it limits the Navy's ability to upgrade in the future.
It is believed that the "Rhineland-Pfalz", which weighs 7,000 tons, is two times heavier than the same type of ships used by Germany in World War II.
Despite the omission of faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the cost of training the team, has become a waste.
The cost is said to have increased to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6) - an increase from the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion it had at the start.
Problems with the newest brigade are very important because of the recent reports that the power of the German army is decreasing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the fleet was "running out of ships that can be evacuated."
The official said the issue had increased over the years because of the decommissioning of old ships but no new ships were made available in their place.
He complained that none of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg's frigates could be part of the Fleet.
The National Trust is reviving the secret life of the leather wing.
New research is underway on an estate in the Scottish Highlands and aims to find out about the way in which the country's leather wing is used to hunt for food.
The new results are expected to shed light on the mother's unique flight behavior and will help guide conservation activities in the future.
A study of the scientists at the National Trust of Scotland will follow common leather wings and soprano pipistrelles, as well as Daubenton leather wings at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recordings will be made at special locations around the estate to follow the activities of the leather wing during the season.
The National Health Service (NHS) team will conduct mobile surveys using hand-held sensors.
An audio analysis of each record, made by experts, will find out the frequency of calls made by leather wings and what each particular species does.
An ordinary map will be made and then a report will be made to show a record of their behavior in a large picture of the landscape.
Rob Dewar, nature conservation advisor to the Scottish National Trust, hopes that the results will reveal the most important natural areas for the leather wings and the way in which each of the species uses them.
This information will help to demonstrate the benefits of normal management such as mollusc creation and how best to preserve woodland for leatherwings and other species related to them.
The number of fur birds in Scotland and across the United Kingdom has decreased significantly over the past century.
They are at risk from buildings and from development work that detracts from their existing barns and from the normals that are lost.
Wind turbines and lightning can be dangerous as there are piles of paper and some chemical treatments on building materials, as well as attacks by cat pets.
There are no blind spots, really.
Because of their hunting habits at night, however, their ears are more useful than their eyes, when they are born on rock material.
They find insects and insects in their flight cones from macaques, a sophisticated technique.
The National Trust of Scotland, which is responsible for caring for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, is very serious about the leather wings.
He has a dozen trained experts, who conduct surveys, regularly, inspect fences and, sometimes, they make a rescue.
The organisation has set up a separate sanctuary for leather wings, the first and only one in Scotland, at the estate of Threeave in Dumfries and Galloway. It is home to eight of the ten leather wing species found in Scotland.
The estate's manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the best district for them.
"We have a wonderful area for leather wings here at Treave," he said.
"We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and a good habit.
But there's a lot about leather wings that we don't yet know, so the work we're doing here and other estates will help us understand what they're up to in the way that they'll be successful."
It emphasizes the importance of checking for leather wings, before maintenance is carried out on buildings and dwellings, as if destroyed with only motherhood, it could be up to 400 female leather wings, young leather wings and, perhaps, the wings of those wings.
Leather wings are protected and it is against the law to kill them, to interfere with them, to destroy their bodies or their limbs.
Elisabeth Ferrell, an Albanian officer for the Leather Wings Conservation Trust, is urging the public to help.
She said: "We still have a lot to learn about our leather wings and, in the case of many of the species we have, we don't know how it is going to be with the entire communities of them.
Ronaldo denies the fraud that has been attributed to him as lawyers are about to put the law in a German newspaper.
Cristiano Ronaldo has been accused of baptising violence as "falseness," saying that people need to "publicize themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are about to take a legal case against a German newspaper, Der Spiegel, which publishes the allegations.
It has been claimed by the Portuguese and Juventus that he raped an American woman, named Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is said to have then given her $375,000 to keep her quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
Talking to him on an Instagram live video with his followers a few hours after the allegations were reported, Ronaldo, 33, attacked the reports and gave them "fake news."
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is a lie," said the man who won the Ballon d'Or five times as he spoke into the camera.
“They want to promote themselves by using my name.
It is natural.
They want to be famous, when they mention my name, but it's part of the job.
I'm a happy person and everything is fine," said the player and smiled at him.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to take a legal case against Der Spiegel over the allegations. They have given him "an unacceptable report of suspicion in the field of privacy," according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "damages, at a level commensurate with the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the worst violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a night club meeting, Ronaldo and Mayorga are reported to have gone back to the player's room as he played her tone-checked, according to papers filed by the County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and that he said he was "99 per cent" well but that the "one per cent" let him down.
The documents claim that Ronaldo admitted that both of them had sex but that it was a consensual sex.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that photos of her victims were taken at a hospital but that she agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "scared to be avenged" and had faith in her "to be humiliated in front of the court."
The 34-year-old woman says she's trying to cancel the arrangement because she's always very upset about the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to go with Real Madrid from Manchester United, when the alleged incident took place, and this summer, he moved to a huge club, Juve, in an arrangement worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Breathability: The UK would be ‘alive forever’ if it were to lose car manufacturers.
The United Kingdom would be ‘reckless forever’ if it lost its status as a global leader in post-Brexit car manufacturing, according to Greg Clark, Business Secretary.
He said it was "a cause for concern" that Toyota RA told the BBC if Britain left the EEC without a solution, it would stop production of cars at its factory at Burnaston, near Derby.
"We have a solution," said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said jobs could be lost, if the border were delayed, in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Burnaston factory - which makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis - last year required 150,000 cars and 90% of them were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"In my opinion, if Britain leaves the European Union without a solution at the end of March, we will stop producing cars at this factory," said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other carmakers have said they are concerned about leaving the EU without a solution to how cross-border trade will work; including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after the Brexit.
The main concerns of car manufacturers are the risks associated with the supply chains in the event that the Breathing occurs without a solution.
Toyota's production line operates on a "direct-in-time" basis. Parts come from suppliers in the UK and EU every 37 minutes for a custom-made car.
If the UK leaves unresolved on 29 March, the border could be jammed, and delays and shortages of parts could result, the industry says.
It would not be possible for Toyota to keep more than a day's cargo at the Derbyshire factory, the company said, and so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's Chequers plan "has been accurately derailed like this at the border avoidance."
"We need to have a solution. We want to have the best solution, not only that will allow the success we currently have to continue, but that we will get this opportunity," he told the BBC.
"The evidence we have from Toyota and from other manufacturers is that we need to be able to continue with the supply chains, which are very promising at the moment."
Toyota was not able to say how long production would stop in full, but in the long run, it said that additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factories and eventually jobs would be lost.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is a organizer for Unite's trade union in the factory. He said his member's concerns were increasing further. "In my experience when these jobs go away, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "A plan, which is accurate and reliable, has been made available for the future relationship with the EU."
There may be a delay in the meeting between Trump and the White House, the White House says.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump's important meeting with the deputy attorney general could be "relaxed for another week" as the fight under the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is exploring Russia's interference in the election, relations between Trump's aides, and the president's possible obstruction of justice.
Whether or not Trump will break the impasse and thereby jeopardize Mueller's independence is the backlash to be heard in Washington in recent months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed using wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility that the president could be removed from office by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein's description.
But he went to the White House last Monday and the story outside that he was about to get out of his job.
In contrast, it was announced that there would be a meeting on Thursday with Trump held by the United Nations in New York at the time.
Trump said he "preferred" not to break Rosenstein out of his job but then the meeting was postponed so that he would not get dirty at the hearing of the Senate committee on the judges in which Kavanaugh and one of the women in respect of whom committed sexual misconduct, Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's plenary hearing.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, she said: "There is no set date for it yet, it could be held this week but I could imagine that it would be postponed for another week at the top of all the things that are taking place in the supreme court.
We'll see, and I'm always happy to keep the press informed."
There are some reporters who would not agree with that statement: Sanders did not have an information session for the press as of September 10.
The host of the show, Chris Wallace, asked her why the story was so.
Sanders said the briefings were not without reason because he didn't like TV reporters to be "chasing," although she said: "I wouldn't deny that they're doing tricks."
She then realized that there would be more direct contacts between Trump and the press.
"The president has more questions and answers than any president has had before," she said, but did not mention any evidence of that. "We looked at those figures."
There will be intelligence gatherings, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States it will be a thousand times better than talking to me.
We try to do that often and you've seen us do it often in the last few weeks and that will be put in a press briefing when you're able to speak to the President of the United States."
Trump often answers questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in open sessions or press conferences along with large visitors to say the least.
There is rarely a single press release.
The president may have shown the reason in New York this week when he met with a bunch of reporters in a way that was sometimes bizarre without restriction.
The Secretary of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland about their concerns about Brexit
The Secretary of Health wrote to EU workers at NHS Scotland to express the country's gratitude and to ask them to stay after Brexit.
MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter and less than six months left until the UK's departure from the EU.
The Albanian Government is already committed to paying for the cost of applications for residency status by EU citizens working in public-sector services.
Mr Freeman wrote in his letter: Negotiations were underway between the UK and the EU on the UK's passage, and a decision is expected in the autumn.
But the UK government is pushing their preparations for a move without any arrangement that could happen.
I know this is going to be a big deal for all of you.
That's why I want to express my appreciation for the work of each team member regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues from the EU and beyond have valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and that go to the benefit of the patients and the communities we serve.
There is no doubt that Scotland is your place of residence and we very much hope that you will stay here."
Christion Abercrombie was killed when he was shot in the head.
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie was reported to have had an emergency operation when his head was injured when the Vanderbilt Commodores beat them 31-27.
Tennessee State's head coach, Rod Reed, told reporters the injury occurred to him shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and fell off a pole," Reed said.
Abercrombie's oxygen trainers and doctors provided it on the online side before they put it on a stretcher and gave it up for further examination.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been taken from the laboratory at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris also said "no information is yet available about the type/size of the injury" and that Tennessee State is trying to figure out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a redwood soprano and this is his first season playing with Tennessee State after he moved from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before he left the game leaving him with a total of 18 tackles during the season.
Higher stamp duty will be charged to foreign buyers when they buy property in the UK
Higher stamp duty will be levied on foreign buyers when they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help homeless people according to the plans of the Towers
The plan will benefit from the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters to it.
The stamp duty will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Exchequer estimates that <0xC2><0xA3>120 million will be raised annually to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that a higher rate of stamp duty will be levied on foreign buyers when they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help homeless people.
The plan will be seen as an attempt to end the success of Corbyn's efforts to attract young voters by providing more affordable housing and focusing on high-income people.
The stamp duty will be levied on people and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK and the extra money will be used to speed up government efforts to deal with people living outside.
The surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the higher rates introduced two years ago on second homes and rented apartments - could be as high as three per cent.
The Exchequer estimates that it could raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that people who do not live in the UK buy 13 per cent of newly built properties in London which raises prices and makes it harder for people to buy their first residence.
Many of the country's culinary districts - especially in the capital - are shelled due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new plan came a few weeks after Boris Johnson was asked to have a stamp duty to help more young people have their first place of residence.
He pointed out to major construction companies that they were keeping housing prices high by buying and not using land and urged Mrs May to end quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain's "life-sustaining" "as far as housing is concerned."
Mr. Corbyn has announced a set of recommendations regarding housing including the control of rents and the elimination of people with no faults being eliminated.
He wants to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "I said last year that the goal I would have while I was in my prime is to reimagine the British vision - that every new generation should have a better life.
And that includes correcting our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who wish to live, work and live here.
It shouldn't be as easy for people who don't live in the UK, and for companies based overseas to buy homes as it is for hard-working British residents.
Dreaming a lot of them where a lot, a lot of people are dreaming of having their own places of residence and the way a lot of people go to sleep outside is a mess."
Jack Ross: "The last glory I have is to be the manager of Scotland."
Sunderland leader Jack Ross has said that his last glory is to be manager of Scotland at some point.
Jack is a 42-year-old Scottish who is currently reviving from the East Midlands club. They are in third place in the Premier League, three points from the top.
He took it to the State of the Light during the summer after he directed St Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
When I was in my game I wanted to play for my country.
I was given a B cap and that's it," Ross told Sportsbound BBC Scotland.
"But when I was growing up I had myself and my dad watching Scotland playing at Hampden and it's always my attraction back.
I won't be able to do that if I'm not a club manager."
Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio were former managers of the Sunderland team.
Ross had previously headed Alloa Athletic and said he had no concerns about coming into a squad of such big people to be told by a big club and that he refused offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My current goal in terms of success is to be the club that put me back in the Premier League.
Because of the structure and capabilities of this club there is no doubt but that it should be in the Premier League," he said.
It's not an easy task but I won't say I'm successful if I don't get it back then."
Ross has only spent three years as a manager and has spent 15 months on Harts' coaching staff as an assistant to Dumbarton.
He helped Alloa come a long way from the way they were put in the third series and made such a turn on St Mirren who was at risk of disqualification that they won the Championship the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than if he did while playing with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"At the time of the events, it was probably," he said, referring to taking command of Alloa.
"I really believed that a job as a job manager was right for me rather than a job as a player.
Maybe that's a weird look when I say it but it turned out pretty well for me, I had a reasonable entry and I enjoyed some pretty high peak points.
But the life of the player can sometimes be difficult.
There are many, many things you have to do a week after a week.
I have to deal with the stress and pressure of work, but I feel that the life of the manager is my life.
I always wanted to be my manager and since I have that job now my mind is more relaxed than it has been since I came of age men."

5:30 p.m. on Saturday is the perfect time for a survey
A summer heat wave is bringing in British pub houses that have been struggling but putting more pressure on determined waitresses.
The figures showed that there was a 2.7 per cent increase in the arrival of pub houses but that there was a 4.8 per cent decrease in the arrival of fixed houses.
Peter Martin of CGA business consultancy who compiled the figures said: "The result of England's participation in the World Cup in July was a longer-lived than expected continuation of the July pattern when the income of more than 2.8 per cent of households was affected.
There was a 1.8 per cent decrease in the trading of securities in June and the story was even worse in July.
It was much better with pub houses and bars that were focusing on drinking matters and there were more of a replica surprise than a replica of it.
The heat of the sun sent out from your tavern houses that were focusing on food matters but it did not have as dramatic an impact on them as it did on those who were determined.
It seemed that people just wanted to go out and drink.
There was a 6.6 per cent increase over the month in the sales of farm houses and bars that were being managed and a three per cent decrease in food sales."
Paul Newman from RSM's hospitality and leisure analysts said: "These results showed the trends we've seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major sporting and social events are the main factors in terms of sales in the out-of-town market.
It is no surprise that determined groups are always struggling, and it will be very difficult for them to accept a fall of 4.8 percent a year after a year with the increasing cost of their ongoing struggles.
The long hot summer could not come at a worse time for those who want to sell food and we will see if the lower temperature we had in August will give relief to those who have very few. The weather is good."
Overall growth of 2.7 per cent in July came from pub houses and endowments, including new-open spaces, reflecting the delay in the supply of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker monitors sales in the residential, residential and residential sector and analyses data from 47 working groups with a turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 million and acts as a benchmark for the Coffer Peach Tracker.
One in five children has a secret social media account and is hidden from their parents.
A survey showed that one in five children - some 11-year-olds - have a secret social media account and keep it hidden from their parents and teachers.
The survey of 20,000 high school students showed that there was a growth in "insta" fake pages.
This has led to an increase in the number of people who are concerned about sexual harassment.
Twenty-one percent of students reported that they have a "principal account" that they show to their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating a social account that they keep hidden from their parents.
The survey of 20,000 high school students showed that "insta" fake pages had grown - a reference to an Instagram photo exchange site.
This has led to an increase in the number of people who are concerned about sexual harassment.
Twenty-one percent of students said they have a clean ‘principal account’ to show to their parents and also have a private account.
A mother of a victim came to a secret site of a 13-year-old girl who had a teenager tattooing on others "I needed it".
The research conducted by bDigital Awareness UK and the Conference of Principals of Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 percent of students between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and that you admitted to those who had private accounts.
HMC leader Mike Buchanann said: "The concern is how so many teenagers are being lured to create online spaces in places that parents or teachers can't reach."
Doyle will act as the "voice of the athletes" on the Scottish Athletics Board
Doyle was elected as the non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Board at the annual meeting of the governing board.
Doyle is Scotland's highest award-winning athlete in the field and park, and chairman Ian Beattie said the appointment was a great opportunity for the people who are leading the sport to benefit from the expansive experience she has gained at the grassroots level.
"The athletes of Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world have a long-standing reputation for excellence in athletics and we are confident that it will go a long way towards relaxing athletics in Scotland," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I am very keen to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope I can do my own share to lead the sport in Scotland."
An American was left without walking ability after suffering a temporary flood of blood restriction despite winning a 200-meter race and a 400-meter race at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and having four Olympic gold bases in total. He often speaks on the BBC.
He wrote on Twitter: "I've been dating for a month and a half now.
I wasn't able to walk
The doctors told us that we should wait to see if I would get better and if I would get better, how much better it would be.
It's been a long time coming, but I've learned how to do it all over again, and I'm doing a lot of work today!
Thank you for the encouraging message that you have sent to me!"
There are conflicting opinions online about a notice that puts mothers who are breastfeeding compared to ba.
There is an online controversy at a company that offers bronchodilator pumps by means of a notice in which women are placed giving birth to a child compared to what is being believed.
On the occasion of the launch of the "world's first breast pump" technology company Elvie sent a semi-real ad that was inspired by music to express the freedom that the pump gives to mothers who are breastfeeding.
Four mothers were dancing in a barn full of fairies and chanting lyrics like, "Yes, I do believe myself but you don't see any tails" and "Fearing that you didn't notice these aren't just my breasts."
The chorus continues: "Be pumped out, pumped out, I'm feeding those children. "Be pumped out, pumped out, I'm raising my women."
The announcement was posted on the company's Facebook page and sparked online controversy.
77,000 people looked at it and hundreds of references were made to it. They had different opinions about it. Many of them said that he ignored the "horrible aspects" of the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use it to advertise the product," wrote one person.
"We were like them in that they had to have a calf to suck milk, but where they stole their children from them a few days after birth."

Another wrote: "It's obviously a traumatic thing for the mother and the baby.
Yes, but why wouldn't they be used to advertise breast pumps for mothers who can keep their children?"
Someone else wrote, "This is your message. It was cut off from the world."
Others defended the announcement and only one woman admitted that she considered the song to be very funny for ever.
"I think it's a wonderful plan.
I'd still have a milkshake.
I just felt like I was going to the pump.
It's a little weird, but I took it on my own.
"Someone else is going to buy this product," he said.
This was referenced by someone else: This is a funny ad that is aimed at mothers who are pumping (often in their workplaces or toilets) and feel that they are like "ba".
This is not a statement that commends or condemns the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the women announce that they were dancing and the pumps were discreetly grown into their final measures.
The campaign is based on the understanding that many of the women who are pumping their breasts consider them to be what they used to be.
Elvie's pump is completely silent, there are no wires or tubes attached to it, it sits discreetly inside a flattened waistband in such a way that women are able to move around, keep their children in their hands and even go out while they are pumping.
This was to be said by Ana Balarin, who is a partner and is discussing early development at Mother: Elvie's Pump is so revolutionary that it has earned a bold, exciting launch.
When we showed the love between pregnant women and dairy cattle, we wanted to draw attention to the breast and all the challenges associated with it, and to give an expression to the incredible freedom associated with the new pump and to do so in a way that amused people.
This wasn't the first time Elsie had been in the news.
During London Fashion Week, her mother walked down a brick platform while using the product. She was showing the work of designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Quietly Sent to a People's Camp on the Border of Texas
There has been a large increase in the number of migrant children caught, although there has been little change in the number of people crossing the border. The story is so because it is now more difficult to bring children to strikers because of strict policies and Trump's hard talk.
What has happened in the past is that migrants without immigration papers were sponsored by the migrants but are now afraid that they will put their ability to stay in the country at risk by applying to sponsor a child.
That risk was increased in June when the authorities announced that people who wish to be their guardians and adults would give their families a thumbs up and share that data with the immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, who is a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the conference last week that the agency had taken in the scores of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later revealed that 70 per cent of the people arrested had no criminal record.
"Nearly 80 per cent of the people who are their sponsors, or are members of a host of sponsors, are in this country illegally, and criminal aliens have a large share of accusan.
That's why we're always looking for those people," said Mr. Albence.
Seeking to process the children more quickly, the officers introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of their capture, rather than after 60 days, which was a standard period previously, according to domestic workers.
Many of them will present themselves through a video conference rather than in person, to make a claim on an immigration judge to obtain legal status.
Those persons who are deemed not to be eligible for relief shall be expeditiously expelled from the country.
According to domestic workers and reports that came out of the system in the last few months while children are in detention, they are more likely to become anxious or depressed and to have violent incidents or escape attempts as a result.
Supporters said those concerns are being raised in more facilities such as Tornillo which are so large that it will not be seen that a child is struggling.
They also said that if children are moved to a pub city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or to leave safely with their friends, that could add to the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria orders US, French, and Turkish 'conspiracy forces' to be immediately purged from the country
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called on Syrian refugees to return home despite the fact that this is the eighth year that a war has taken place in that country.
Moualem, who serves as deputy chief of staff, also announced that the foreign forces in Syria are illegal and have apologised for fighting terrorism, and "will be treated accordingly."
"They have to leave immediately without any conditions," he told the assembly.
Moualem announced "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria where 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and where millions of people have been driven from their homes.
He said the Damascus would continue to "devastate the blessed war until we purge" terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign force from all parts of Syria."
The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria providing training and advice mostly to the Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces that are opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in that country who have been destroyed by war.
As for the refugees, Moualem said the conditions were suitable for returnees and he blamed "some countries from the west" that are "spreading unreasonable concerns" that are encouraging refugees to stay outside the country.
"We have asked the international community and humane organisations to make it easier to return," he said.
"They are making a political issue their problem should be treated as one human issue."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in Idlib, the last stronghold of the rebels, provided an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey has ensured that Syrian forces with Russian support will not invade the region of three million people on a large scale.
Moualem, however, stressed how the agreement has "clear time targets" and said he hoped that during the clashes on Thursdays including those of the Nusra Front which are linked to Al-Quaeda and "will be achieved."
The U.N. envoy, Staffan de Mistura, is expected to hold the new committee's first meeting soon on which government representatives and the opposition will draft a constitution for Syria for the time being to get the war over and prepare for elections.
Moualem laid down conditions for the Syrian government to take part in the committee and said the committee's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution," and he instructed people not to put their finger on the story.
That's why Trump has a second term.
According to that understanding, Mr. Trump should win the 2020 election unless, as many liberals expect, a pre-emptive focus or scandal ends his presidency.

Of course, life is not like a TV show and the stories from Washington may have an impact on what will happen in the future in the Roe v. Wade case, and whether immigrant families can come together again, and the world's economic health.
It's just a matter of getting the best people to watch the show.

Money is being raised outside the House of Representatives in the hottest mid-term elections ever.
It's no surprise that a flood of money is pouring into Pennsylvania's 17th district since a new layout was introduced on the congressional districts so that two elected deputies are competing for the same seat.
A new boundary for the Pittsburgh metropolitan area has been designed in such a way that Democratic Representative Conor Lamb - who won his seat in another area in a special election this past spring
against the current Republican congressman Keith Rothfus, who is the current representative of Pennsylvania's 12th district that largely supersedes New Jersey's 17th district.
The maps were drawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the precedents had been unconstitutionally set out in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the 17th district kicked off a round of turmoil between the party's main funders, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name is in the public's eye in Pennsylvania after he won a special election for the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional District in March that many people were watching.
The Republican had the seat for more than a decade and President Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts say that the Democrats are a little bit ahead of the curve.
SAM was contemplating to impose a punishment on the Savior because of support for China but withdrew from it.
Historians noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Béising that Washington did not do much about it.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela Panama in July 2017 and was a guest in Panama until his partners ordered the Trump Organization's managements to leave.
Heather Nauert, the department's spokesperson, said in a valuable statement this month that State Department officials had decided to call back the U.S. diplomatic mission from the Savior, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "continuing decisions made."
But none of them were thought to be punished except for the Savior who received $140 million in aid in 2017 from the U.S., including drug control aid as well as development and economic support.
Including among the penalties being recommended they were cut on financial aid, targeted restrictions on visas that would severely impact this country in Central America which has high rates of unemployment and murders.
As internal meetings went on, officials from North and Central America withdrew from a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity that was to continue from a meeting similar to last year's one held in New York and which they considered to be progressing towards.
But senior administration officials announced ahead of mid-September that they wanted the conference to go ahead with something that put an end to any plan to punish the Savior.
Vice President Mike Pence is to speak at the conference to be held in mid-November and diplomats say that this shows that the administration considers the meeting to be very important.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to the Savior, Panama, and the Dominican Republic with no harsh messages of punishment from Washington.

The study of history
It could be that the next blow to hit is the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on how Mr. Trump might have obstructed justice and there's a lot of evidence in the public record about that.
There are reports around that Mr. Mueller is also focusing on whether Mr. Trump was working side by side with Russia in the attack they made on our elections.
If another party gains the upper hand in the U.S. Congress, Mr. Trump may have to account for what he did in front of the voters and perhaps in front of a jury of his peers.
There is a lot of uncertainty about the story and I don't want to say that it is inevitable that Mr Trump will be blamed on him or anyone like him in Europe.
We all have choices to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an impact on how long the tide will continue.
German army officers were ready to step up to Hitler in 1938 if the West stood against him and supported the Czechoslovaks at Munich.
We failed and we didn't get the chance to avoid the slate for years.
The course of history revolves around such points and there will be a delay or acceleration in the movement for the end of democracy.
The U.S. is already dealing with a lot of these issues.
What do we do if Mr. Trump gives a stick and a path to Deputy Chief of Staff Rod Rosenstein, the man who is in charge of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been in trouble since a report in this newspaper last year that he was keeping the president's record and revealing opinions that it was not suitable for the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times's account is inaccurate.
"What we'll say if we find out is that the F.B.I.'s investigation that was recently requested of Brett Kavanaugh is more than fair - or if he is re-confirmed as a Supreme Court judge despite credible allegations that he committed a sexual assault that he testified to.
And above all else, will we vote in the mid-term elections for the U.S. Congress that will ensure that Mr. Trump has to account for what he has done?
If we fail in these tests, there will be a long and bitter winter in the face of democracy.

Graham Dorrans is expected to play against Rapid Vienna.
Rangers will be their hosts when they play against Rapid Vienna on Thursday. Rangers did very well when they finished in a league match against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month and if they win Rapid Vienna they will have a good chance of qualifying for G.
Graham Dorrans suffered a knee injury and was unable to play his first game this season until the match against Villarreal ended in a 2-2 draw. However, he believes Rangers could use that result to achieve better things.
"That's what we want as a Villarreal team," said 31-year-old Graham.
"We went to the game and we were hoping to get an advantage from it and we got a point.
Maybe we could get the win at the end but, by the way, it was a good result to finish on a co-scorer.
They were probably more men in the first half but we got better in the second half and we were better than them.
It's going to be a big European night.
I hope that we will succeed in getting three points only there will be a hard game as they had a good result in their last game, but with the support of the crowd, I am sure that we can press on and get a positive result.
We certainly had a tough year last year, with the injuries that happened to me and the changes that happened in the club itself but we think everything is fine now.
The team is good and the boys are enjoying it very much; the training is good.
I hope we can move forward now, put this past season behind us and make sure we have a guarantee."
Women who lose sleep at night due to concerns about retirement savings
Despite the fact that the people who took part in the survey had a clear opinion about how they wanted to be cared for, not many of them were talking to their family members about the story.
About half of the people who took part in the Nationwide study said they were talking to their peers about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them but they're not doing anything to talk to them about it," said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
This is the place to start.
Talk to your spouse and your children. You cannot prepare your children to provide care unless you tell them well in advance what you want.
Work with your counselor and your children to discuss where and how you would like to be taken care of as they may have a significant impact on the cost.
Tell your financial advisor to give advice: The advisor may recommend ways for you to pay for those costs.
The following may be considered as options for long-term care - a traditional insurance policy for long-term care, a cash-valued hybrid policy to help you pay for those costs, or to provide self-insurance for your own wealth - so far.
Prove your legal documents: Avoid legal cases before they begin.
Designate a health care provider to act on your behalf so that you will be able to appoint someone you trust or trust to look after your medical care and ensure that professionals fulfill the things you need for fear you won't be able to communicate.
Think about the power of giving a solicitor to someone in relation to your money matters.
You should choose a person you trust or an agent to make money decisions for you and to ensure that your bills are paid if you are left incapacitated.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and that he or she is on his or her way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions on the subject of drugs and allergies?
Break down these details in a written plan so that you are prepared.
"It's not just the money, it's the doctors," he said.
"What are the rules of medicine?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Get ready for that plan."

He didn't die from the injuries he suffered and asked the police to speak to the witnesses.
Landforms and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials said at least 384 people were killed when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday and the death toll is expected to rise.
The communication systems have been destroyed and welfare officials are unable to obtain any information from Donggala's colonialism, which is located north of Palu and closer to the 7.5-strong land structure's epicenter.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Here are some of the main facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, it is located at the end of the bay on the east coast of the Sulawesi islands and was estimated to have 379,800 people in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit it.
Donggala is an area stretching more than 300 km (180 miles) along the coast on the north-northeast of the Sulawesi Islands.
Development and administrative region is less than five and it was estimated that there were 299,200 people in 2017.
The economy of Central Sulawesi is largely dependent on fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province but most of it is made in Morowali on the other side of the coast from Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala earthquakes and tsunamis have often hit in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Agency.
In 1938, tsunamis killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The western tsunami hit Donggala in 1996 and killed nine.
Indonesia is located in the seismic area of the Pacific Ocean's Thin Ice Sheet and is often hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major landforms and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake occurred on the west coast of Aceh province of Indonesia in northern Sumatra on December 26 that triggered tsunamis that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean and killed half of the accused in Aceh.
2005: A series of coastal landforms hit western Sumatra late in March and early in April.
Hundreds of people have died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of I<0xC3><0xA1>va, the most populous island in Indonesia. It triggered tsunamis that hit the south coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai islands off Sumatra and triggered tsunamis that were up to 10 meters high to destroy the village cliffs and kill about 300 people.
2016: Diminishing earthquake hit the Pidie Jaya development in Aceh. It damaged and released the people who remembered the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
No tsunamis were triggered at that time, but more than 100 people were killed when buildings fell to the ground.
2018: Lombok tourist island earthquakes hit and killed more than 500 people. Most of the accusan were in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's son has been charged with murder
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's former governor and vice-presidential candidate, Sarah Palin, was arrested and charged with assault.
According to a report released by Alaska State Troopers on Saturday, Palin, 29 years old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of being guilty of domestic violence, interfering with the sending of reports of domestic violence and resisting capture.
According to the police report, when a woman he knew tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took his phone from her.
According to a report from KTUU, Palin has been deported to the Mat-Su Preliminary Facility while being held on unsecured $500 bonds.
According to the network when he came before a court on Saturday and when asked what he was arguing about, he replied "innocent, certainly affirmative".
Three A-class executions are being attributed to Palin which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a class B misdemeanor, which means he could face a day in prison as well as a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
He was charged in December 2017 with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Post-Military Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with a home attack, interfering with a report of a crime involving a domestic violence, arming himself while he was under the influence of substance in relation to the incident.
He told her that he had put his hand in her mouth.
Sarah Palin's ex-servicemen's groups taxed in 2016 because she suggested that her sons' violent behavior was caused by post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of her service in Iraq.
Hundreds of people have died due to earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia.
At least 384 people have died due to earthquakes that hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
There was a magnitude 7.5 earthquake and it triggered tsunamis that destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and communication systems have been put in place and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck a short time ago from the center of Sulawesi which is on the northeast side of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos are being sent on social media that show the moment the earth began to shake.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beachside festival in Palu city when the tsunami struck them.
The death penalty is being demanded by federal prosecutors.
Federal prosecutors are demanding that the death penalty be imposed on Sayfullo Saipov who is suspected of having carried out the terrorist attack in which eight people were killed. That is a rare penalty that no one in the state has been convicted of.
It is alleged that Saipov used a 30-year-old rented truck from Home Depot to attack a bicycle range along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan and that he previously drove pedestrians and cyclists in October.
To authorize the death sentence, the prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the victim's uncle on any trip and that he caused serious bodily harm, according to the notice under the resolution to seek the death penalty, placed in a file in The Hague.
A death sentence is likely to be attached to those two charges, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, Saipov's high-ranking federal prosecutor charged in 22 indictments that included eight murder charges for the benefit of mismanagement, usually used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime and mismanagement.
Prosecutors said they wanted "a lot of planning and pre-planning" for the attack and said Saipov did it in a "gritty, cruel and brutal way."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevich Saipov was responsible for injury, injury and loss to Diego Enrique Angelini's family and friends, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Tourists from Argentina were among five of the victims.
Ten years have passed since the last time the South District of New York was indicted in the case of a death.
The defendant was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal case in New York was 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were put to death after being convicted of conspiracy to spy on the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were put to death by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who is originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of regret in the days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
He told the investigators that he felt good about what he had done, the police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was motivated to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also demanded that the ISIS flag be displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22-year-old charge.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "clearly disappointed" by the prosecutors' decision.
"We have to seek the death sentence rather than accept a guilty plea for life imprisonment without any possibility that it would allow the trauma of those events to be extended for all concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team called on previous prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Commissioner Thor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD> says NIGEL FARAGE should be in charge of the Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised ‘to launch the people’s arms’ today in protest at the conference of the Tories.
UKIP's former leader said it was necessary for politicians to be pressured by Eurosceptics - and one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested that he should lead the EU's negotiations.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK would now be "missing" if Mr. Farage were to be Secretary of Breath.
But emphasis has been placed on the challenge facing Mrs May as she seeks to bring together her party's split peers and Conservatives on behalf of Stay after taking part in a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
It is difficult for the Chief Minister to keep his Chequers inter-solution plan on the right track and the supporters of Brexit, the supporters of Stay and the EU are being attacked.
Its supporters have confirmed that it will continue to seek to enter the market with Brussels despite the backlash - and that it will force Eurosceptics to make a choice between its own package and a ‘win-win’.
Mr. Bone said at the rally Event Event in Solihull meant he wanted to ‘wear out Chequers’.
He suggested that it was right to make a pier of Mr. Farage and put him in charge of negotiating with Brussels.
“If he were in charge, we would be gone now,” he said.
Wellingborough also said: ‘I will stand for Brexit but we need to wear out Chequers.’
Explaining the allegations that he is against the EU, he said: ‘We have not fought world wars to be respectful.
We want to make our own laws in our own country."
Mr. Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their minds is that they want to stay out and lie out.’
Andrea Jenkins, who was also present at the rally, told reporters: ‘I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public is not happy with Chequers, the opposition is not voting for them, neither our party nor our activists who are walking the streets and getting votes for us are happy with it in the first place.
I'm going to ask you to throw out Chequers and start listening."
In a direct message to Mrs May, she also said: ‘Principals keep their posts when they add their word.’
Mr. Farage said at the rally that politicians needed to be ‘pressured’ if they were to abandon the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“It’s now a matter of mutual trust — the people — and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to abandon the Breathalyzer and we’re here today to tell them ‘we’re not going to let you do that.’”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he also said: ‘I want you to put pressure on our political class, which is about to abandon the Brexit.
"We are going to be the army of the people in this country who gave us the victory in Britain and we will not let our rest be our independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom."
Meanwhile, fans marched through Birmingham before running a two-hour strike in the centre of the city.
There has been a lot of activity in the run-up to the election after the group's launch this weekend.
The staff of the Workers of Lord Adonis were mocking the Conservatives for the security difficulties they had with the party's application and the start of the conference.
“These are the people we say can implement all the IT systems as well as all the technology for Canada and more, for an unbridged border, for an unrestricted free trade in Ireland,” he also said.
‘Such as fools.
"It's not a good thing and it's not good," he said.
Warren is keen to ‘look closely’ at standing in the presidential election
S.A.M. Senator Elizabeth Warren said it is to "look closely at standing in the presidential election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a town hall meeting in Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently criticizes President Donald Trump, is standing for election again in November against Republican State Representative Geoff Diehl, who was co-chair of the Trump campaign in Massachusetts in 2016.
She said that she could be against Trump in 2020.
The Saturday evening event in Holyoke was the 36th meeting she had with voters and the format of the home hall meeting being used since Trump began his term of office.
One of the participants asked her if she intended to stand in the presidential election.
Warren responded that it was "time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes a woman at the top."
Man arrested after Sims was released from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that someone suspected of the death of the basketball player from LSU Wayde Sims was arrested on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced that Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at a conference at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the release on Friday, asking for help to identify a man who was seen in the film piece.
Sims, 20, was released and killed near the Southern University campus early Friday.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died because of it," police chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde wanted to protect his friend and release him at Simpson's.
Simpson was questioned and admitted that he was present at the crime, that he had an arm, and admitted that he had released Wayde Sims.
Simpson was caught without difficulty and detained at the Baton Rouge East Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6-inch junior player who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 openings last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton on his way to the top of the world after the team orders him to win against Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment that Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes team orders would play a major role in the race.
From the start, Bottas had a good start and little did he leave Hamilton on the beach empty after he defended his place in the first two rounds and invited Vettel's team to attack.
Vettel first went into the lockers and left Hamilton he met with the traffic at the back of the pack, which was right to have a big impact on matters.
The Mercedes went to the circuit's one-lane stop after that and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after some wheel-to-wheel activity after the Ferrari driver left the inside free to restrain and the danger that he would stand the foot after the turnaround.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the tongue and was in seventh place by the end of the first round on his 21st birthday.
Then he was ahead for much of the race keeping a grip on his base to focus on quick territory and overtaking Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
In the end he came into the slate on the 44th lap but was unable to increase his speed in the other eight laps and Raikkonen building the fourth place.
It's a tough day as Valtteri has been trying very hard all weekend and he was a gentleman to the extent that he let me over.
The team has done an excellent job and none of them," Hamilton said.
There was then a horrendous
President Donald Trump was teasing Senator Dianne Feinstein on Saturday after she insisted she didn't leak the letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was sexually assaulted.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly discuss Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "disgusting and ugly and lying."
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that's been going on for a few days in the Senate, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and kind and ugly and lying," he said.
"When you look at stories about release and release and when they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember it?
Dianne Feinstein, what are you waiting for?
Remember his answer... when you spilled his paper - "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, it didn't suck.
I didn't sneeze."
Well, hold on a minute.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
A letter was sent to Feinstein giving details of Kavanaugh's allegations by Ford back in July, and she was fired earlier in September - but Feinstein denied the leak came from his own office.
"I didn't hide the allegations of Dr. Ford, I didn't leak his story," Feinstein told the committee, which was reported in The Hill.
"She asked me to keep it locked up and kept it secret as she asked."
But it seemed that the president had not accepted his denial, saying during Saturday night's rally: "I will tell you the truth, there was a terrible body sign.
Maybe she didn't do it but that's the worst body sign I've ever seen."
"Following his defence of the nominee to the Supreme Court, in respect of which three women committed sexual misconduct, the president suggested that the Democrats were taking advantage of the allegations on their own behalf.
"They're set to take the power back, no matter what way they do it.
You see the anxiety, the greed, it doesn't matter who they hurt, who they are putting under their feet to gain power and control," the president said.
Scothsraith: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two backs for the Giants against Dundee
The loss in the Scots series on Friday against the Belfast Giants was offset by the win in the 5-3 fold game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants were leading by two backs early in the game after scoring Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie took the side of the city to a draw before Dwyer put the Giants first again.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard scored for Dundee before his win after two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen.
It was the third clash of the season in the Scot series for Adam Keefe's team, who came from behind to win Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the Thunder, and the Giants won in the previous three games.
Dwyer's first back came in the fourth minute at 3:35 and he helped out from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford helping Beauvillier get the second back for the team four minutes later.
During a very busy opening period, Sullivan took the home side back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt provided the score for Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants were ahead of the first half before he scored his second back of the night at the end of the first period.
The city side sent them on their own and again Bouchard took out a concussion with an all-out back attack at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran came together to help bring Nielsen Dundee to the front for the first time in the last game in the second period and made sure they would win with a fifth half-way back of their team through the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play Milton Keynes at home in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Gets Death to Make Sure Hundreds of People on Plane Can Escape from Earth's Belt
An aviation regulator in Indonesia is said to be a hero after he died, ensuring that a plane with hundreds of people on it safely flew.
More than 800 people have died and many are still missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering tsunamis.
The area is still being hit by strong aftershocks and many people chanted in the smirk in the city of Palu.
But despite his soul mates fleeing, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the ruling tower that was crippling wildly at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He then stayed to make sure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, would be lifted safely.
Then he jumped off a control tower when he thought it was falling apart.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Yohannes Sirait, said the decision could save hundreds of lives, which was reported in Australia's ABC News.
We have prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it the morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken and we are hearing about this," he said.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that thousands of dead and the country's disaster relief agency may be saying there is a border on the way to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is still estimated to be increasing as many bodies were still under the rubble as not many survivors were able to reach," agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Palu is destroyed by a wave that has reached up to six meters and there will be an all-encompassing event on the Sunday.
Weapons and business aircraft are being built into aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute a hospital takes in a body.
There is a lack of clean water.
Small markets have been created all over the place."
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross Society in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Red Cross Society in Indonesia is running to help the survivors but they don't know what they'll find there.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo came to Palu on Sunday and said with the country's anger: "I want all of you to work day and night to do all the work related to the displacement.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by landslides in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air Niugini now says that one man is wanted after a plane crash in the Strait of Hormuz
The airline that was operating flights that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in the Dominican Republic says one man is wanted, having earlier said that the 47 passengers and crew member all left safely from the submerged plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that from the evening on Saturday it was impossible to find a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, a hospital and investigators and was trying to find the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the passengers and other crew members after the plane hit the water and tried to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven were taken to a hospital.
The airline said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and that all of them were stable residents.
It's still unclear what was responsible for the crash and what just fell out.
Both the airline and the S.A.M. Cavalry said the plane landed in the morgue just before the runway.
A number of witnesses said that the plane went over the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane came in very low.
"That's great," said Jayne.
Jaynes said he and others managed to get through water to the escape routes on the submerged plane.
He said there was a leak under the aircraft attendants and that they were riding and that he suffered a minor injury to the head.
Cafflach S.A.M said nearby miners helped improve the rescue by using inflatable boats to bring people to the beach before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people have died in encounters with PNG-registered airlines in the past twenty years but none of them were Air Niugini.
An analyst outlines the timeline of the night that a woman seems to be alive.
His case was made by the prosecutors on Saturday in the trials of men accused of burning women from Mississippi in 2014.
The Analyst from the Department of Law and Justice S.A.M. Paul Rowlett gave evidence for the long hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He gave the jury an account of how he used phone records to piece together the movements of 29-year-old defender Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night she died.
Rowlett said he got location data from many mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, which went against what he had previously claimed, reported in The Clarion Ledger.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went up to the stand on Saturday and testified that he was not at home that day.
When the defendants asked if Tellis was telling the truth and he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "telling a lie, because my car was in Nashville."
Another discrepancy is that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about a year before she died.
The two had only known each other for about a week, but they didn't know each other for a week.
Rowlett said Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls and contact details from his phone sometime after Chambers died.
"It's ruined her life," Hale said.
It is set out that the defendants will give their closed arguments on the Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to the jury later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip-hop?
A hip-hop trio is trying to challenge the negative attitude towards the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed from Bristol, that hip hap has moved away from its origins as were political messages and addressing social issues.
They want to go back to their roots and have a conscious hip-hop hobby again.
Musicians such as The Fugees and Common have emerged again in the UK through the medium of musicians such as Akala and Lowkey.
There's someone else?!
Child care in New York City puts the law on couples after they are given a stick and a path because of a "ethnic" text message.
A child in New York has been charged with breaking the law for her job indiscriminately after she received a misspelled text message from the mother in which she complained that she was "another blue person."
The couple denies that they are ethnic, and they put the case in the law compared to scrapping."
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a disappointed mother of two, announced when she found out that the new baby-sitter, Giselle Maurice, was blue when she arrived for her first day of work in 2016.
"O MY GOD, ANOTHER GORM," wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending her to her husband, however, she sent her to Ms. Maurice about twice.
After realizing that she had made a mistake, Plasco-Flaxman brought her uncomfortable, stick and road to Ms. Maurice, saying that her caregivers had misbehaved children who were leaving and were African-American and she was expecting a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for the day's work she did and then sent home for Uber.
Now Maurice is putting the law on the couple for breaking her out of her job, and she is seeking compensation equal to $350 a day for the resident, six-month-old who employed her with her face, though she was not given a contract.
"I'm trying to show them, look, you shouldn't do things like that," she told the Post on Friday, also saying "I know there is discrimination."
The couple have responded to the declaration that they are racist, saying it was a reasonable thing to end Maurice's employment, and they fear they might not be able to trust them after they intervened.
"My wife saw something she didn't intend to say.
You don't hate it.
We are not ethnic people," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But would you leave your children in the care of someone you were rude to, even if you made it through a mistake?
Your new-born child?
Now listen to me!"
Plasco compared the case to "scratching" and said his wife was expecting a baby in two months and that she was "in trouble."
"You're going to go after someone like that?"
It's not a good thing to do that," the investment banker said.
While the legal case is still going on, the couple's public has not been lenient on social media, and they are down due to their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that Paddington's publishers were afraid readers wouldn't understand a spoken word bear
Karen Jankel's daughter, Bond's daughter who was born soon after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to imagine that someone you were reading for the first time before it was published."
It's funny now and we know that Paddington has risen to the top."
While saying that her father, who worked as a cameraman with the BBC before being encouraged by small claims to write a book for children, would be positive even though his work was rejected, she also said that there was "soundness and regret" involved celebrating the 60th anniversary of the publication of the death.
About Paddington, whom she describes as "a very important family member," she said her father was proud of her success in the end without being oblivious to it.
"There was a quiet person, and he was cheering for himself," she said.
"But since Paddington was like a real person to him, it was almost like having a kid who does well: you're proud of an essay even though you didn't make the mistake.
I think that's how he looked at Paddington's success.
Although he was the one who created and imagined it, he always gave the recognition to Paddington himself."
My daughter was dying and I was safe to say in the voice
After landing, her daughter was quickly taken to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital, where doctors worked for free to save her life.
"Nad used to call me regularly to say that it was very bad, that she wasn't expected to come safely," said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got the call from Nad to say that she was going to die within two minutes and that I was safe to tell her.
And I told her to be safe.
I said, "Tashi, I'm glad for you, my heart.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors gave her to keep her heart pumping were leaving quickly and leaving her system.
She died a while ago and now everything was closing down.
I was just sitting there, and I knew this was coming out.
I couldn't cry or cry because I had a lot of friends and family around me.
I had to keep control of myself."
In the end, Mrs Ednan-Laperouse, and her daughter's dying, went on the plane alongside the other passengers - and they did not know the heartbeat she had.
"We didn't know," she said.
"My head was bent and the tears were pouring all the time.
It's hard to explain but when I was on the flight I felt sorry for Nad's scope.
It was my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her."
Women who have been given a card to kill themselves in order to prevent suicide.
There are two women who have lost people close to them because of suicide trying to keep others from hand-to-hand killing themselves.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys are putting up cards on a bridge in Little Britain and sending them exciting messages as well as numbers that people can call for support.
Ms Davis's son, Tyler, was 13 when he became depressed and put his hand in his own death when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day," she said.
Ms Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef and that his motivation was to involve others.
Everyone knew about him because of his attitude.
"They're always trying to set up a fire."
However, he got out of his job before he died because he was "in a real place."
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, came to his brother after he laid a hand on his own death.
Ms Davis said: "I'm always worried that it will have an impact on him."
Ms Davis created the cards, "so that people know there are people they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent - if you need to talk."
Ms. Humphreys, who has been friends with Ms. Davies for many years, lost her 15-year-old husband, Mark, soon after his mother's death.
He didn't say it was low-meaning or that he had depression or anything," she said.
"A few days before that, we noticed that he had a change of heart.
He was at the actual Christmas Eve - when the kids opened their presents he didn't look at them or anything."
She said that the trauma was great for him to die, but that they have to face him: "He tears apart the children.
It separates us from each other.
But we all have to keep going and keep going."

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in jeopardy and the FBI has begun an investigation
"I thought, if we were really able to get something like what he had - a limited investigation in terms of time, in terms of scope - that we might have a consensus," Mr. Flake said on Saturday, also saying that he was "scared of having a fear" that he was "scared of it."
Why wasn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters asking for the FBI to investigate?
It's because of time constraints.
There are only 5 weeks left until the mid-term elections, on November 6 - if the Republicans, as he expects, succeed badly, they will be much weaker as they seek to get the man they are elected to the highest court in the country.
George W. Bush is on the phone calling Senators and asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who was working in the White House for Mr. Bush and whom he then introduced to his wife Ashley, as his personal secretary for Mr. Bush.
What will happen after the report is made by the FBI?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are currently sitting.
Kavanaugh will still be able to get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the bond and declare it to the Supreme Court.
There is a decrease in the number of people who back North Korea under Kim.
The number of people who backed North Korea to leave for South Korea has gone at least since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean ministry, said 1,127 people backed North Korea last year, compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that key factors were tighter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates being cut by smugglers.
Pyongyang has not spoken in public.
South Korea's citizenship is ultimately produced for most of the people who give a back to North Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them pass through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and which is easier to cross than the heavily-protected Non-Armed Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers illegal migrants rather than fugitives to be the ones who back North Korea and often sends them back to their own country through pressure.
There has been a significant improvement in the relationship between North and South Korea - which is still technically at war with each other - over the past few months.
Earlier this month, leaders of the two countries held a meeting in Pyongyang for talks in which they focused on the chapters on nuclear disarmament that were not progressing.
That came after a historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed in a general way to work toward the Korean Peninsula as a nuclear-weapon-free place.
But on Saturday, North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho laid the blame on U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and on these circumstances, there is no way that we will disarm ourselves on our own continent first," he said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "potent" and not fit to serve in the Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the nomination to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh was "substantial" and that he was inappropriate from a mediocre point of view to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi gave the remarks in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I have to think if a woman did that, they would say 'obvious,'" Pelosi said of his response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford and the two of them in their teens.
During his open remarks, Kavanaugh was very approachable, almost biking and talking about him sometimes going off while talking about his children and his time in high school.
He clearly blamed the Democrats on the committee, calling it "a blatant and coordinated smear" on the allegations against him and was organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's evidence proved he could not serve in the Supreme Court, as it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disapproves of himself with those statements and the way he went in the pursuit of the Clintons and the Democrats," she said.
When asked if he would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he is confirmed, and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives, she did not agree.
"I'm going to say this -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, it's not just appropriate to be in the Supreme Court but to be in the court where he is now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi also said that she was concerned as a Democrat about possible controls by Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered to be a conservative judge.
In his declaration hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would quash certain decisions by the Supreme Court.
“It’s not the right time for a tyrannical person, inclined to go to court and expect us to say ‘that’s not great,’” Pelosi said.
Women don't have much to say about it.
There is a corrective rule, releasing the months and years of anger, and she can't let it go without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's strange, do you?"
She continued, "A woman who was an executive helped me out somewhere very much, and she said that she was crying too when she got angry, but she developed a meaningful technique when she got angry and when she started to cry, that's when she started to cry, that's when she started to cry.
I'm angry."
And then she followed her.
And I thought that was wonderful."
Deception is allowed as a way to release anger as they are basically not understood.
One of the saddest memories I've had since early work, in an office dominated by men, where I once found that I was crying with anger that I couldn't express, was that an older woman grabbed the back of my chest - a stubborn manager who I was afraid to mess up - always lied to me.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," she told me.
"You don't know you're mad.
They'll feel sorry for you and they'll be happy because they put you in."
Patricia Schroeder, who was a Democratic deputy from Colorado at the time, worked with Gary Hart as he ran for president.
In 1987, when it was revealed that Mr. Hart was engaged in an out-of-wedlock relationship on a boat called Monkey Business and when he left the race, Ms. Schroeder, and with great enthusiasm, decided that she should think about running for the presidency herself.
"It wasn't a stupid decision," she told me, laughing 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last one they had was another candidate.
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because he was the last in the campaign, she was on the verge of raising money so she promised she wouldn't run in the race unless she raised $2 million.
It was a free job.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to men would only give $250 to them.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked herself.
When she made her speech to announce that she would not launch a formal campaign, she was so upset - with thanks to the people who supported her, frustration with the system because it was so difficult to raise money and focus on voters other than delegates, and angered by the fact that she was angry.
"You thought I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder recalled of the response given by the media.
"Kleenex was a corporate sponsor for me.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my grave?
"Did she?"
Why the trade war between the U.S. and China could be a good thing for Béising
You would develop open arms of the war trade between the US and China, and while the war is not at all, Beijing could benefit in the long run from contention between the countries, according to the experts.
U.S. President Donald Trump gave the first warning earlier this year when he cut taxes on China's core exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The sharpest tightening this week occurred with new tariffs having an effect on goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), meaning that tax has been imposed on half of all goods entering the US from China.
Beising deals out retaliation in the same way every time, and the last act was to impose tariffs of five to ten per cent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to respond to a U.S. strike, and it is unlikely to enter the world's second-largest economy on any given day.
If Washington were to stand back, it would mean that it would be necessary to surrender to their demands, but it would be too much of a shame for Xi Jinping, the president of China, to publicly surrender to the US.
Still, the experts say if Beijing can properly play its cards, the pressure from the trade war with the US could positively support China in the long term by lowering the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact is that a political decision in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that would trigger a failure of the economy in either country is actually much more dangerous than what observers have previously admitted," said Abigail Grace, an associate of the New York-based Center for Security.
Syria ‘ready’ for the return of refugees, says Minister for Foreign Affairs
Syria says it is ready for a voluntary return of refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country after it was destroyed in a war that has been going on for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, there are far more stable and healthy issues on the ground thanks to the progress made in combating terrorism," he said.
The government is still renovating the areas that are being destroyed by terrorists to get things back to the way they normally are.
All the conditions are now right for a voluntary return of refugees to the country from which they had to leave due to the terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that focused on their daily lives and lifestyles.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people who still live in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome aid to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he made it clear that she would not accept aid or conditional aid from countries that had managed to pull out of the uprising.
Europe belongs to the Corn Ryder in Paris.
The European Team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup against the US Team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
Now it has been lost by the US six times in a row on European soil and they have not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after the team of Captain Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points they needed to get the best of the United States.
SAM star Phil Mickelson, who was wrestling for most of the competition, threw himself into the water at the 16th hole par a 3, and conceded the game to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian galley made the move in each round, and one of four players who never went 5-0-0 since the current format of the competition began in 1979.
The rookie American Jordan Spieth was placed at 5&4 by the player in the lowest place on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player in the highest place in the world, Dustin Johnson 2 and 1 fell to Ian Poulter from England who may have played in his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, the former founder of eight Corn Ryders, was the biggest European to win the competition and had 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry but I don't have strength today.
It was a difficult year.
I'm very grateful to Thomas for choosing me and trusting him to be with me.
I'm happy with the world, I'm happy to get the corn back.
The team is the most important thing and I'm glad I was able to help them," Garcia said after the European win.
John Ram will come from the same country, who won 2&1 on the famous challenger from SAM Tiger Woods in singles games on Sunday, instead.
"I'm very proud to have won against Tiger Woods, I've been looking at that man as I've grown over the years," said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost the four games he played in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
It's an odd statistic for one of the best players ever, and he's won 14 grand prix, and just before Jack Nicklaus.
It was difficult for the SAM team to find the whites throughout the weekend except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played excellent golf throughout the competition.
SAM captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team had played in his disappointing title, "I'm proud of these men, they fought.
Sometime in the morning, we thought we were going to Europe.
We fought.
It's recommended to Thomas.
It's a great captain.
The 12 players played very well.
We're going to work with the American PGA and our Ryder Corner Committee, and we're going to move on.
I'm proud to be a member of this team and I'm proud to be a member of this team.
You have to be congratulating.
The rest of the team is better than us."
