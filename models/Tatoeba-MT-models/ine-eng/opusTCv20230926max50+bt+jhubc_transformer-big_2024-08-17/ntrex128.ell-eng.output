Welsh MPs worry that they will confuse them with "mapet"
Some MPs expressed concern about the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament – Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This concern has arisen in relation to the plans to change the name of the Welsh Parliament's assembly.
MPs across the political spectrum are concerned that such a thing will sound ridiculous.
A member of the Labour Party said his party was concerned that it would "go along with the words Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside of Wales: In Welsh, the word "twp" means "stupid" and the word "pwp" means "adjectives".
A Plaid MP said the party as a whole was "not satisfied" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his own party was "open-minded" about changing the name, but noted that the word MWP is not far from the word "mapet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to Yorkshire's English pronunciation of the letter u.
The Parliamentary Committee, which is currently drafting the bill for the adoption of the name change, said: "The final decision on any name by which MPs will be called will, of course, be a matter for the MPs themselves."
The Welsh Government’s 2017 Act gave the Welsh Parliament the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, which were widely accepted for the name of Parliament as the Parliament of Wales.
As far as the title of Members of Parliament is concerned, the Commission favoured the name 'Member of the Welsh Parliament' or WMP, but the choice of MWP is the one that received the most support during the public consultation.
MPs are apparently proposing alternative options, but trying to reach a consensus can be a difficult matter for the Speaker of Parliament, Elin Jones, who is expected to table the bill to change the name within the next few weeks.
The law on reforms will also include other changes in the way the parliament operates, including rules of deduction from the office of a member of parliament and the design of the committee system.
MEPs will decide in the final vote on the issue of their name during the debate on the legislation.
The citizens of Macedonia are coming to the polls for the referendum on the change of the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on changing the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The people’s vote was called for in an effort to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens claims that the name of its northern neighbor obscures territorial aspirations and has repeatedly objected to its calls for membership in the EU and NATO.
Gjorke Ivanov, the president of Macedonia, a campaigner in the referendum on changing the name, said he would not take the vote into account.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the change is simply the price they have to pay for their EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin’s bells have been silenced as churches in Harlem are disappearing
“The older people I spoke to say there used to be a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
Today, there is none of them.”
He said he understands why the bars disappeared.
“The world is socialized in a different way today,” he said.
"Bars are no longer the 'living room' of the neighborhood where people regularly frequent."
As for the churches, he worries that the money from the sale of the assets will not last as long as those in charge “hopefully and sooner or later they will return to where they started.”
The churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment blocks filled with people who would not be willing to help the places of worship that have remained in the neighborhood.
“The overwhelming majority of people who will buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore will hasten the day when all these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that all these people who will move into these apartments will become members.”
Both churches were built by white churches before Harlem became the black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community was built in 1870, St. Martin a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation left in the 1930s.
A church of blacks, located a short distance away, took possession of the building.
The occupation of the St. Martin's building was undertaken by a congregation of blacks under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who went on a boycott of 125th Street stores, a major shopping street in Harlem, which they refused to hire or hire.
A fire in 1939 caused serious damage to the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners undertook the reconstruction and ordered the quarry.
Reverend David Johnson, the son and successor of Father Johnson at St. Martin's Church, proudly called the caravan "the bells of the poor."
The expert who played the caricature in July described it in a somewhat different way: "a cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable instrument of historical importance".
The expert, Tiffany Inn of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first carrion in the world played by a black musician, Dionysius A. Lind, who moved to a larger carrion at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's church didn't replace him.
What has happened in recent months at St. Martin’s is a complex story between architects and contractors, some of whom were hired by the church’s popular leaders, while others by the episcopate.
The commissioners - the governing body of the parish, made up of the popular leaders - sent to the episcopate in July a letter regarding their concerns that the episcopate "would seek to shift the cost" to the body of commissioners, despite the fact that this had no involvement in the inquiry and that the authorities had no involvement in the inquiry.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the episcopate.
13-Year-Old Shark Attacked While Diving for lobsters in California
Karharias attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster-fishing dive in California, the first day of the lobster season, according to authorities.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Bicon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the cries of the child asking for help and approached him rowing with a group to get it out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was just screams of excitement because he caught a stick, but then realized he was shouting "Something bit me!
“Something bit me!”
The whole key had been opened,” Hamel observed as he reached the boy’s location.
"I called on everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the sea!'" said Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to Randy Children's Hospital in San Diego and his condition is critical.
The type of shark responsible for the attack remains unknown.
Marine rescuer Larry Giles said in the press release that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was deemed not to belong to any dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim was seriously injured in the upper part of his body.
Authorities have banned access to the beach from Ponto Bis in Casablanca to Swamys in Encinitas for 48 hours for research and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans put pressure on the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s competes with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by placing cosmetic racks corresponding to those of the department stores, staffed with specialist employees.
As part of the significant rise in the UK cosmetics market to <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which is still growing while sales of clothing and household items are falling, the largest cosmetics shelves will be trialled in 11 stores across the country if more are sold.
The investment in the cosmetics sector comes as supermarkets are looking for a way to replenish the space on shelves that once occupied televisions, microwave ovens and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double the size of its cosmetics offering to 3,000 products, including companies such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees series will also be given more shelf space with the company's logo, similar to those of stores such as Boots.
The supermarket is once again launching its own Boutique makeup line so that most products are vegan - something that younger consumers are increasingly asking for.
In addition, fragrance company The Fragrance Shop will try to make its products available in two Sainsbury’s stores, one that opened in Croydon, South London, last week and the other in Shelley Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the trend to buy small amounts of food daily at local mini-markets means that supermarkets will have to make greater efforts to make the world visit them.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said outlet stores will increasingly resemble department stores as supermarket chains try to compete with Aldi and Lidl's discount stores with more out-of-food services.
Sainsbury's put Argos outlet stores in hundreds of stores, while also introducing some Habitats as they bought both chains two years ago, which supported wholesale sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The previous attempt by the supermarket to renovate the cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership came to an end after a dispute over how to distribute profits from drugstores to chain supermarkets.
The new strategy was designed after Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy business it owned with 281 stores to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, versus <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
She said Lloyds would play its own role in the project, adding an expanded range of luxury care companies, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, said: "We have transformed the look and feel of our shelves in order to improve the environment for our consumers.
We have also invested in specially trained staff who will be available to offer advice.
The range of our companies has been designed to meet every need, while the attractive environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a potential destination for cosmetics that challenges the traditional way of shopping.”
Peter Jones: Furious After Holly Willoughby's Withdrawal from <0xC2><0xA3>11 Million Deal
The protagonist of the series Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is furious after the departure of TV presenter Holly Wiloby from the <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with the lifestyle company he owns, in order to devote himself to her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Wiloby doesn't have time for the clothing and accessories company Truly.
Their business was likened to the Goop company of Gwyneth Paltrow.
The 37-year-old presenter of the show "This Morning" announced on Instagram her decision to leave.
Holly Wiloby raved about the protagonist of the series Dragons Den, Peter Jones, stepping away from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute in order to devote herself to her new huge contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones became furious when the golden girl of television admitted to a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, that due to the new contracts, he was not able to do so.
The company has been likened to Guinevere Paltrow’s Goop company and appears to have doubled Wiloby’s fortune estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Following the announcement by 37-year-old Wiloby on Instagram that he was about to leave Truly, Jones flew out of the UK to one of his holiday homes.
According to one source, "Truly was far from Holly Wiloby's top priorities.
It was her long-term future, her source of income for the next few decades.
Her decision to leave surprised everyone involved in the operation.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the presentation.
There’s a warehouse full of products at the headquarters in Marlow ready to be put up for sale.”
Experts estimate that the departure of the presenter of the show "This Morning", which is among the most commercial celebrities in Britain, could cost the company millions due to the huge investment in products from pillows and candles to clothing and accessories.
And that could mean the end of a long friendship.
Holly Wiloby, a mother of three, and Dan Baldwin’s husband have maintained close friendships with Jones and his wife Tara Cap for ten years.
Wiloby founded Truly with the Cup in 2016 and 52-year-old Jones joined as president in March.
The couples spend their vacations together and Jones retains a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become the star of M&S's campaigns and replace Ad McPartlin in the ITV show "I'm A Celebrity."
A source from Jones's close environment said last night "we would not like to comment on his professional affairs."
We were tough, and then we fell in love.
He joked about the criticism he received from the media for a comment that some would consider inappropriate for a president, as well as his so positive attitude towards the leader of North Korea.
Why did President Trump make so many concessions?
Trump said, mimicking the telepresenter style.
"I didn't concede anything."
He said Kim was interested in a second meeting, after the initial meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step toward the denuclearization of North Korea.
However, negotiations on denuclearisation have been delayed.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Rai Yong-ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea “doesn’t see any” North Korea.
Instead, he said, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions aimed at exerting pressure.
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech.
"We're doing very well with North Korea," he said.
“We’re going to have a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would lose their lives.
Now we’ve built this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - the end of missile tests, the release of hostages and the return of the rest of the U.S. troops to their homes.
While he supported his unusual stance in statements about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to have a ‘presidential’ style, but instead of having 10,000 people sitting outside the room because they couldn’t get in, we’d only have 200 people here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia sweep an entire island, leaving thousands of people dead in their path.
In the aftermath of the Lobok earthquake, for example, it was announced that foreign non-governmental organizations would not be needed.
Despite the fact that more than 10 percent of Lobok’s population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, a necessary condition for the utilization of international aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not seeking international assistance, so it is quite difficult,” Ms. Subung said.
While Save the Children is preparing a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain if the foreign staff will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Natural Disasters Service, said Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if it would allow international organizations to contribute aid.
Given the seismic vibrations that often plague Indonesia, the country remains fiercely unprepared for the fury of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not the case on other coastlines.
The apparent lack of a tsunami warning siren in Palu, even after a warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of so many lives.
At best, moving between the numerous islands of Indonesia is difficult.
Natural disasters are further complicating the administrative burden.
A floating hospital that had been stationed in Lobok for the care of the earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo was at the heart of his election campaign to improve Indonesia’s disorganized infrastructure, and he provided simple money for the construction of roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding plagued Mr. Joko’s administration before re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also receiving pressure from her obsessive fanatical tendencies in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people lost their lives and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim groups fought in the streets, using knives, bows and arrows, as well as other improvised weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturgess of Liverpool equalizes against Chelsea <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
Daniel Sturges saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat against Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturges took a pass from Sardan Sakiri about 27 meters away from Chelsea's goal with his team losing 1-0.
He hit the ball to his left and hit the back beam.
His effort was driven very high from the large area and ended up on the right in the nets.
The ball eventually fell over Kepa Arizambalaga who jumped to repel it and got into the nets.
"I was trying to take this position, to get to the ball and players like Shakiri are always playing as far forward as possible, so I tried to earn as much time as possible," Sturges told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Candee coming, I made a direct switch, I didn’t think about it much and I took the shot.”
Chelsea had the lead with 1-0 in the half after the goal in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Azar.
The blue striker gave Matteo Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> his heel in this game, before giving a shot with a bat near the center of the field and running to the side of Liverpool.
Kova<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> made one two in the center of the field.
Then he gave a deep ball, leading Azar to the big area.
Azar ran in front of the defender and finished by sending the ball into the net on the back beam with a left-handed shot in front of Alison Becker of Liverpool.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at Stazione San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton at UEFA Europa Leaguge at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832.
Indonesia’s post-earthquake and tsunami death toll stands at 832, according to the country’s Natural Disasters Service, early on Sunday.
Many people were trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed after the 7.5-degree earthquake that struck the area on Friday and created waves up to 6 meters high, a spokesman for the service, Sutopo Puruo Nugroho, told a news conference.
The city of Palos, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by the rubble of the buildings that collapsed.
Police Arrest 32-Year-Old Suspect After Murder of Woman with a Knife
A murder investigation has been launched following the discovery of a woman's body in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55 a.m. with stab wounds at Grayson Moose in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested as a suspect in the murder.
The police asked the locals who saw or heard something to report it to the police.
“The investigation is in its early stages, but I would like to appeal to anyone in the neighborhood around John Street who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us,” U.S. District Attorney Brian Oggan said in a statement.
I would also like to appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something in the shots from dashcam cameras to contact us as they may have in their possession information that is vital to our investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found is a resident of Birkenhead and was found inside a building.
This afternoon friends who believe they may know the woman arrived at the scene of the crime to ask questions about the location where she was found this morning.
Investigations are under way as police say they are in the process of informing their closest relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Moose, in an attempt to return to his apartment, was informed by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
The residents were informed that they may need to spend hours before they are allowed to return to their homes.
A police officer reportedly told a man that the entire area is currently being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears at the scene.
He kept saying, "It's horrible."
At 2 p.m. two police vans were inside the police cordon and one outside.
Officers were standing outside the cordon and were watching the apartment building.
Anyone with any information is kindly requested to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 for case 247 of September 30.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament becomes the last monument to be struck by the "rewriting of history"
His exodus would be a poetic justice for the Taliban’s destruction of England’s numerous cultural and religious works by his fanatical Puritan supporters.
However, the Cromwell Association described Mr. Crick's proposal as "foolish" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Association, said: "In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell's form would not be targeted outside the Westminster Palace.
The iconoclasm of England's civil wars was neither dictated nor executed by Cromwell.
Possibly, a wrong member of the Cromwell family was sacrificed for the actions of Thomas' ancestor during the previous century.
Cromwell’s outstanding portrayal of Sir William Hamo Thornikroff is characteristic of his 19th-century image and part of the historiography of a personality that many believe is worthy of honor.
Mr. Golntsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is still regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than he is today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, the monarchy.
Whether this is an absolutely accurate case is the subject of an open historical debate.
All that is certain is that the conflicts in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognizable personality who represents one side of the divide.
His accomplishments as Lord Protector are also commendable and memorable.”
Pig-killer injures Chinese farmer to death
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwestern China, according to local news reports.
The man, known only as "Wan", was found with a severed artery in a blood lake near a pig farm in Liupanshui market in the province of Guizhou, in southern China, the Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farm official is preparing to vaccinate pigs on May 30, 2005 in Xining, in the province of Kinhai, China.
He is believed to have travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered the door of a neighboring pig farm open.
He stated that there was a large male pig with blood in its mouth in the hoof.
The coroner’s examination confirmed that the pig weighing 227 kg had fatally injured the farmer, according to his report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloodied and cremated,” said the cousin, known by the name of “Wu,” according to the Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage shows Wan entering the market at 4.40 a.m. on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man does not belong to Wan, nor to his cousin.
A market official said in a late-night news report that the pig has been put in a cage to not attack anyone else, while police collected the evidence at the scene of the attack.
Wan's family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating some compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have also been recorded in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 295-pound pig threw a farmer in Wales on his tractor until the farmer’s wife scared the animal away.
After the incident in which an Oregon farmer was scuttled by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as an “enema.”
"They're just in a playful mood.
They're small, very strange creatures... they don't want to do harm.
We just have to show them proper respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are going to bring extensive rainfall to the Southwestern U.S.
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder water masses of Mexico’s northern coasts.
However, Hurricane Rosa will bring torrential rains to northern Mexico and the Southwestern United States in the coming days.
The strength of the winds of Hurricane Rosa reached 85 mph, making it a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. Eastern Time on Sunday and was detected 385 miles southwest of Punta Euchenia, Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a region of low wind pressure has begun to form over the Pacific Ocean and move eastwards to the U.S. West Coast. As Hurricane Rosa approaches the Lower California peninsula on Monday, a tropics
Hurricane Rosa will bring rainfall of 25 centimetres to areas of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the approaching low wind pressure region will create extensive heavy rainfall in the Southwest over the next few days.
Locally, rains of 2.5 to 10 centimetres will cause dangerous floods, torrential downpours and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity will lead to rainfall rates approaching 5 to 7.5 cm per hour at local locations, particularly in parts of South Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfalls of 5 to 10 centimetres are expected locally in the Southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Floods are possible with rapid deterioration of the phenomena due to the scattered nature of tropical rainfall.
It is recommended to avoid any movement on foot in the desert in view of the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains can turn canyons into rushing rivers, and storms will cause local strong winds and sandblasting.
The low wind pressure area will create some locally strong rainfall on-site on the Southern California coastline.
A total rainfall of more than 1 centimeter is possible, which can cause small torrential flows and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the area.
Some scattered tropics will begin to approach Arizona late on Sundays and early morning hours on Mondays, before the phenomena expand late on Mondays and Tuesdays.
Heavy rains will spread to the Fore Corners area on Tuesday and will last until Wednesday.
In October, there will be some dramatic temperature changes across the U.S. as temperatures in the Arctic drop, but in the tropics they remain quite high.
Sometimes, this fact leads to very intense temperature changes at close distances.
A typical example of the sharp temperature differences between the central U.S. was observed on Sunday.
There was a nearly 10-point difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and De Moyne, Iowa.
Over the next few days, persistent high summer temperatures will be observed and spread again.
In much of the Central and Eastern U.S., October is expected to start at high temperatures of 27°C from the Eastern Plains to parts of the Southeast.
The temperature in New York can reach 27 °C on Tuesday, about 5 degrees above average.
According to our long-term forecast for the weather, there are several chances of above-average temperatures being observed in the eastern U.S. by the first half of October.
More than 20 million viewers watched Bret Cavanaugh’s audition.
More than 20 million viewers watched the gruesome testimony of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh, Thursday, and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, which is alleged to have occurred in the 1980s, by Christie.
Meanwhile, the political deadlock continued, with television networks disrupting the normal flow of the program for the last-minute reversal on Friday: the agreement by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to conduct a week-long investigation by the FBI into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was 100 percent sure how at a party while she was a high school student, Cavanaugh attacked her while she was drunk and tried to take off her clothes.
Cavano, in a loaded deposition, said he was 100 percent sure that this had not happened.
According to Nielsen’s measurements, it is likely that more than 20.4 million viewers watched the hearing on Friday.
The company calculated the average TV viewing on the networks CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers did not immediately make themselves available to other networks that broadcast the audition, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
While also, Nielsen usually finds it difficult to calculate the number of viewers watching a broadcast from office spaces.
For us to see this TV show in its correct dimensions, it is a common one of similar size to what it is watching a football match of the play-offs or the ceremony of awarding the Oscars.
The Fox News channel, whose journalists strongly supported Cavano’s appointment, was preceded by an average of 5.69 million viewers during the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
In second place is the ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS followed with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million, and CNN with 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The interest remained high even after the hearing.
Flake was the main character in Friday's drama.
After the Republican moderate’s statement that he would vote for Cavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning recorded protesters disapproving him as he tried to get into the elevator for the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood with his eyes low for several minutes as they praised him, live on CNN television.
"I'm standing here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth in the country?
He said, "You have power when so many women are powerless."
Flake said his office had made statements and, before the elevator doors closed, that he would have more to say at the commission hearing.
All cable TV and broadcast networks were covered live a few hours later, the Senate Judiciary Committee’s vote on promoting Cavano’s candidacy in the Senate’s plenary for a vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations against the candidate next week, which was requested by a minority of Democrats.
Flake became convinced in part after discussions with his friend, Democratic Party Senator Chris Cohns.
After discussions with Koons and some other senators then, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s choice was valid because it was obvious that the Republicans would not be able to vote for Cavano’s approval without conducting an investigation.
President Trump has asked the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations against Cavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses her critics of playing games with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of plans to leave the European Union of "playing political games" with Britain's future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, England, on 29 September 2018. (more...)
In another interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, former foreign minister Boris Johnson has been harshly critical of the Chekers Brexit plan, saying the proposal to levy tariffs between Britain and the EU was “completely over.”
Gunman Wade Sims: Police Arrest Suspected Dayton Simson for Murdering Player at LSU
Police arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old member of the LSU basketball team.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed on second-degree murder charges, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
The authorities have in their hands a video of Sims's involvement with Simson and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police located the glasses at the scene of the crime and said they found traces of Simpson's DNA, according to the WAFB, which cooperates with CBS.
Following Simpson's interrogation, police said they had admitted that he had fatally injured Wade.
His bail was set at $350,000, according to his lawyer.
According to the preliminary report of the Eastern Baton Rouge medical examiner released on Friday, the cause of death is a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The Department has placed at the disposal of the Louisiana Police a special task force, the police crime lab, the Southern University Police Force, and the citizens of the area to assist in the investigation into the arrest.
LSU sports director Joey Alleva thanked the local law enforcement authorities for the "serious investigation and the pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98-meter-high forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball team coach Will Wade said the team is "destroyed" and "in a state of shock" since Wade's death.
“We’re always worried about incidents like this,” Wade said.
Volcanic ash emissions in the City of Mexico
Volcanic ash emissions from the Popocatepetl volcano reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned residents of Mexico on Sunday to stay away from the volcano, after activity in the crater reached its peak, with 183 gas and ash emissions recorded in a 24-hour period.
The Center monitored various indications and small seismic vibrations.
Images on social media show windshields of cars covered with thin layers of ash in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Socimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in the activity of the volcano located 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after a clash of pro-independence protesters with the order’s re-establishment units, as thousands took part in the protests for the first anniversary of the vote on Catalonia’s secession that sparked a polemic.
A group of masked pro-independence protesters, held by the order’s restoration units, threw eggs and paint into the dust, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets that are usually flooded by tourists.
Complications were also noted later in the day with police using their clubs to quell the complications.
For hours, Catalan pro-independence groups chanted the slogan "We do not forgive, we do not forget" against groups of protesters in favor of the unity of the country who chanted "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were hospitalized with micro-injuries that occurred during the demonstrations, according to the local press.
Tensions remain high in the region that supports independence a year after the proclamation of the October 1 referendum as illegal by Madrid, which is nevertheless celebrated by Catalan separatists.
The overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, although the turnout was low with those who oppose independence boycotting the referendum.
According to the Catalan authorities, about 1,000 people were injured last year after police authorities tried to stop voting at polling stations in the area where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Friday to avert a demonstration of support for the national police force.
The demonstration took place but was forced to take a different approach.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in pro-independence protests with his wife, said he no longer had hope for Catalonia's prospects of gaining independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents with tears of joy that they managed to vote, but now the situation is stagnant,” he said.
Despite the fact that they scored a vital victory, albeit limited to their regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties struggled to maintain their momentum this year, with many of their best-known leaders being arrested or detained.
Joan Pouts, a 42-year-old engineer who recorded on his mobile the protests in favor of the police, said the clashes were fueled by politicians from both camps.
"The tension is escalating more and more," he said.
On Saturday, Oriole Junkeras, one of nine Catalan leaders jailed last year, announced his candidacy for the European elections next year.
"My candidacy in the European elections is the best way to denounce the suppression of democratic values and the repression that we have received from the Spanish government," he said.
LONDON: Arrest of a man after a car crash at home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a repeated car crash at a London residence.
The incident unfolded at Ballinagarde Crescend on Thursday at about 19:30 BST.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
There may have been a shooting in the car at some point.
Menga's strike gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingstone secured the win
The promoted Livingstone surprised the Rangers by giving Steven Gerard just his second defeat in 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox Group.
Dolly Menga's stroke made the difference as Gary Holt's side changed level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerard's team is out of the league this season without a win and faces the Harts, who have an eight-point lead, next Sunday.
Before this match, the Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingstone, meanwhile, remains undefeated in six games in her category, with head coach Holt not having tasted a single defeat since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingstone misses opportunities in front of visitors
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before he scored, with her immediacy putting the Rangers in a difficult position.
Scott Robinson took a lead and stopped just before the finish, but Alan Lithgow repulsed his effort by slipping Craig Halket's head away from the finish line.
The fielders willingly let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could force the visitors into free kicks and corners.
And this is how the important goal came about.
The Rangers could not prevent a free kick and Livingston made the opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to send the ball to Menga, who took the ball and scored from the center of the area.
Up to that point, the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball but found the defense of the fielders impenetrable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly did not face difficult situations.
This form continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos pushed the ball away from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's ball bounced off the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lithgow's pass came out in another free-kick in Livingston.
There were many vertical passes in the Livingstone area and they were constantly repulsed, while two penalties were requested - after claiming the ball from Halket against substitute Glenn Middleton and one for hand - which were rejected.
"Excellent game" by Livingston - analysis
Alexander Lamont from the BBC Scotland at the Toni Macaroni Arena
Spectacular performances and results for Livingstone.
All in all, they were excellent, surpassing expectations in this ascending course.
Their playing style and personality changed little after their return to top form, but the credit should also be given to Holt for the boost he gave to the team upon his arrival.
His team had so many heroes.
Chief Halket was excellent, deploying a highly organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joey Warell on alert throughout the game.
The Rangers, on the other hand, had no inspiration.
No matter how good they were in the past under the guidance of Gerard, they did not meet these standards.
Their last game was incomplete - only once they managed to pass the defense of the midfielders and this is a warning bell for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the standings.
Emotions echoed at Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an’s reception in Cologne
The climate was good on Saturday (September 29th) at the meeting of the heads of state of Turkey and Germany for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at restoring relations with NATO allies.
They had broken down in relation to issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new huge mosque.
The city is home to the largest community of Turks outside Turkey.
Police shut down the gathering of 25,000 people in front of the mosque for security reasons, but many supporters managed to get close enough to see their president up close.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an - many of whom are of Kurdish origin - also gave the present, condemning both Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The division of the protesters reflects the controversial nature of a visitor treated by some Turko-Germans as a hero and by others as a dictator.
Car Accident in Detford: Death of a Biker after a Car Crash
A cyclist lost his life in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Detford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and the ambulance rescuers tried to help, but the man lost his life on the spot.
The clash came a few months after a similar incident in which a driver hit and abandoned a cyclist, who lost his life on Cilders Street, about a mile (1.6 km) from Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said the authorities are making efforts to identify the man and to inform their closest relatives.
The roads have been closed and the bus routes have been diverted, while drivers have been instructed to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prisons: Six Police Officers Injured in Complexes
Six police officers were injured in riots that broke out in the high-security men's prisons, according to the Prisons Directorate.
Riots broke out at His Majesty Long Lartin Prisons in Worcestershire at approximately 09:30 BST on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Special police forces "Tornado" have been deployed to deal with the riots, in which eight inmates are involved and who have manifested themselves in one wing.
Police officers were hospitalized with micro-injuries to the face during the complexions.
A prison spokesman said: "Specially trained personnel undertook to deal with the incident in the prisons of His Majesty Long Lartin.
Six members of staff were hospitalized with injuries.
“We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and make it clear that those responsible will be turned over to the police authorities and may serve a higher sentence.”
In the prisons of His Majesty Long Lartin are held more than 500 prisoners, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison administrator was hospitalized after being attacked by a detainee.
In October of last year, the re-establishment units were called to the prison to suppress serious incidents that broke out, during which members of staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (areas with drought may be benefiting from it)
It’s rare for a tropical recession to hit Arizona, but that’s exactly what’s likely to happen early next week, as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa will traverse the southwestern parts of the desert, bringing flooding to their pass.
The National Meteorological Service has already issued emergency flood warnings for the Gulf of Mexico on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, including the Gulf of Mexico and the Gulf of Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa is expected to pass just above Phoenix on Tuesday, where it will arrive late on Monday with rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have remained in a tropical storm or low barometric state less than 200 miles from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane less than 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the U.S. National Hurricane Center predict a rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with individual rainfall volumes of up to 6 inches at Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the Southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to experience rainfalls of 1 to 2 inches, with the possibility of individual total rainfalls of up to 4 inches.
For areas that are not at risk of flooding, the rain brought by Rosa can be a blessing, as the area is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious issue, a part of this rainfall is expected to be beneficial, as the Southwestern states are currently experiencing drought conditions.
According to the U.S. Dryland Observatory, more than 40 percent of Arizona faces at least extreme drought, which is the second-highest category of drought, according to weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will make landfall on the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Maintaining the intensity of the hurricane, on Sunday morning Rosa will be located 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico with maximum winds of 85 miles per hour and will move north at a speed of 12 miles per hour.
The storm will encounter colder waters in the Pacific and, therefore, will weaken.
Therefore, it is expected to arrive on land in Mexico with a tropical storm intensity in the afternoon or evening of Monday.
There may be heavy rainfall in areas of Mexico, which will cause a significant flood risk.
“Total rainfall volumes in the range of 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora are expected, which are likely to reach as high as 10 inches,” according to weather.com.
Then, Rosa will head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm now, and will arrive at the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low barometric, which will then pass through Arizona to reach southern Utah.
"The main risk expected from Hurricane Rosa or its remnants is the very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern states of the United States," the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous severe flooding and blizzards in the deserts and landslides in the mountainous terrain.
Attack on Minzomer Norton: Four arrests for attempted manslaughter
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old were arrested as suspects in an attempted homicide after a 16-year-old man was found to have suffered knife wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found injured in the area of Excelsior Monster of Mindsomer Norton, at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where he remains in "steady" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police are appealing to anyone who may have recorded in a video on their mobile phone what happened.
Trump says Cavanaugh "lived the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party.
"The vote in favor of Judge Cavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's indecent and outrageous tactics," Trump said at a rally in West Virginia's Willing.
Trump said Cavanaugh had "lived the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the process of appearing as a candidate.
Cavanaugh testified in Congress on Thursday, categorically and with obvious emotion denying Christine Blaise Ford’s claims that she was sexually assaulted decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also filed a lawsuit in front of an audience over her allegations.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the greatness, quality and courage" of Cavano on that day.
“The vote to confirm Judge Cavanaugh’s candidacy is a vote to confirm one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record of public service,” he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to Cavano’s candidacy, while speaking about the importance of the Republicans’ participation in the midterm elections.
"We have five weeks left of one of the most important elections in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but it's actually like I'm," he said.
"That's why I travel everywhere supporting outstanding candidates."
Trump said the Democrats are on a "resistance and obstruction" mission.
The first major procedural vote in the Senate on Cavano's candidacy is expected to take place later on Friday, a senior aide to the Republican Party leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed by an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia and the total number of victims is expected to increase
At least 384 people were killed, many of whom were dragged by the giant waves that swept the coasts when a major earthquake and tsunami hit Indonesia’s Sulawesi island, authorities said on Sunday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the beach of the city of Palos on Friday, when waves of six meters high hit the land at dusk, dragging many to death and destroying everything in their path.
The tsunami occurred after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat came out yesterday, people were still on the beach and didn’t run immediately, so they were hit by it,” said Sutopo Purwoo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s BNPB disaster management service, in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, wood, houses, it hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled to the ocean at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people climbed the trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster management service show many destroyed buildings and shops, bridges that have been collapsed and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Riots continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
Earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Bureau of Technology Assessment and Implementation (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s huge earthquake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb that fell in Hiroshima during the Second World War.
The city's geography, which lies at the end of a narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extended" and said hundreds of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He reported that bodies of victims were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the casualties and damage were likely to be greater along the 300-kilometer-long coastline north of Palu, in an area called Dongala, which is closer to the quake's center.
The communication systems "totally failed and there is no information" from Dongala, he said.
"More than 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the areas affected.
“This is already a tragedy and it can get even worse,” he said.
Extensive criticism was exercised in the Service on Saturday because it did not inform that a tsunami had hit Palu, although according to officials, the waves had arrived at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the top floor of a building is heard screaming in panic, trying to warn people down the road about the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water slams into the shore, dragging homes and cars.
The Reuters news agency was not able to immediately verify the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage, which also cut off communications in the wider area of Palos, making it difficult to coordinate rescue efforts from authorities.
The army has begun sending transport planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but the displaced still need desperate food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport reopened only to contribute to the relief efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia is more than 800.
The situation is very bad.
Although World Vision staff from Dongala managed to arrive safely in the city of Palu, where workers found shelter in accommodations by mossamadas set up in their office lobby, they went through disaster scenes in their path, Dosemba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he said.
The situation is very bad.
While some relief groups have taken on the sad task of starting the process of relieving the wounded, some complain that foreigners, especially experienced workers in the field of providing assistance, were not allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, the flow of financing, supplies and personnel from abroad can only start if the site of a disaster is declared a zone of national disaster.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for Indonesia's Red Cross.
"When the government says it is a national disaster, we can apply for international assistance, but there is no decision yet."
As the second day in Palou passed after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, the friends and family of those who are still missing still hope that their loved ones will be the miracle that will make the history of these natural disasters less painful.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled over by a hypochondriac.
On Sunday, rescuers released a woman who had been trapped under debris for two days, next to her mother’s dead body.
Ghenton Subandono, head coach of Indonesia’s national slope vaulting team, had trained two of the missing paratroopers for the Asian Games, which were completed earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other people trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandaji, were his students.
“As an elder in the sport of downhill, I have my own emotional load,” he said.
Geddon told how, when news of the collapse of the hotel Roa Roa in the community of paragliders began to send desperate WhatsApp messages to his opponents in Palu who took part in the festival on the beach.
However, the sign next to his messages was a gray "n" symbol, instead of two blue.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves stole $26,750 when they refueled an automatic take-off machine in Newport, Ontario.
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was refueling an ATM machine in Newport, according to a press release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle had evacuated an ATM machine in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, police officer Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "came running after Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not determine the number of those involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identity should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Yee
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Yee.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “The one that is officially known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been listening to the eponymous Yee for a long time and used the pseudonym as a title on his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change preceded his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons," according to the show's creator.
In addition to being a shorthand for the business name he uses today, West had previously stated that the word has religious significance for him.
"I think the word 'ye' is the most commonly used word in the Bible, where it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, in a discussion of the title of his album with radio producer Big Boy.
So I'm you, it's us, it's us.
My name changes from Kanye, which means "the only one," to Yee, which is just a reflection of the good, the bad, the confused self, of everything.
The album is probably a reflection of who we are.”
It is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sinn Cobbs is known by various names, such as P.Daddy, P.Daddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West associate, TZEI-ZI, is also satisfied with the use of his name with or without paula and capital letters.
Mexico’s President-elect vows not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday in Pla<0xC3><0xA7>a Tlatelolco that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, troops fired on a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were taking root all over Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to those studying and by opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities push young people towards criminal gangs.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. will have to double the amount it spends on research in this area, says AI investor and AI professional Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Microsoft and Google.
This comment is being added to announcements by various parts of the U.S. government about artificial intelligence, as the U.S. does not have an official artificial intelligence strategy overall.
Meanwhile, China last year unveiled its plan to become the first country in the world to innovate in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“The doubling of the research budget for artificial intelligence would be a good start, given that all other countries are so far behind the U.S. and we aim to make the next significant discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
The doubling of the budget could double the chances of the next major achievement in the field of artificial intelligence taking place in the U.S., Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book titled "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley + China's New World Order" (The superpowers of artificial intelligence: China, Silicon Valley and the new world order of things) was released this month by Harcourt Publications.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an artificial intelligence system that beat the best American player, Othello, while later he was an executive at Microsoft Research and chairman of Google’s China branch.
Lee recognized the importance of previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Service (DARPA) Robotics Challenge, and wondered when the next one would be held, in order to identify the next visions.
Researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that gets the best in academia, it’s the companies,” he said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have all been taking licenses from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee argued that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. support its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
"I believe that a green card should automatically be offered to holders of a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence," he said.
The State Council of China issued a Plan for the Development of the Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence (AI) in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies, respectively, share money with U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work is poor in China.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which will include partners from the business and academic worlds, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The U.S. National Science Foundation invests more than $100 million a year in research in the field of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, no progress has been made in U.S. law for months with the goal of creating a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonia's citizens hold a referendum to decide whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia took part in a referendum on Sunday to decide whether the country would be renamed the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would fuel a decades-long dispute with Greece that had blocked the country's bid to join the European Union and the South.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of the northern neighboring country represents a claim on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President George Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised doubts about whether the turnout will reach the required 50 percent for the referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was as follows: "You are in favour of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece".
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to seek membership in organisations such as the EU and NATO for FYROM, one of the countries that emerged from the conflict.
“I came here today to vote for the future of the country, so that young people in Macedonia can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, because that way our lives will be safer for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it is not legally binding, several members of parliament have stated that they will comply with the result of the vote to make it final.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election committee said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, turnout reached just 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when it gave the voter turnout to 66 percent of registered voters.
“I came to vote for my children, our position is in Europe,” said 62-year-old Jose Tanevski, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoraf Zaev, his wife Zorika and his son Dusko voted in the referendum on the change of the name of the country that would pave the way for the country's accession to NATO and the European Union in the city of Struga.
In front of the Parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and places chairs in front of scenes set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of NATO and the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high, not as second-class partners,” Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia, and become a member of the Eurasian Union.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership would bring in much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20 percent.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
He said a positive result would be "confirmation of our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Political Research Institute of Macedonia, a percentage of the voter turnout would be between 30 and 43 percent, i.e. lower than the required turnout.
According to another poll conducted by the TV station Telma TV of Macedonia, 57 percent of the respondents were planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote positively.
In order for the referendum to be successful, the turnout must reach 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, this will be the first serious blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since its rise to power last May.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero passes all of Brighton's defence to score a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling formed the defence of Brighton by winning 2-0 for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero showed that he scored easily in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker took a pass in the middle of the field at the beginning of the phase.
He passed three of Brighton's defenses before they spilled out into the open.
Then, Aguero was found surrounded by four green players.
He dribbled past one defender, then escaped from several others at the edge of the great Brighton area.
Then, he gave way to his left, finding Sterling.
English forward made his first move in the area by returning the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan, scoring on the right side of the net.
"Aguero is facing some problems at his feet," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We played 55 to 60 minutes.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky he scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Blues the initial advantage in the battle of the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep into the Brighton area at this stage.
He sent a beautiful ball along the left side to Liroy Sane.
Sane kept the ball in his possession and guided Sterling to the rear beam.
The Blues forward kicked the ball into the net just before he got out.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League groups on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rain-Neckar Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Serzer wants to beat the Rockies.
As the New Zealanders were excluded from the playoffs, there was no reason to try to make another start.
But the always-competitive Serzer hopes to play Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are still any repercussions for the Rockies in the playoffs as they advance against a Los Angeles Dodgers game at the National League West.
The Rockies have gone into the playoffs with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to lock in first place in their category.
"Although we have nothing to gain, at least we can play knowing that the atmosphere here in Denver with the fans and the other team will be a game probably of the highest level that I will face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to fight in a fight like that?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will be the starting pitcher on Sunday, but it is rumored that they tend to let Serzer throw the ball.
Serzer, who will make his 34th start, made practice shots on Thursday and will play on Sunday, which is normally a rest day for him.
The right-hander from Washington has an 18-7 performance with an average winning points (ERA) of 2.53 and 300 outs due to strikes in 220 2/3 periods this season.
Trump is giving a speech in West Virginia.
The President referred indirectly to the situation regarding his chosen candidate for the Supreme Court, Bret Cavano, in his speech on the importance of the participation of Republicans in the midterm elections.
"Everything we have done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important electoral processes in our lives.
I'm not a candidate, but it's actually like I am, and that's why I travel everywhere to support great candidates," he said.
Trump went on to say, “You see this miserable, miserable, radical group of Democrats, you see what’s going on right now.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see the evil, the misery.
They don’t care who they hurt, who they have to destroy in order to take power and control, because what they want is power and control and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have taken on a mission of "resistance and obstruction."
“And you’ve been seeing this for the last four days,” he said, describing the Democrats as “angry and evil, miserable and liars.”
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by making nominative references to Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, a report that was accepted with strong disapproval by the public.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you reveal the document?
Oh, oh, what?
No, oh no, I'm waiting for an answer. That was a really bad use of body language, the worst use of body language I've ever seen."
The Labour Party is no longer a broad party.
He is not tolerant of those who express their opinions.
It did not surprise me at all that activists of the Momentum movement in the local group voted to impeach me.
After all, I am the last of a series of Labour MPs who have been told they are not welcome, precisely because we are saying our opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, had a similar attitude, because he was resolutely opposed to anti-Semitism.
In my case, my motion of censure was criticized because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
For the importance of a responsible economic policy, for national security, for Europe, paradoxically, for issues similar to those that Jeremy had disagreed with previous leaders.
The invitation to the workers’ meeting in Nottingham East on Friday stated that “we want our meetings to be productive with the participation of all”.
For most of the eight years I have been a local Labour MP, the General Committee meetings on Friday evening were just like that.
Unfortunately, today, this is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of a "more compassionate, more compassionate" policy has long been forgotten, if it ever really began to be implemented.
It is becoming increasingly obvious that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that any opinion is judged on the basis of whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became chief, as colleagues with whom I had previously considered that we had similar political views began to expect me to turn 180 degrees and adopt views with which I would never agree, whether those were national or national.
Every time I spoke in public, no matter what I was really saying, I heard a chorus on social media, where some people asked for my rejection, rejected the center’s policy, and told me I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And that didn't just happen to me.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than my other colleagues, as the comments addressed to me were usually political.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but never back down.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era in politics is how insults are now considered normal.
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that the Labour Party should encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a broad party and that with every proposal to defame or change the rules of choice, the party’s boundaries narrow.
I have been advised many times in the last two years not to rise, not to talk too much and that so "everything will be okay".
But I didn't get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party, 32 years ago, as a student still, due to the neglect shown by the Thatcher government which led literally to the failure of my entire class, my aim has been to provide better public services to those who need them most, as well as to those who need them most.
I never hid my politics and I did the same in the last election.
No one in Northumberland East could have been confused in any way with regard to my political views and points of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who put forward the motion of censure on Friday, all I have to say is that while the country is facing a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on whether I am loyal to the leader of the EC.
But, really, my only message is not to the members of the Momentum movement in Nottingham, but to my voters, whether they are Labour Party members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of rejection or political expediency will deter me from doing so.

Air - Melrose: 38 - 17: The invincible Air climbs to the top
Two late goals may have somewhat distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ir deserved to triumph in this extremely entertaining today’s game of the Tenend Championship.
It is now at the top of the rankings, the only undefeated group out of ten.
In the end, it was her superior defense, as well as the best use of opportunities, that tipped the scales in favor of the midfielders and coach Peter Murtsi had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been tested in our games so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: “Congratulations to Air, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's goal in the 14th minute, with Fraser Klimo's conversion, brought Eire to the front, but a yellow card to Scottish Rory Hughes, who was released for the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to score.
Klimo increased Ir's lead with a penalty, before scoring, right in the half, a goal with a conversion, leading Ir to the locker room with a score of 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's goal, with Baggot's conversion, reduced the lead to five points.
There was a long wait due to a serious injury to Ruarid Nott, who was removed by a stretcher, and, after restarting, Ir further increased the difference with a goal by Stafford McDowell, with the conversion of Klimo.
Deputy Chief Blair McPherson then took a yellow card and Melrose again took advantage of Bruce Colvin's goalless numerical advantage, after a period of intense pressure.
The fielders came back, however, and when Struan Hutsinson took a yellow card to the Klimos without the ball, from the penalty line, McPherson scored a goal on the back of the attack launched by Air.
Climate made a conversion, as it did again almost from the restart, after Kylie Rowe first picked up David Armstrong's kick and sent the extreme Gregor Henry away for the fifth goal of the fielders.
The protagonist of Still Game begins a new career in the spotlight
The protagonist of the series Still Game Ford Kiernan seems ready to jump into the catering industry, after it was revealed that he has been appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays the role of Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-stars with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hempfield.
The couple announced that the upcoming fifth round will be the last of the show and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Gageland.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the information, though a Scottish Sun source hinted that Kiernan wanted to deal with the "shopping industry" in Glasgow.
“The Sea Is Ours”: Enclosed Bolivia Hopes Court Will Reopen Road to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the fully equipped naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings, blue flags are waved.
At the base of the navigator from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon is written the motto: "Our sea is rightfully owned.
It is our duty to take her back.”
Throughout the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline that Chile conquered after a bloody conflict over the exploitation of natural resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the longing of its people to travel to Eir.
These hopes have been raised today more than ever, for decades, as Bolivia awaits the decision of the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of consultations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and calm, and of course awaits the outcome with a positive outlook,” said Roberto Calzandilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice’s ruling on big screens across the country, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s demand that Chile, after decades of indiscriminate negotiations, be forced to intervene.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is waging a contentious battle for his re-election next year, has much to gain or lose from Monday’s decision.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that, even if it did, it would not change much.
The UN body in the Netherlands does not have the power to give a thousand territories and has made it clear that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s decision is due to be issued just six months after the final arguments were presented suggests that the case “wasn’t complicated,” said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of furthering Bolivia’s goals, the past four years may have undermined them.
"Today's Bolivian government has stepped up the issue of access to the sea," Zarate said in a statement.
Morales’s aggressive rhetoric has exhausted Chile’s remaining good mood, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to have discussions after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Velje, a Bolivian representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the process of issuing the court’s ruling was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have “an excellent opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and the opportunity to “end 139-year-old disputes with mutual benefits,” he said.
Kalzantila also denied that Morales, who remains one of Latin America’s most popular leaders, is using the issue of sea-going as a political dean.
“Bolivia will never be denied its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
The decision is an opportunity to see that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea Says There Will Be No Nuclear Disarmament If It Cannot Be Trusted by the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his state will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it can’t trust Washington.
Ry spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made during a summit in Singapore by the two heads of state.
Ri made these comments while U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears poised to restart nuclear diplomacy that had reached a dead end, three months after the meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s leader, Kim Jong-un.
Ri says that the view that the continued sanctions and the U.S. refusal to declare an end to the Korean War will at some point force the North to "knee" is a summer night's dream.
Washington is reluctant to agree to the declaration if Pyongyang does not make significant disarmament moves first.
Both Kim and the U.S. President, Donald Trump, want a second summit.
But there is widespread skepticism about whether Pyongyang is seriously considering revoking an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only means to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit of Kim-Trump's leadership.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in oversized hats that will soon be available in a store near you
If you want to increase the collection of hats you have or completely avoid the sun, then stop looking.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown presented at the show a series of bizarre oversized hats for their Spring-Summer 2019 collection that stole the show at Fashion Week in Paris.
Extremely uncomfortable hats flooded Instagram this summer and their designers sent their impressive creations to the catwalk.
The part that stood out from Valentino was an oversized beige hat decorated with a wide borscht with wings that completely covered the heads of the models.
Among other oversized accessories were watermelons decorated with pebbles, a magic hat, even a pineapple, but these are not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also presented a series of strange masks, on time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had embroidered lips and referred more to Hannibal Lecter than to high-sharpening fashion.
One creation brought to mind a complete equipment of diving with a respirator and glasses, while another looked like melted ice cream in a cone.
And if you want to adopt this fashion style with the huge accessories, you are in luck.
Stylists predict that these huge hats could reach the main shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats made their appearance very quickly after "La Boba", the straw hat with the very wide power that we have seen so many wear, from Riana to Emily Rataikovsky.
The popular brand that created the extremely uncomfortable hat that flooded social media sent yet another great creation to the catwalk, a beach bag almost as big as the model who wears it wearing his swimsuit.
The dark orange bag of shelves, decorated with crocheted shelves and a white leather handle, was the piece that stood out from the La Riviera Spring-Summer 2019 collection of Jacquemus in the Fashion Week in Paris.
Brand stylist Luke Armitage told the FEMAIL column: “I’m looking forward to seeing big hats and big beach bags in the stores next summer, as the designer made such a great feeling that it would be hard to ignore the buzz.”
John Edwards: Language skills are essential for the citizens of the world
Scotland’s independent schools have a history of academic excellence, which continued into 2018, with yet another series of outstanding test scores, which were further enhanced by individual and collective successes in sports, the arts, music and other community endeavors.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible level of service to students and their parents.
The objective of the independent schools is to prepare their students for the next and higher educational degrees, the professional careers they will choose and their position as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an on-demand school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and desirable elective course in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, what you say gets into their head.”
If you speak to him in his own language, what you say goes into his heart.”
This is a strong reminder that we cannot just rely on English if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the recent results of this year’s exams, we find that languages are at the top of the performance charts, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages achieved an A-level of baccalaureate.
Data collected by 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 per cent of students achieved an A grade in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of those who studied German, 69 per cent of those who studied French, and 63 per cent of those who also studied French.
This proves that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital skills that will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
Languages today, as a course of choice, are considered as important as the courses relating to science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission revealed that, in terms of the reasons employers struggled to fill vacancies, a rate of 17 per cent was related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, the need to acquire language skills is becoming more and more urgent, so that young people are prepared for their future professional career.
As more future employment opportunities require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalised world. -
Regardless of the career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future, because of this skill that you will be able to use throughout your life.
If someone is able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, then automatically this multilingual person will have an advantage over the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent of respondents were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to make a conversation, while French was the only language that spoke two-digit percentage of respondents (15 percent).
For this reason, investing in language teaching today is important for today's children.
Knowledge of many languages, in particular the languages of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some schools will focus on the more classic modern languages, while others will teach languages that are considered more important for the UK in 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
For whatever your child is interested in, there will always be some languages to choose from in the independent schools, which have specialized teaching staff in this field.
Scotland’s independent schools are committed to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
No one can deny today that, in a global business environment, languages continue to be extremely important for the future of the country, so this reality should be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to provide this choice, multiculturalism and excellence for Scotland’s young people.
They have to do it.

LeBron will make his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait for fans eager to see LeBron make his first appearance with the Los Angeles Lakers has almost come to an end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the first game ahead of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it has not yet been decided how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Truddell tweeted that James was likely to play a few minutes.
After training a few days ago, James was asked about his plans for the six-game schedule that the Lakers have to give before the season.
“I don’t need prep matches at this stage of my career to get ready,” he said.
Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of rallies starting in the West Virginia town of Willing.
It’s the first of five planned Trump rallies next week, which includes tours to friendly areas such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote of his choice for the Supreme Court on hold, Trump is seeking to bolster popular support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress with a vote of no-confidence.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in West Virginia’s Willing is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online below via live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to refer to this week’s hearings for the candidate for the position in the Supreme Court, Bret Cavano, which were conducted in a tense atmosphere due to allegations of sexual misconduct, with a vote on confirmation of the Senate’s ruling.
However, the primary goal of this series of gatherings is to help Republicans facing a two-pronged outcome in the November elections in order to gain some momentum.
Thus, President Trump’s campaign staff said that these five gatherings next week are aimed at “mobilizing volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they have in the Senate and the House of Commons.”
"Congressional control is so critical to his agenda that the president travels to as many states as possible as we go through the busy period of the campaign," Trump's campaign spokesman, who wanted to remain anonymous, told Reuters.
The planned evening rally at Willing's Wesbanco Arena could bring supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract coverage from the Pittsburgh media," according to the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state that won by a difference of more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrissey, a Republican candidate in West Virginia for the Senate, who is low on the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morisseau that the president should come and try to give him a push to the polls," Simon Hender, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team has the strength to fight to keep hope alive as it drives through Sunday’s singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday’s fours this afternoon might have been what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging suspension of the momentum is a completely invented sports idea, but players believe it deeply, and especially in such confrontations.
Where would they say the momentum is now?
“It was going six degrees and now it’s going to be four, so we probably have a little momentum,” Jordan Spieth said as he left for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, to advance by four points and to stay twelve more in the game.
Americans, as Spith says, feel the "air in their sails" and have a lot to encourage them, like the Spith and Justin Thomas twins who played together all day and each scored three points out of four.
Spith was fatal from tee to green and sets the example.
The voices of the celebrations became louder as he continued his round, taking a critical hit to get the game four all-square when he and Thomas were down two after two.
The blow with which they won the game in the 15th was accompanied by similar celebrations that show his belief that the American team is not out.
“You have to look deep inside yourself and worry about your own game,” Spith said.
It's what every player has left behind.
18 holes to write history.
The only players with more points than Spith and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s strange but adorable twin has scored four out of four and seems to be doing nothing wrong.
The "Mollywood" was the only duo that didn't hit the bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
This game, as well as the way in which the energy seems to flow to and from the noisy spectators, seals the fact that it is the players who will have to win on Sunday and that there is no more popular player than Fleetwood or Molinari to seal a possible opening.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
The debate on European glory remains premature. . . .
Baba Watson and Webb Simpson put on the glasses of Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, when he played with Alex Noreen.
With a bogey and two doubles on the front nine they tied the Spanish and the Swedish so deep in a hole they couldn’t get out of it.
On Sunday, however, there will be no one to help you get out of your hole.
Fourballs and foursomes are so exciting matches to watch them closely because of the interactions between couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and how a strategy can change at a moment’s notice.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken a significant lead on the last day, but this foursome match also showed that the U.S. team has the guts, despite some doubts.
Europe takes the 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after its advance to the fourball and foursomes on Saturday with 10-6 against the USA.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari made a comeback with two wins against a struggling Tiger Woods and managed to take the lead at Le Golf National so far at four points.
The European side of Thomas Byron, who is trying to maintain the trophy he lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated the inaccurate American side in the morning fourball, with a 3-1 series.
The U.S. resisted the foursome more, winning two games, but were unable to cover the difference.
Jim Furik's side need eight points from Sunday's 12 singles matches to maintain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win a four-point series, while along with Molinari, also known as "Mollwood", after a shocking weekend, he is only the second duo to win four-points in the Ryder Cup.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they joined forces to defeat a tired Woods and American newcomer Bryson DeSambo with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who was drawn in two games on Saturday, showed occasional bursts of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourball and foursome and seven series.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning fourball, returned to fellow Henry Stenson for the foursome with 2&1 defeats of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Capca, taking first and third place in the world rankings.
Not everything went well for Europe, despite the pleasant, cool day south-west of Paris.
Three-time winner Jordan Speth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a difficult 2&1 win over John Ram and Ian Poulter of Spain in the fourball and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the foursome while losing the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team been able to recover while losing by four points in the singles, although because he is the troupe, Furik is enough to achieve a draw to maintain the trophy.
However, after being in second place for two days, it seems that a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their capabilities.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally without confidence-building measures
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions deepen a sense of mistrust of the United States and that his country is not going to unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general assembly of the world body that North Korea had taken "significant measures of good will" in the past year, e.g. the cessation of nuclear and ballistic tests, the decommissioning of nuclear test facilities and the decommissioning of nuclear weapons.
“However, we do not see any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such conditions, there is no way to unilaterally begin our disarmament.”
While Ri repeated North Korea’s well-known grievances about Washington’s resistance to the possibility of a “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded as it progressed in the process, his statement was not significant to the point that it was a “step-by-step” approach to denuclearization.
Ri referred to Kim Jong-un’s and Donald Trump’s public announcement at the first summit held between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work for the Security Council.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first “hand over” its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease the harsh international sanctions that have been imposed on North Korea.
“The U.S. insists on being ‘first denuclearized’ and increases the pressure by threatening sanctions to achieve their goal by blackmailing, even impeding the ‘declaration of an end to the war,’” he said.
“The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of those who don’t know us.
But the problem is that the ongoing sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ry did not make any reference to a planned second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader pointed out to the United Nations earlier this week.
The minister, however, noted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added: "If the partner on the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the country would have been impoverished.
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from last year when he told the United Nations General Assembly that targeting the U.S. homeland with North Korea’s ballistic missiles was inevitable because “Bad President” Trump fired.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who threatened last year to “totally destroy” North Korea, has heaped blame on Kim for his courage to move ahead with disarmament measures, but said there is still much to be done and that sanctions should remain in place until the end of the Cold War.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no timetable for it, saying "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the imposition of sanctions by the Security Council must continue intensively and incessantly until complete, final and confirmed denuclearization is achieved."
The Security Council has unanimously approved sanctions on North Korea since 2006 in an effort to neutralize the financing of Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip didn’t go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, to be denounced by North Korea a few hours later as having "the demands of a gangster".
North Korea pledged in a meeting with Moon this month to de-escalate a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States were to take “appropriate measures.”
He clarified that Kim told him that the “appropriate measures” he seeks were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and promote the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard Students Are Taking Lessons on How to Get Enough Rest
This year, a new course at Harvard University seeks all undergraduate students to sleep longer in an effort to combat the growing mass culture of all-night study with the consumption of high levels of caffeine.
One academic discovered that students at the world’s number 1 university often don’t know basic things, such as how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"In the end, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why am I learning about this just now, in my last year?'
She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep — something that surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, which began for the first time this year, explains to students the basic principles of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and athletic performance, as well as to improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to include the course when it was found that students lacked a significant amount of sleep in the middle of the week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive assignments.
In one section there is the image of a student dormitory, where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sports shoes and books, to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, how the athletic performance is affected by it, and how athletic performance is affected by it.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of stroke, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their day-to-day routines.
"We know that it will not directly change the behavior of students.
But we believe they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects when you choose to smoke,” added Professor Schisler.
The culture of being proud because you’ve studied all night still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Enough sleep, of good quality, should be the students' "secret weapon" for fighting stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, even to avoid weight gain, as sleep deprivation puts the brain in a state of starvation, resulting in a state of hunger.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old Californian studying Chemistry and Physical Biology, helped Professor Schisler design the course, having attended one of his classes last year, his first year in Harvard.
He said his class opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a class all over the campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar program before they begin their studies at this highly competitive educational institution.
Professor Schisler advised students to set up a notification for the time they should go to sleep, as well as an alarm clock for the time of waking up, and to know the harmful consequences of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can be turned off.
Livingstone - Rangers 1-0: Menga sets a goal for Gerard's men
The Rangers suffered another sad loss away from home, as Dolly Menga's shot led Steven Gerard's disorganized side to a 1–0 defeat at Livingston.
Imbrox's team was looking to score their first away win from the February Labrod triumph with a 4-1 win at St. John's, but Gary Holt's team caused Gerard's just second defeat in 18 games as a coach, leaving the team eight points behind.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime, and the Rangers' invigorating roster seemed unable to make up for it.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingstone climbs to third, with just one goal difference from the previous Hibernian.
Rangers can expect more trouble, as superintendent Callum Spence had to receive first aid for a head injury caused by an object that was thrown off the platform.
Gerard made eight changes to the composition of the team and defeated Eyre in the semi-finals for the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same "Live 11" composition that he got a degree from Harts last week and would be happy with how this crippled machine of his was able to suffocate every effort of opponents.
Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingstone did more with the ball.
He should have scored in the second minute when Menga's first away pass sent Scott Pittman into Alan McGregor's area, but the midfielder didn't find the ball.
A deep free-kick by Kigan Jacobs found Chief Craig Halket, but fellow defender Alan Lithgow could only do so by sending the ball away from the beam.
Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith for the game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have won a penalty in the 15th minute, as he clashed with Steven Lowes, but referee Steven Thompson ignored Colombiano's complaints.
Rangers had only two shots in the area in the first half, but former IBROX goalkeeper Liam Kelly didn't worry at all about Lasana Coulimbali's head and Ovi Ezzaria's subdued shot.
Although in the first 34 minutes of the match Libya was clearly below expectations, no one can deny that it deserved the win for the effort alone.
Again, Rangers failed to deal with Jacobs' problem.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and found Menga who just completed the effort.
Gerard made changes in the half-hour by taking out Coulibaly and putting on Ryan Kent. The change paid off almost immediately, as the extreme passed the ball to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran off his line to block him.
However, Livingstone continued to draw the guests into the style of the game he knows and enjoys, with the Lithgow and Hulket removing one distant ball after another.
Holt's side could have widened the gap towards the end, but McGregor dealt with Jacobs in a straight line, stopping him before Lithgow's attempt by the corner.
Rangers deputy Glenn Middleton had another penalty phase in the end, as he clashed with Jacobs, but again Thompson ignored it.

A page from the almanac Sunday Morning: September 30, 1882: as today, 136 years ago and VALE ... the day that the future physicist Johan Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity; this invention eventually led to the device that is now known as the Geiger counter.
A pillar of science since then, the counter Giger has crossed into the realm of pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, starring the unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive metallic elements, such as uranium.
When you wear these headphones, you hear the action of people caused by radioactivity on the metal elements."
Evans: "Look, he's acting crazy!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
However, the invention that bears his name continues its work.
New Anticancer Vaccine Teaches Immune System to “See” Problematic Cells
New Anti-Cancer Vaccine Teaches Immune System to “See” Problem Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Problem Cells in the Context of Treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their modification in the laboratory
They can “see” a protein that is common in various types of cancer and then be re-infused into them.
One vaccine being tested shows promising results in patients with various types of cancer.
A woman who was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize the problem cells, saw her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from the patient, modifying them in the lab so that they "see" a protein common to many cancers, which is called HER2, and then reinjecting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzovsky, from the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “The results show that we have a very promising vaccine in our hands.”
As Professor Berzovsky explained, the HER2 protein “is the driving force behind the development of several types of cancer,” such as breast, ovarian, lung, and colon cancer.
A similar approach in which immune cells are extracted from patients and then "taught" how to target cancer cells has been used to treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West defended himself against Trump, wearing a MAGA hat, after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go very well
Kanye West was disapproved at the studio during a Saturday Night Live interview in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in the 2020 election.
After presenting his third song for the evening, entitled Ghost Town, in which he wore a baseball hat with the slogan Make America Great Again, he gave a recital of tributes against the Democrats and repeated his support for the band.
“I talk to a white guy a lot and he says, ‘But how do you like Trump?
“If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL opened with a sketch starring Matt Damon, with the Hollywood star disguising Brett Cavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Christine Blaise Ford's allegations of sexual misconduct.
Although it was not broadcast, the video with West's delusion went viral on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock tried to distract West with this post.
West also complained to the audience that he was not treated well in the back because of his hat.
"I was bowled in the back.
They said, "Don't go out in your hat."
I've been bullied!
And they say I don't know what's happening to me," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "I don't know what's happening to me; I'm going to wear the Superman cap, because then no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to go ahead?
“Try love.”
His comments were disapproved at least twice by the public and SNL's coefficients appeared to be in a difficult position, Variety reported, with one person stating in the magazine: "The whole studio was in mortal silence."
West was called in as a last-minute replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West became confused when he sang "I Love It" dressed as a bottle of Perrier.
West was supported by Candace Turner, head of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: WE ARE THANK YOU WHO RESISTED IN THE NECK".
However, the show’s host, Karen Hunter, tweeted that West was just “his own self and that’s great.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe is embracing and espousing an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
So are we,” he added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "the being that was previously known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Didi, also known as Paph Daddy, Paffy and P. Didi.
The rapper Snoop Dogg had changed his name to Snoop Lion and of course the music legend Prince had changed his name first to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince.
Category of attempted murder for a knife attack on a restaurant in Belfast, United Kingdom
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a knife attack on a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balichacamor, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the prosecution.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington criticizes toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the swordsman John Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor criticized the stereotype of the hero, saying that such roles on the screen send the message to the little boys that they should be tough to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture magazine, Keith said "something is going wrong" and wondered how he could combat the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted to having a "strong opinion" on the matter.
"Personally, now, I believe it a lot. Where did we go wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we learn from men as they grow up, about the problem we're seeing now?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for increasing toxic masculinity because of the male characters it promotes.
He continued: "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television and on the streets that makes young boys feel that they have to show such behavior in order to be men?
I think it's one of the big questions of our time.
“Something has gone wrong with our young people.”
In the interview he also admitted that he does not intend to play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones, after the series ends next summer, saying "end to battles and horses".
From November, Kit will star in the revival of Sam Shepherd’s True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that his meeting with Rose's wife is the best thing he's ever done since Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so she kind of gave me my future family and my life from now on,” she said.
Rose played Ugkrit, John Snow's love-hate repulsive character played by Kit, in the Emmy-winning series.
The couple got married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health services.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, about 40,000 new cases were reported.
In their overwhelming majority, the new cases were transmitted through sexual contact, signaling a change from the past.
Traditionally, the HIV virus spread rapidly in some parts of China due to transfusions of contaminated blood.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way had almost zeroed, as officials from China’s health sector had said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, compared to the previous year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a very serious issue for China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination at the expense of the LGBT community remains a common phenomenon.
Because of the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many cases of transmission of these diseases are due to insufficient sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to anti-HIV drugs as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an executive leaked Republican senators' data, condemns "dangerous lies" and "conspiracy theories"
This Saturday, U.S. Representative Maxine Waters denied allegations that a member of her staff published personal information of three Republican senators on the lawmaker’s Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat argued that the claims were being made by commentators and “far right” websites.
“Lies, lies and even more horrible lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information reportedly includes the residence addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsay Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and appears to have been published by an unknown individual from the Capitol Hill environment during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against the Supreme Court nominee, Bret Kavaugh.
The leak occurred at some point after the three senators had questioned Cavano.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and published the data of a Waters staff member, The Hill reported.
“This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and blatant lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal information and security have been breached because of these fraudulent and false allegations, was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is a completely false and blatant lie.”
Waters' statement quickly received criticism on the Internet, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This shows that he doesn’t have the strength to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t be angry.
It doesn't have to be cowardice.
He must not question the motives of the one who accuses him.
It has to be calm and peaceful.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Cavano, who was accused by his critics of looking very angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's huge if it's real," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had notified "the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of these false allegations."
"We will do everything to find those responsible," he continued, "and to hold them accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to anyone and all members of my staff."
Johnny English Reprints - A Subtly Spying Movie with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for signs of Brexit in every new British film, and this seems to be true in this revival of the action-comedy film franchise with hero Johnny English, which began in 2003 with the film Johnny English and a remake of Johnny English.
Can this humorous self-pity about how obviously bad we are going to be the nation's new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny Ingles with his curly eyes was able to renew his permission to make them a mess for the second time. His name states that it is a wider comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinematographers.
It is, of course, the ajam secret agent who, while pretending to have the brilliance and manners of a secret agent, brings a little to Kluzos, with a dose of "Main Bean" and something of the type that played a single note in the musical theme of the film The Roads of Fiot.
It’s also based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once played in Barclaycard’s most forgotten television commercials, wreaking havoc on his journey.
There are one or two good moments in this latest JE movie.
I liked it when Johnny Ingles approached a helicopter dressed in medieval armor and the propellers hit his helmet.
Atkinson shows his talent in comedy, however, the humor is quite subtly and oddly over-the-top, especially at a time when "serious" film franchises like 007 and Dangerous Mission now include quite a few comedic elements.
Humor seems to appeal to children rather than adults, and in my opinion, Johnny Ingles’ crazy setbacks aren’t as inventive and relatable as Atkinson’s bogus film sketches for the character of Bin.
The eternal central issue is that Great Britain has a serious problem.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain’s super-secret spy network, instigating the identity of all of Britain’s agents on a mission, much to the disappointment of the agent on duty, who has betrayed him.
It’s the last straw for a pompous and ambitious prime minister on the verge of collapse due to political anti-popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this character reminiscent of Theresa May, but the script doesn’t help her much.
The intelligence advisers inform her that, as every active spy has been revealed, she will have to recapture someone unarmed.
And that means Johnny Ingles, who now works as a director at an aristocratic school, but gives unofficial lessons for secret agents: here there are some nice scenes, as Ingles offers a spy academy like A School of Many Rock.
Ingles returns to Whitehall for urgent information and reunites with his former and passionate partner, who is once again played by Ben Miller.
Bab is now married to a submarine commander, a crazy role in which however Vicki Peperdin is not fully utilized.
So, Batman and Robin of the Secret Service of His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, meeting the beautiful and fateful Ophelia Bouletova played by Olga Kirillenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is dangerously captivated by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s technological woes: the menacing Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacey.
Inglish and Baf begin the odyssey of their farsokomodi: disguised as waitresses, they set fire to a slick French restaurant, cause chaos as they try to illegally board Volta's luxury yacht, and on
All the tricks are used in this last scene, but as adorable and phasariosic as it is, it continues to remind a bit of children's television.
Moderate stuff.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I wonder: can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role where he’s really going to excel with his talent?
Workers deny they are considering a plan to work the British for four days, but to be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to consider a radical plan to get the British people to work four days a week, but to get paid for five-day work.
The party, according to information, seeks the bosses of the companies to channel the savings achieved through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers, giving them an extra day off.
Thus, employees will enjoy a three-day weekend, without any reduction in their salary.
Sources say the idea is in line with the party’s economic agenda and plans in order to turn the scales in favor of the workers.
The change to a four-day week was approved by the Congress of Workers’ Associations as a way to benefit workers from the changing economy.
A senior Labour source told The Sunday Times: “It is expected that a policy change will be announced before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but the four-day work week is an ambition aligned with the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of workers, as well as the party’s overall strategy for industry.”
The Labour Party is not the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day working week in its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this vision is not currently supported by the entire Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “The four-day working week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.”
The shadow government’s secretary, John McDonnell, used last week’s Workers’ Conference to develop his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from "inpersonal directors" and "profits" in the public benefit companies.
The shadow government secretary’s plans also mean that the current shareholders in the water companies may not take back their entire share, as a potential Labour government could be making “reservations” due to suspects.
He also confirmed the plans for placing employees on the boards of companies and the creation of mutual participation capital, in order to give 10% of private sector companies to employees who will receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds sterling.
Lindsay Graham and John Kennedy talk on 60 Minutes about whether the FBI investigation into Cavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Cavanaugh delayed the final vote on his candidacy for the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises the question of whether the agency’s findings could influence some Republican senators to resign.
In an interview on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a correspondent for the show 60 Minutes, asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could drill down on anything that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy appeared to be more open-minded than his colleague from South Carolina.
"Yes, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said that when I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Cavano.
I called him after the incident, when the complaint came out, and asked him directly, “Did you do it?”
He was unmoved, determined, categorical."
However, Graham’s vote does not seem to be going to change.
"I have decided on Brett Cavanaugh and it will take some explosive accusation to change my mind," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it," Graham added, referring to Christine Blaise Ford.
"And whoever has named him can't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival and how much has it contributed to poverty reduction?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a rich program and well-known stars, as well as an equally impressive mission: the eradication of global poverty.
For seven years now, tens of thousands are scheduled to flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park as part of the Global Citizen Festival, not only to enjoy artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true purpose of the event.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international pressure group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to secure a free ticket to the event (unless they were willing to buy a VIP ticket), interested parties had to complete a series of missions or "actions", such as declaring volunteers, sending an email to a global leader, making phone calls or soliciting other people to attend.
But how successful is Global Citizen, while there are still 12 years left to achieve its goal?
Is the idea of a reward with a free concert the right way to convince our fellow citizens to take action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism", when some people feel that they are really making a difference by signing an electronic request or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen group has reported that it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, promoting a range of different goals.
It reports that these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies amounting to more than $37 billion, which are expected to affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group reported 390 commitments and announcements as a result of these actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The team estimates that the secured funds have so far directly affected nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based association of investors and funders, who have undertaken the commitment “to help children fully exploit their potential”, pledging to give Rwanda $35 million over the counter.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and members of the Global Citizens community like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” Tracy Ulman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, said in a statement.
The group also said that following the more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called The Power of Nutrition, which targets 5 million women and children with nutritional disabilities.
Answering the question "what makes you think we can eliminate extreme poverty?" included in the site's FAQs,
A member of the Global Citizen community responded: “The road will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like all great movements for human rights and against apartheid before us, we will succeed, because united we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, Wicked, Sean Mendes, Cardi Bey and Janelle Mona are some of the artists to be featured at this year’s New York City event, which will be presented by Deborah-Lee Farnes and Hugh Jaxman.
U.S. May Use Navy to ‘Block’ Russia’s Energy Exports, Says Home Secretary
Washington may turn to its Navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from being deployed in the markets, including the Middle East, as U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke has revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke claimed that Russia’s involvement in Syria, where it is trying to do so at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
According to the Minister, there are ways and means to deal with Russian activity.
"The United States has the ability, with the support of the Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, to exclude them, to ensure that Russian energy is not made available on the market," he said.
Zinke was speaking to attendees at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group labeled as the “voice of the consumer of energy” in the United States.
He compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are essentially the same.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, little by little, the exploitation and replacement of fuels," he said, referring to Russia as "a ponie who knows only one trick", as it has an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements came as the Trump administration has taken on a mission to boost U.S. liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is the much cheaper option for European consumers.
For this reason, the Trump administration, including that of President Donald Trump himself, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that, according to Trump, will make Moscow’s Berlin “immaculate.”
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, a project with a budget of 11 billion dollars, which is going to double the existing capacity of the pipelines to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s strong resistance to the project is motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe that we share the view that energy cannot be a means of exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the supplier of gas they want," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak told a press conference after the meeting.
The U.S. stance provoked Germany’s reaction, which underscored its commitment to the project’s implementation.
Germany’s top industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to distance itself from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kebf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider the possibility of running for the presidency in 2020, says the senator from Massachusetts, who is currently in office.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would seriously consider running for the presidency after the mid-term elections, according to Reuters.
At a meeting at Holiouk City Hall in Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she was considering the possibility.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our troubled government, and that’s why we need a woman at the top,” she said.
"After November 6th, I will consider the possibility of a candidacy for the Presidency."
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the meeting, saying that "he is leading the country in the wrong direction.
“I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing in our democracy,” he said.
Warren didn't learn her words about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Cavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said that "of course an FBI investigation is necessary before the vote."
A poll published on Thursday, however, showed that the majority of Warren’s voters do not believe she should run for the presidency in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of Massachusetts’ “probable” voters said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32% were in favour of such a candidacy.
The poll showed more support for a possible candidacy than former Gov. Dewal Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a possible candidacy and 48 percent against.
Other popular names by Democrats discussed in relation to a possible 2020 candidacy are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who is also a member of the House of Representatives.
Biden said he would make a formal decision by January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin referred to Trak Palin's Post Traumatic Stress Disorder at Donald Trump's rally
Trak Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his recruitment in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on the night of Monday.
“With what my son has been going through since he returned, I can understand other families living with the effects of post-traumatic stress disorder and the injuries our soldiers carry when they return home,” he told the audience at the rally.
Palin described his arrest as "a bomb ready to explode" and said of her son and other veterans that "they come back a little different, they come back harder, they come back wondering if there is respect for what the soldiers have done for the country, every soldier."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, intervention in a report of domestic violence and gun ownership while in a state of intoxication, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Ghassi police department.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the challenge of the new asylum policy.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new U.S. policy that refuses to grant asylum to victims trying to escape gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the region submitted a report on Friday to amicus curiae in Washington supporting an asylum seeker to challenge the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy has not been revealed.
She said her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" were abusing her, however, U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
He was held in Texas.
Lawyers from the states that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, from which a large number of asylum-seekers come to the U.S., as countries facing acute problems with gangs and indolent.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed the 2014 decision taken by the Immigration Appeals Commission (BIA) and allowed undocumented migrants fleeing situations of domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Columbia District Attorney General Carl Rasin said on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
"According to federal law, all asylum applications must be considered on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application. Such a blanket violates this principle," the amicus curiae report said.
The lawyers also claimed in the report that the policy denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy, projecting the claim that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “constitute the necessary workforce.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to no longer grant asylum to victims trying to escape situations of domestic violence and gangs.
"The asylum is available to those who leave their country of origin because of persecution or intimidation due to race, religion, nationality or participation in a particular social group or political point of view," Sessions said in a June 11 announcement on the policy.
The purpose of the asylum was never to alleviate all the problems (even the most serious) that people face every day around the world.
Unprecedented rescue efforts in Palu, as the number of dead doubles despite the struggle to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation continued to deteriorate.
“It’s very intense,” said 35-year-old mother Riza Kousouma, trying to relieve her fever-stricken baby at an evacuation center set up in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulances bring in more bodies.
The clean water is scarce.”
Some residents tried to return to their ruined homes and collect their belongings through the water, trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and the hospitals, which suffered damage from the 7.5 magnitude Richter scale earthquake, were unable to meet the needs.
Some of the injured, such as Dewey Harris, who suffered a fracture of his waist and shoulder, remained outside the Army Hospital of Palos, where first aid was given in the countryside due to the ongoing strong post-earthquakes.
Tears flooded his eyes as he recounted how he felt the violent earthquake shaking the room on the fifth floor of the hotel that he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to be saved.
I was trapped in the rubble of the wall,” Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then silence prevailed.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “intimidation” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily newspaper outstripping the mutual trade benefits between the U.S. and China, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using it as a weapon.
U.S. President Donald Trump cited last Wednesday in China Daily’s paid-for insert that appeared on the Des Moines Register, the highest-selling newspaper in the state of Iowa, after accusing China of seeking to meddle in Congressional elections on Nov. 6.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing tried to meddle in the U.S. election signaled what U.S. officials told Reuters was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
Although it is not forbidden for foreign governments to publish advertisements to promote their trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a escalating trade war and have imposed various tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s tariff retaliation at the start of the trade war was aimed at hurting exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and a long-serving former governor in Iowa, a state that is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt America’s workers, farmers and businesses.
China, as Branstad wrote in an op-ed on Sunday’s Des Moines Register, is “inciting this kind of intimidation by publishing propaganda ads in our free press.”
“In an effort to spread this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America’s precious tradition of freedom of speech and the free press by publishing paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"On the contrary, in the stands of Beijing, you will find few dissenting voices and no true representation of the different views that the Chinese people may have about China's problematic economic course, given that the media is under the control of the Communist Party," he said.
He added that “one of China’s most important newspapers avoided the offer to publish” his article, though he did not reveal which one.
Republicans are estranged from women voters ahead of midterm elections because of fiasco with Cavano, analysts warn
As many top Republicans continue to defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh despite allegations of sexual abuse, analysts are warning that there will be a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiments on this issue are particularly tense and most Republicans have stated that they would like to move forward with the vote.
These things can't be restored," Grand Rieer, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill, referring to an article published Saturday.
Ryer doubts that Senator Jeff Flake’s move at the last minute to ask the FBI for an investigation will be enough to attract angry voters.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday, they’re not going to forget it tomorrow, and they’re certainly not going to forget it in November,” said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group, MoOve.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted the slogan “November is coming!” in the Senate aisle as the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee gave the green light for Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christophe Fior.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will reach record levels," Stu Rodenberg, a staunch political analyst, told the news site.
“They say it’s already high, and that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially in the group of indecisive women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, ages 18 to 29 who, while dislike the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony in which he detailed her allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts had predicted that there could be a backlash if Republicans moved forward with the bribery.
"It's a huge mess for the Republican Party," Michael Still, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said at the start of last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the vote on the committee or the final vote or whether Cavanaugh will be put out. It's also about how the Republicans handled the issue and how they treated it," said Gai Cecile, assistant to the U.S. State Department's special counsel, in a news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to who to believe after the depositions of Fortn and Cavano, fitting slightly more in favor of the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believed Ford’s deposition, while 35 percent said they certainly or probably believed Cavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Cavanaugh likely or certainly lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s move, the FBI undertook to investigate Ford’s allegations and at least one other whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Cavano attacked her while she was drunk when she was 17 years old.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her his genitals while they were at a party when they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup aimed at competing with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The new hallmark of this technology legend is Inrupt, a company based on Berners-Lee’s open platform Solids.
The Solid platform allows users to choose where their data will be stored, as well as who they will be able to access and what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intent behind Inrupt is “global domination.”
“We have to do it now,” he told the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid platform technology allowing users to create their own "personal electronic data storage" or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique feature of the personal data storage website is that it allows the user to decide who has access to what type of information.
The company calls this possibility “personal empowerment through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to offer resources, processes and appropriate skills so that the Solid platform is available to everyone.
The company consists of Burners Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some contracted developers who worked on the project, and a community of volunteer code developers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team do not talk to Facebook and Google about whether they are allowed to make radical changes, reversing business models in one night.
"We don't ask them for permission."
In a Medium post released on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that "Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will protect the integrity and quality of the new web created based on the Solid platform."
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a strong voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Even with Inrupt, Berners Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely optimistic about the next era of the Internet,” added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Van: Tribute to a clergyman who received the Cross of Victory in the First World War
The only clergyman of the Anglican Church to have received the Cross of Victory during World War I as a soldier was honored in his homeland 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann received the medal on 29 September 1918, for the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never learned that he had drawn the highest British military distinction.
On Saturday, a commemorative plaque was unveiled by his two grandchildren, which was accompanied by a parade in Rasden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandsons, Michael Van, said it was “extremely symbolic” that the plaque’s revelations were made exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s heroic act for which he received the medal.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van led his regiment to the Canal Saint-Quentin in the midst of a very dense fog and while receiving heavy fire from weapons of battle and machine-guns.
Later, he rushed to the front line and with "excellent manpower" drove the line forward, before striking himself with a weapon of battle three of the detachment.
Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, almost a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, said his grandfather’s heroic actions were “something I know I could never get to, it’s something that makes you feel boundless respect.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, also installed a wreath after the parade, which was led by the young Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he "felt a great honor to have participated in the parade" and added that "the bravery of a true hero is evidenced by the support he has from many people."
MMA fans stayed overnight to watch the Bellator 206, but saw Peppa the Whore.
Consider the following scenario: you’ve spent the night watching the exciting Bellator 206, but you’re devoid of the joy of seeing this one-of-a-kind sporting event.
The San Jose schedule included 13 games, including six on the main card, and would be played live in the UK, from Channel 5, in the night zone.
At 6:00 a.m., as Geghard Musashi and Rory McDonald were getting ready to go out into the ring, viewers in the UK were left shivering when the show switched to Peppa the Whore.
Some were not pleased at all, as they had stayed awake until the early morning hours especially for the match.
A fan on Twitter described the children's program's screening as "some sort of sick joke."
"Under the legislation, this content was not appropriate for 6 a.m., so the children's program had to be screened," Dave Blacks, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa the Whore, indeed."
Bellator’s president, Scott Cocker, said they were going to edit the program to include UK viewers in the future.
“If we think about the ripples, I think we can do it,” Cocker said.
"But it's six in the morning on Sunday there and we won't be able to do it until Sunday our own time, that is, their Monday.
But we're trying.
Believe me, when the change took place, a lot of messages were exchanged back and forth and they were not friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical error.
It wasn't, it was because of the rules.
I promise you, next time, this is not going to happen.
We're going to narrow it down to five games instead of six, as we usually do. We tried to offer more to the fans and we overcame it.
It’s an unpleasant situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Less’ Because of His Sexuality
The Olympian in the dives, Tom Daley, said he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, however, this pushed him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he hadn’t realized until high school that “not everyone is like me.”
Speaking at the first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne on Radio 4, she said she supported gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that since becoming a parent, he has been less interested in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, a regular presenter of the well-known radio show, was on sick leave for several months.
As a guest on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "unbalanced" compared to others when he was growing up, because "it was not socially acceptable for anyone to like both boys and girls."
He said: “Until today, these feelings of inferiority and diversity gave me the strength and the will to succeed.”
He wanted to prove it was “something,” he said, so he wouldn’t disappoint anyone when they finally learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medallist is a prominent advocate for the rights of the LOATKI community and took advantage of his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to move forward on decriminalising homosexuality.
He said he decided to speak because he felt lucky to be able to live openly, without impact, and that he wanted to give others “hope.”
The three-time world champion said he was "surprised" when he fell in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married Oscar-winning actor Dustin Lance Black last year, who is 20 years his senior, but argued that the age difference was never an issue.
“When you spend so much at such a young age” (he first participated in the Olympic Games at the age of 14, while his father died of cancer three years later) “it’s hard to find a peer who has similar good and bad traits.”
The couple adopted a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Daley said he changed "his whole perspective".
“If you asked me last year, all I wanted to do was win the gold medal,” he said.
“But there are more important things than the Olympic gold medals.
My gold medal in the Olympics is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they had made tickets for the 2012 Olympics in London, as he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him, ‘Dad, you’re not going to be around to sit in the front row,’” he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and only when he stopped breathing and was already dead did I finally accept that he was not invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I knew it was what I had been dreaming of all my life, to fight in the diving at the Olympic Games in my country, there was no better feeling," he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song, Heather Small's Proud, which refreshed him as he prepared for the Olympics and still causes him to shudder.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4, every Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out-of-form Mikkelson will sit on the bench on Saturday at the Ryder Cup
American Phil Michaelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to improve his performance so he doesn’t remember him for the wrong reasons.
Michaelson, who competes for the 12th time (record number) in the games held every two years, was forced by Chief Jim Furrick to sit on the bench for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as usual for the United States, the five-time winner divided the day to cheer up from the lines and "work" his game hoping to fix his troubled points.
Without ever having been the most direct driver even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old’s game is not suitable for the tight court of Le Golf National, where distance is often problematic.
And as if the difficulty of the field was not enough, Mikkelson, in the ninth match of Sunday, faces Francesco Molinari, champion of the British Open, who collaborates with the first-ever Tommy Flygwood to win the four weeks.
If the Americans, who were four points below the start of the 12 singles, can take the lead with a good start, Michelson’s game can be critical.
Furik expressed confidence in his player, not that he could say anything else.
“He fully grasped the role he plays today, hit me on the back amicably, put his hand around me and said he would be ready for tomorrow,” Furik said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
His name is in the Hall of Fame and he has offered so much to these teams, both in the past and this week.
I guess I didn't expect him to play two games.
I was thinking more, but that’s where we ended up and so we thought we had to go.
He wants to go out there, like everyone else.”
Mikkelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s record for most Sunday games in the Ryder Cup.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that didn’t reach the height of his individual record.
Mikkelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furik said his presence had benefits for the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make jokes and he’s great in the team room,” he explained.
"I think the younger players were also having fun to tease him this week. It was funny to see it.
His contribution is not just in the game."
The head of the European team, Thomas Byron, knows that the big lead may soon be lost.
Thomas Byorn, the head of the European team, knows from his experience that a big breakthrough starting from the singles of the last day in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a defeat.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 race at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros managed to take a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only managed to cross the final line with a chest difference, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2<0xE2><0x81><0x84>1.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderrama, we had a big lead at Le Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but just barely,” said Byorn, in the picture, after watching the 2018 generation win 5-3 at both National and Friday.
So the story will show me and all the team members that this is not over.
We're going to be ready tomorrow to give it our all.
We'll go out there and play right.
Nothing's finished until you see the points on the table.
We have a goal, to win this trophy, and that's where we focus.
I always say that I focus on the 12 players of our team, but we know very well that in the other team there are equally good players – the best in the world.”
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Byorn adds: "I wouldn't rush to betray the result.
Tomorrow's another beast.
Tomorrow counts the individual performance and that is something different.
It’s great to be on the court with a teammate when things are going well, but when you’re out there on your own, then you’re testing your skills as a golfer to the fullest.
This is the message you need to convey to the players, how to make the best of themselves tomorrow.
You leave your teammate behind and he has to give it all and show his best self.”
Unlike Byorn, Jim Furik from the opposing team will ask his players to score better individual performances than they had with their teammates, except for Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furik himself has experienced both ends of the setbacks of the last day, as he belonged to the winning team at Brookline before the unexpected defeat, as Europe did its miracle.
"I remember every word of his," he replied when asked how Ben Krenso, the leader in 1999, had amassed his players for the final day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want a quick start like at Brookline, like at Medinah.
When we get that momentum, there's a lot of pressure in the midterms.
We decide our series accordingly and play in the order that suits us, we will try to do our magic tomorrow.”
Thomas is set to lead the game and faces Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the rest of the Europeans in the top half.
“I went with this team in this series because I think it covers the whole route,” Byorn said, justifying his choices for the singles.
New delay for Germany's new warship
The new frigate of the German Navy should have been put into service in 2014 to replace the aging warships of the cold war era, but it is not going to be received until at least next year, due to faulty systems and inflated local costs.
The commissioning of the Rheinland-Pfalz frigate, the flagship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, which cites a representative of the armed forces.
The ship was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but problems with delivery were crucial to the fate of the ambitious plan.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
They will carry a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features are that the frequency of maintenance work is reduced, as it will be possible to use the new frigates for up to two years outside the German ports.
However, the continued delays mean that although warships are considered state-of-the-art, which will allow Germany to show its strength abroad, until they are finally put into service, they will already be obsolete, Die Zeit notes.
The ill-fated F125 frigate became a front page last year when the German Navy officially refused to take over the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after delivery.
Not much information has been made known about the reasons for the return, but the German media reported a number of significant "defects with software and hardware" that would render the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
The software problems were particularly significant; as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships have a crew of about 120 sailors, only half compared to the older Bremen class frigates.
It was also revealed that the ship has a much higher weight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz frigate is believed to have twice the weight of similar-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to the faulty equipment, the cost of the entire project (including crew training) was also an issue.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.6 billion), while the original budget was <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems that plague the new frigates are particularly important as Germany’s naval power shrinks.
Earlier this year, Hans Peter Barthels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, admitted that the Navy “will soon have no ships for missions.”
The official said the problem escalated over time because the old ships were decommissioned, but there were no other ships to replace them.
He claimed that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust hides the secret life of bats
New research conducted on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland seeks to uncover how bats use the landscape when hunting for food.
The findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and will contribute to the design of future actions to protect the environment.
The study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will explore the habits of the common nanon and micron nests, as well as the brown oocyte and Dobdenum myotids in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations around the estate to monitor the bats' activities throughout the season.
NTS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile searches using hand-held detectors.
The analysis of the sound of all recordings by experts will determine the frequency of the calls of bats, as well as what species have this behavior.
Then, a map of the habitat and an exhibition will be created to form a detailed picture of their behavior on a landscape scale.
Rob Dewar, a natural environment protection consultant for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of the habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by any species.
This information will help identify the benefits of habitat management, such as the creation of meadows and the best way to preserve forests for bats and other related species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly since the last century.
They are threatened by the construction works and development projects that affect the places where they rot and destroy their habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting are also a danger, as are fly-sticks and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by domestic cats.
The bats are not actually blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes to catch their prey.
They use an advanced sound detection technique to detect insects and obstacles in the course of their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, considers bats very important.
It has ten trained experts, who conduct regular surveys, inspect the places where bats gnaw, and sometimes save them.
The organisation has also created Scotland’s first and only bat-only shelter at the Threeve estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The estate’s manager, David Thompson, says the estate is the ideal ground for bats.
“Here at Threave we have an excellent area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of big trees and an ideal habitat.
There’s still a lot we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to grow their populations.”
He stresses that it is important to first check for the existence of bats before any maintenance work in homes, as the destruction of a single nest with small ones could kill up to 400 females and small ones, possibly eliminating the entire local population.
Bats are protected species and it is forbidden to kill them, harass them or disturb their silence, or to destroy their nests.
Elizabeth Ferrell, head of the Bat Conservation Trust in Scotland, encouraged the public to offer his help.
He said: “After much to learn about our bats and many of our species, we just don’t know the evolution of their population.”
Ronalto denies allegations of rape, as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo described the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying that some "want to self-profess" taking advantage of his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the complaints.
The attacker of National Portugal and Juventus is accused of raping an American woman, named Catherine Mayorga, in the room of a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
According to the complaint, he allegedly paid her $375,000 to buy her silence and not mention anything about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million fans after the complaint, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner said on camera.
"They want to self-promote and take advantage of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous by using my name, but that's part of my job.
I’m happy and all is well,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations he published, which they described as “unacceptable reporting of rumours touching privacy,” according to Reuters.
Attorney Christian Skerts said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage of a height commensurate with the seriousness of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years."
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronalto and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where they are said to have raped her by nature, according to documents filed with Clark County Regional Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her he was "99 percent" a "good guy" but betrayed the other "one percent."
The documents state that Ronalto admitted to having sexual intercourse, but that it was consensual.
Maiorga also claims that she went to the police and to a hospital where her injuries were photographed, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "afraid of the possibility of reprisals" and worried about her "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she is trying to reverse the settlement as she continues to suffer from post-traumatic syndrome due to the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of getting a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged abuse and this summer he moved to Italian Juventus to secure a deal worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret forever' the loss of auto industry <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
The UK “will regret it forever” if it loses its reputation as a global leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, said Enterprise Minister Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its plant in Burnastone, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese auto industry said the impact of cross-border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The plant in Burnastone, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models are manufactured, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop,” said Marvin Cook, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Bernastone.
Other automakers in the UK have expressed fears of leaving the EU without a deal on cross-border trade, such as Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, has said it will close the Mini factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern risks in the supply chain according to automakers in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line follows just-in-time. Spare parts arrive every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29th, there may be problems at the border, resulting in delays and a lack of spare parts according to the industry.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day’s stock at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May's plan for the future relationship with the EU "is specifically trying to resolve the issue of cross-border controls."
"We want the best possible deal that will allow us not only a temporary success, but also to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today show.
“The evidence that comes not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that the continuation of the supply chains must necessarily be ensured.”
Toyota has not been able to say how much it will stop production, however, it warned that in the long run the additional cost will reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnastone for 24 years and is Unite’s union manager at the factory, said the union members are increasingly worried: “In my experience, if these jobs are lost, they are never going to come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have presented an accurate and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, the White House has said.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be “delayed for another week” as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special investigator Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, Trump’s aides’ links with Russia, and the possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The possibility of Trump firing the deputy attorney general, putting Mueller's independence at risk, has been fueling Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of wearing a veil in order to record his conversations with Trump and make it possible to remove the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, last Monday he moved to the White House amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was delayed in order not to coincide with the hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on which both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment filed a lawsuit.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct an investigation within a week into the allegations against Cavanaugh, further delaying the conduct of a Senate vote.
Sarah Sanders, a Trump spokesman, appeared on the Fox News Sunday television show.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "No date has yet been set, maybe this week, but maybe another week of data on all other cases that the Supreme Court is dealing with.
But we'll see, after all, I like to always keep the guy up to date."
Some journalists have refuted this claim: Sanders has been holding a press briefing at the White House since September 10th.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why this is happening.
Sanders responded that the limited frequency of the updates was not due to a dislike of the “impression” movements of TV journalists, although she said: “I will not disagree with the fact that they are being shown.”
Then he let it be understood that there would be increased or direct communication between Trump and the press.
"The president gives more interviews than any previous president," he said, adding without citing details: "We looked at these numbers."
She said: “If the press has the ability to address questions directly to the President of the United States, that’s incomparably better than talking to me.
We've been trying to implement it often and you've seen that we've been implementing it often over the last few weeks and it's going to take the place of the press briefing where you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or press interviews with official visitors.
Individual press interviews are rare, however.
This week in New York, the president probably proved why this is happening, with an unconventional and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of gathered journalists.
Health Minister Sends Letter to EU Citizens Working on Scotland’s National Health System amid Fears of Brexit <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The Minister of Health has sent a letter to EU citizens employed by Scotland’s National Health System to express the country’s gratitude and to wish them to stay even after the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union.
Scottish MP Jean Freeman has sent a letter, with less than six months to go before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of applications for settled status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services. The UK government has already committed to cover the cost of applications for settled status for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: "During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued and are on the way to expected decisions in the autumn.
But the U.K. government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very difficult time for all of you.
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of every employee regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here."
Christian Abercrombie is undergoing an emergency surgery following a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers defender Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery following a head injury at Saturday's game, where the Tennessee State Tigers were defeated by a score of 31-27 by the Vanderbilt Commodores, as did the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the half-hour mark.
"He came to the counter and just collapsed there," Reed said.
The gymnasts and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen to the bench and then put him on a stretcher and moved him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee State executive told Chris Harris from the WSMV television station in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had come out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no evidence yet of the type/extent of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student under a limited-edition ("redshirt") regime, spends his first season in Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five total tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, thus reaching 18 total tackles for the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty for the purchase of real estate in the UK, while the extra money will be used to provide assistance to the homeless, according to new plans by Toris.
The measure will negate the success of Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters.
The increase in the stamp duty will be imposed on those buyers who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom

Foreign buyers will begin to be charged a higher stamp duty for the purchase of real estate in the UK, while the extra money will be used to provide assistance to the homeless, as Theresa May will announce today.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to negate the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises of providing more affordable housing and to target high-wage workers.
The increase in the stamp duty will be imposed on natural and legal persons who are not taxed in the UK, while the extra money will boost the government’s campaign to combat the lack of housing.
The increase, imposed on the current stamp duty, together with the highest tax rates introduced two years ago for the purchase of second homes and rental homes, may amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to bring in up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 per cent of newly built properties in London are bought by people who do not live in the UK, leading to higher prices and making it more difficult for first-time home buyers to enter the property market.
Many rich areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the stamp duty so that more young people can get their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of keeping property prices high, acquiring land without, however, using it, and called on Mrs. May to remove the ceilings on economic housing in order to restore Britain’s “housing shame.”
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of impressive proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and a ban on "blameless" expropriations.
He also wants to give greater powers to the councils in order to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my prime ministership to restoring the British dream - to improving life for every new generation.
And this implies the correction of the dissolved real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a life here.
However, it would not be right for individuals who do not live in the UK and companies based abroad to buy homes as easily as hard-working British nationals.
For too many people, the dream of home ownership has now become too distant and the unworthiness of the lack of a home remains.”
Jack Ross: "My absolute ambition is to coach the Scotland team"
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "absolute ambition" is to become the coach of Scotland's national team at some point.
The 42-year-old is excited about the challenge of resurrecting the North East England team, which is currently in third place in England's Third Division (League One), three points below the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in the summer, having previously brought St. Mirren back to the Scottish Championship the previous season.
“I wanted to fight for my country as a player.
I got a call for the second national team and that was it," Ross told Scotland's BBC on Sportsound radio.
“But I grew up watching the Scotland team in Hamden all the time with my dad as a kid, and that’s something that always pulled me back.
But this opportunity will only come if I succeed in training teams.”
Among Ross' predecessors in Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Alardys, Martin O'Neal, Roy Keen, Gus Pogett, and Paolo Di Canio.
Aloa Athletic’s former head coach says he didn’t feel awe when he was asked to follow such established names in such a large team, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this point, success for me will be measured based on the answer to the question 'can I bring this team back to the Premier League?'"
Due to the structure and facilities of this team, it undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy job to get her there, but I’ll probably consider myself successful here only if I can bring the team back there.”
Ross began his career as a coach just three years ago, having spent a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a period of 15 months on Harts coaching staff.
He then helped Aloa recover from the relegation to the third tier and led St. Mirren from the brink of relegation to the Championship win the following season.
Also, Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Folkerk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he said, recalling the position of Aloa’s coach.
“I really thought it suited me more to be a coach than a player.
It sounds strange because I was doing well, I was making decent money out of it and I had gotten quite high.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to endure a lot on a weekly basis.
I’m still struggling with the stress and pressure of the job, but my coach’s job fits me perfectly.
I’ve always wanted to train and now that I’m doing it, I feel more comfortable with myself than I’ve felt with myself all my adult life.”

The best time for beer is at 5.30pm on Saturdays, according to research
The summer heat boosted profits for Britain’s tried-and-tested pubs but brought more pressure to restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July, but restaurant profits fell by 4.8 percent, the figures revealed.
However, Peter Martin, from the CGA consulting firm that collected the data, said: "The continued sunshine and the greater than expected participation of England in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern to the previous month's, June's, June's.
The 1.8 per cent drop in restaurant revenues in June only worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that serve alcohol fared better, with the corresponding figures of previous years having risen more than the corresponding figures of restaurants have fallen.
The pubs that serve food also suffered on sunny days, though not as dramatically as the restaurants.
Looks like the world just wants to go out for a drink.
In all managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales decreased by three percent.
Paul Newman, from RSM’s recreation and hospitality analyst division, said: “These results verify the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors in terms of sales in the out-of-home market.
Unsurprisingly, restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a 4.8 percent drop in sales on an annual basis will be particularly painful given the ongoing cost pressures.
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for the catering business, and the weather will show whether the lower temperatures we experienced in August will give a much-needed extension."
The overall increase in sales to pubs and restaurants, including new businesses, amounted to 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launches.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales index for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyses efficiency data from 47 active groups, with a total turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 million in the UK and is the highest in the UK.
One in five children keep secret accounts on social media, secretly from their parents.
According to the research, one in five children – even as young as 11 – maintain secret social media accounts, secretly from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake pages ("fake Insta") on Instagram
This news has exacerbated fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they have a “main” account to show to their parents.
One in five children – even as young as 11 – create social media accounts, which they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid increase in fake accounts "fake Insta" - this is a reference to the Instagram photo sharing site.
This news intensifies fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they maintain a healthy “main” account to show to their parents, while at the same time maintaining private accounts.
A mother who accidentally found her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found a teenager who encouraged others to rape her (“rape me”).
The research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC Conference of School Directors and Directors in independent schools found that 40 percent of students aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, with half of them admitting to keeping hidden accounts.
HMC President Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers succumb to the temptation to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t spot them.”
Eileen Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish track council
Eillind Doyle was elected as a non-executive advisor to the Scottish Board of Trustees at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning track and field athlete and President Ian Beatty has commented on her election as a great opportunity for those who run the sport to benefit from her broad international experience over the past decade.
"Eilind enjoys immense respect throughout the Scottish, British and global community of steves and we are confident that the steve in Scotland will have a tremendous benefit from her entry on the board," said Bitty.
Doyle said: “I’m thrilled to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the gold medal in the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, having won a total of four Olympic gold medals and is now a regular commentator on the BBC, remained paralyzed after a transient ischemic hernia.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if and how much I will recover.
It was exhausting, but I completely recovered, I learned to walk again and today I do exercise!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!”
Advertising of a midwife who compares mothers with cows divides the online public opinion
A calf-producing company has divided online public opinion with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cow-breeding ones.
In order to launch the so-called "world's first silent and wearable cell phone", consumer technology company Elvie has released a humorous ad inspired by video clips to highlight the freedom it offers in the cell phone.
Four real mothers dance inside a haystack-filled cow barn, with a song that includes lyrics like "Yes, I'm making myself up, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't my boobs, they're my boobs."
The chorus continues, "Shut it up, suck it up, feed the babies, suck it up, suck it up, nurse my ladies."
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has sparked online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has garnered mixed reactions from viewers, as many say it doesn’t take the milk industry’s “horror” seriously.
"It's a very unfortunate decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their own babies steal it a few days after giving birth.”
Elvie's nipple fits discreetly inside a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Someone else commented: “Obviously traumatic for both the mother and the baby.
But yes, why not use them to advertise litters for mothers who can keep their babies?”
Someone else added: "An ad completely out of reality."
Others defended the ad, while a woman admitted that her song seemed "heartbreaking" to her.
“I think it’s a very smart idea.
I'd buy one like that if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel just like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I didn't sit down to overanalyze it.
It's a smart product," someone wrote.
Someone else commented: “It’s a funny ad that targets moms who are pumping breast milk (often in their workplace or in toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an ad that praises or criticizes the milk industry."
At the end of the video, the women’s team reveals that they were all dancing with the discreet veils buried in their bras.
The rationale behind the ad campaign is based on the idea that many women who pump breast milk with a diaper say they feel like cows.
Elvie, however, is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and discreetly fits inside a nursing bra, allowing women to move, hold their babies, and even get out during pumping.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Executive Creative Director at Mother, commented: “The Elvie Torch is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and challenging launch.
Making a parallel between lactating women and dairy cows, we wanted to put the focus on breast milk pumping and all the challenges it entails, while at the same time showing in a fun and relatable way the incredible feeling that comes with it.
This isn't the first time Elvie has been featured on the front page.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on the runway for fashion designer Marta Yakubovski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border.
The number of detained migrant children has soared, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it harder to match children with each other.
Traditionally, most conservatives are undocumented immigrants themselves, and they are afraid to go out and ask for a child and thus jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country.
The risk escalated in June, when federal authorities announced that potential conservatives and other adult members of their household would be required to give fingerprints and that the data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albens, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who have been asked to support unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had a white criminal record.
“Nearly 80 percent of people who are either maintainers or members of the maintainers’ household are in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to pursue these individuals,” said Mr. Albens.
Aiming to speed up the handling of children’s cases, the authorities introduced new rules according to which some of these children would have to appear before a court within one month of the start of their detention and not within 60 days, as was previously the case, in accordance with the law.
Many will appear through video conferencing, in place of face-to-face appearance, in order to develop their claims for the granting of legal status before the immigration court.
Those who consider that they do not meet the conditions for exemption will be deported immediately.
The more children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious or upset, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts, according to shelter workers and reports that have come out of the system in recent months.
Prosecutors said these concerns are intensifying in larger facilities such as Tornillo, where indications that a child is struggling are more likely not to be realized, due to the size of the facilities.
They added that moving the children to the tent without giving them enough time to prepare the children psychologically or to say goodbye to their friends could exacerbate the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw immediately
Addressing the General Assembly of the United Nations, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homeland, although the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil, under the guise of fighting terrorism and "will receive appropriate treatment."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, while millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "give this sacred battle until we expel all Syrian terrorists" from both terrorist groups and "every illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 soldiers in Syria, who mainly train and inform both the Kurdish forces and the Syrian Arabs who oppose President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the territory of a war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Mualem said conditions were good for their return and accused “certain Western countries” of “dispersing irrational fears” that pushed refugees to stay away from their country.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They’re politicizing an issue that should be purely humanitarian.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be given to rebuild Syria unless a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a demilitarized zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to advance political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented an extensive attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
Mualem, however, stressed that the deal had "clear deadlines" and expressed hope that the military actions would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who "will be fired".
U.N. envoy Stephane de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria soon and prepare the way for the elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the committee's work should be limited to "revising the articles of the current constitution" and warned that no interventions should be made.
Trump will win a second term.
With this logic, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again, unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, the motion of censure and scandals prematurely end his presidency.
That would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential finale of all time!”
So far, there are no signs of tiredness of the spectators.
Since 2014, the number of televisions in the high-vision zone has more than doubled, reaching 1.05 million on CNN and almost tripled, reaching 1.6 million on MSNBC.
The Fox News television network has an average of 2.4 million viewers in the high-broadcasting zone, while four years ago it had 1.7 million, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has screened the numbers on television.
It’s a fire that people are drawn to because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neil Baer, producer of the ABC drama series “Designated Survivor,” where a minister becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovel, a veteran comic book writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has a different theory.
He remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
He asked, "Why?"
"She said, 'Because it makes me laugh,'" said Mrs. Scovel.
One can have fun even with the chaos.
Of course, contrary to what is happening with the television series, the scenarios coming out of Washington can judge the future of the Roy v. Wade case, if immigrant families will be able to reunite and the health of the global economy.
The change of frequency is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can enjoy.
And yet, you go beyond the definition of an informed citizen when you're in a six-hour session with a team of experts discussing the use of "multiple interviews in the background" by Bob Woodward for his book "Fear" ("Fear"), the bomber jacket by Pol.
I, however, will never see Super Mario in the same way again.
"What makes you feel the reality of the show is that it gives you something every night," said Brad Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the TV show "Pawn Stars," about the constantly changing actors and actresses.
You don't have the luxury of missing an episode, or you're left behind.
When I met Mr. Flays this week, it was a sunny day with 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked in watching MSNBC while magnetizing CNN.
He couldn’t stand it, not when Brett Cavanaugh was going to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was hanging by a thread.
“I remember doing those crazy shows back in the day and people were saying, ‘This is going to be the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Flash told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right in the end."

Foreign money incurs in the most marginal match for the midterm elections
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th congressional constituency is receiving a cash flow, thanks to the rebalancing of congressional constituencies, which put two active congressional members in the same position.
This newly redesigned suburban district of Pittsburgh is represented by Democratic Representative Connor Lamp, who was elected to another district in special elections held last spring.
Lamp has as his opponent another active representative, Republican Keith Rothfus, who represents Pennsylvania’s former 12th electoral district, which largely coincides with the new 17th electoral district.
The maps were redesigned following a decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January that ruled that the old regions were being manipulated unconstitutionally in favor of the Republicans.
The election in the new 17th electoral district sparked a campaign of financial competition between the parties’ largest financial departments, the Democratic Campaign Committee for Congress (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamp became popular in Pennsylvania after he scored a landslide victory in a special election contest held in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, which was watched by many.
This position was held by Republicans for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the region by 20 points.
The political analysts give the Democrats a slight head start.
The United States looked into the possibility of punishing El Salvador for its support in China, but turned back
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, prompting mild reactions from Washington, D.C.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and kept a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization’s management team was deposed by the partners.
State Department officials have decided to recall the U.S. head of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," the spokeswoman said earlier in the day.
But it looked at imposing sanctions only against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug checks, development and financial support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted restrictions on passport visas, would be a pain for the Central American country, with high rates of unemployment and homicide.
As internal meetings developed, officials from North and Central America set up a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being, as a follow-up to a similar gathering that took place last year, which was seen as a step forward in the country's transition to the frontline.
However, in mid-September, top executives made it clear that they wanted to move forward with the conference, effectively putting an end to the thought of imposing sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is going to address the conference, which has now been scheduled for mid-October, in an indication of the great importance of the gathering for the administration, as diplomats have said.
All three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no further harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
The White House press secretary on Mr. Bolton's behalf declined to comment on the details of the discussion described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the internal deliberations of the House.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Read the story
The next blow may be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on the obstruction of justice by Mr. Trump, for which very strong evidence has now been made public.
It is rumored that Mr Mueller is also turning his investigation into the possibility of a trade-off between Mr Trump’s campaign and Russia over the Russian attack on our elections.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will be held accountable before this body as he prepares to reclaim the presidency in the next election and perhaps eventually before a sworn-in court.
The "ifs" are many and I do not mean that the fall of Mr Trump, nor of his bonds in Europe, is inevitable.
There are choices that we must all make on both sides of the Atlantic that will judge the duration of this battle.
In 1938 German officers were ready to launch a coup against Hitler, if the West had resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of slaughter that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and the unbridled course of democracy accelerates or slows down.
The Americans are now facing quite a few of these turning points.
What would we do if Mr. Trump fired Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who holds the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation in his hands?
Rosenstein has been in trouble ever since it was written in that newspaper that last year he proposed secretly recording the president and that he considered him unsuitable for the position of president.
Mr. Rosenstein said the version the Times had adopted was inaccurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s recently requested investigation of Brett Cavanaugh is not complete or fair or if he is appointed to the Supreme Court despite the reasonable allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will enter a long winter.
But because of the lesson I took in The Thing, I don't think we're going to fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was transferred to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my embassy home.

Rangers' Graham Dorans is optimistic about the fight with Rapid Wiener <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
The Rangers welcome Rapid Wien on Thursday, knowing that the win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain with the Villarreal earlier this month, will give her a lot of chances for a qualification from the 7th Group of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented the midfielder Graham Dorans from making his first appearance in the season until a 2-2 draw with the Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for greater success.
“It was a good moment for us because Vieira is a good team,” the 31-year-old said.
“We got into the game believing we could achieve something and we came out with a degree.
Perhaps we could escape in the end, but in general, the tie was a rather fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we were better in the second half.
Now, Thursday is another great European night.
Well having things, we can get three points, but it will be a difficult game because they brought a good result in their last game, but, with the world on the stage, I'm sure we can do our best and bring a positive result.
“Last year was definitely difficult because of my injuries and the changes that were made to the team itself, but there is a positive feeling now.
The team is good and the kids enjoy it, the training is good.
Let’s hope that we can do our best now, let’s leave last season behind and succeed.”
Women are losing their sleep because of their fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that the participants in the study had a clear idea of how they would like to receive care, few discussed it with their family.
Nearly half of the participants in the Nationwide survey said they were talking to their husbands about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about it.
“People want to be cared for by their family, but they don’t take the initiative to have the conversation,” said Holly Schneider, vice president of Nationwide’s life insurance business.
Start with that.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t express your wishes much earlier.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you will receive care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Bring your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your financial options for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance at a takeover price to help you cover these costs or self-insurance with your own property – as long as you have the money.
Prepare Your Legal Documents: Avoid Legal Disputes.
Make a power of attorney for health care issues so that you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that health professionals will comply with your wishes in case you are unable to contact them.
Also, consider the possibility of making a proxy for your finances.
You can choose a trusted person in order to make financial decisions on your behalf and to ensure that your accounts are paid, in case you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent is facing an emergency health problem and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Please include these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the finances, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What are the drugs?
Who will take care of the dog?
Be sure to prepare this plan.”
Man Received Multiple Gunfires in Ilfracombe, Germany
A man received multiple gunshots with an air gun as he was walking towards his home last night.
The victim, aged about 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon County when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the incident, which took place at 02:30 British Summer Time, as a "random event".
The victim did not see the perpetrator of the attack.
The injuries he suffered are not life-threatening and the police are calling for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to official sources, while the number of victims is expected to increase.
With communications cut off, humanitarian forces have failed to receive information from Dongala, an area north of Palu, located closer to the center of the 7.5-degree Richter scale earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Dongala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, located on the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Dongala is a tributary that extends along more than 300 kilometers (180 miles) of coastline to the southwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The kingdom, a degree of administrative division under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 inhabitants in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of the central Sulawesi province and especially in the coastal area of Dongala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it is more common in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawezi.
Palu and Dongala have been hit by a tsunami several times in the past 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Management Service.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Dongala.
Tsunami also hit western Dongala in 1996, causing the deaths of nine people.
Indonesia is located within the seismic Ring of Fire in the Pacific Ocean and is often affected by earthquakes.
Some of the largest recent earthquakes and tsunamis are as follows:
2004: A large earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia’s Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26th caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, while more than half of them are in the Indus Ocean.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late May and early April.
Hundreds of dead on the island of Nia, near the shores of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-degree earthquake on the Richter scale struck the southern part of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale centered near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale struck one of the Medway Islands, near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and cost the lives of about 300 people.
2016: A low-level earthquake struck the Pindi Jaya area of Aceh, causing disaster and panic, as it brought to the world memories of the disaster that erupted in the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but more than 100 people were killed by collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lobok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake has destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily abandoned.
Sarah Palin's First-born Son Arrested for Domestic Violence
Trak Palin, the eldest son of the former governor of Alaska and a candidate for the vice presidency, Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
The 29-year-old Peylin, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested as a suspect in domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence charges, and resistance to the authorities, according to a report released Saturday by police (Alaska State Troo).
According to the police report, when a woman known to him tried to call the police to report the crimes he allegedly committed, she grabbed the phone from her hands.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su temporary detention facility, with a $500 guarantee, as reported on KTUU television station.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he was "certainly, innocent" when asked, according to the network.
Palin faces charges for three Class A offenses, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class A felony, which is punishable by a one-day jail term and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time he's been prosecuted against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case has now been brought before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of a complaint for the criminal offence of domestic violence and possession of a gun, while he was in a state of intoxication.
His partner claimed that he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin received criticism from groups of veterans in 2016 when she linked her son’s violent behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Friday.
The 7.5-degree earthquake on the Richter scale caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut off, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck near the central Sulawesi, located northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
In social media, videos from the moment of the devastating event are being released.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach party in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
U.S. Attorneys Seek Rarely Imposed Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Attack in New York City
Federal prosecutors in New York are calling for the imposition of the death penalty on Saifoulos Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people - a rare punishment that has been imposed on the state for the crime.
Saipoff, 30, allegedly used a rental van from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a bike path along West Side Avenue in Lower Manhattan, dragging pedestrians and cyclists who were found on his road on Oct. 31.
In order to justify the death sentence, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov killed the eight victims "intentionally" and caused serious bodily harm "intentionally", according to the statement of intent to impose the death penalty, filed in the court.
Both of these charges carry the death penalty, according to the transcript.
Years after the attack, a federal jurors’ body brought Saipov face-to-face with a 22-point indictment, which included eight counts of manslaughter in favor of a criminal organization, a tactic often applied to indicted federal prosecutors and prosecutors.
The attack required "significant planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing the way Saipoff carried out the attack as "terrible, cruel and obscene."
"Saifoulo Hamiboulavi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused pain, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Henrique Anhelini, An-Lor Dekad, Daren Drake, Ariel Erlich, Ern.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the last time the New York Southern District Court prosecuted a case that carries the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was imposed for a federal case in New York was in 1953 on the wives of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to carry out espionage in favor of the Soviet Union two years ago.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saif, a Uzbek national, appeared to be irrevocable in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he was satisfied with his act, according to the police.
Saif told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack by ISIS video he saw on his cell phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to set the flag of ISIS in his hospital room, according to police.
He pleaded not guilty to the 22 charges listed in the indictment.
David Patton, one of the federal public prosecutors representing Saif, said he was "apparently disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the imposition of the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence conviction with no possibility of release will simply prolong the trauma caused by the events for all those involved," Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to request the imposition of the death penalty.
Tories MP says NAITZEL FARATZ should head Brexit negotiations <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
Nigel Farage vowed to "mobilize the people's army" today during a rally at the Tory Congress.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party (UKIP) said politicians should "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics, as one of Theresa May's MPs said he should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bowen told protesters in Birmingham that the UK "would have already come out" by now if Mr Farage were the Brexit minister in charge.
But the challenge that Mrs May faces in her attempt to reconcile her deeply divided MPs was underscored by the fact that advocates of staying in the EU, Toris, participated in a separate rally against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep the Chequers compromise plan under control amid attacks by Brexit supporters, supporters of staying in the EU and the EU.
The allies insisted on moving forward with its attempt to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the reactions, and to force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos”.
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave protest rally in Solihull that he wanted to fly "the Chequers plan."
He said that Mr Farage should have been granted a title of nobility and given powers to negotiate with Brussels.
"If we were in charge, we would have already left now," he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit but we have to throw out the Chequers plan.”
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he said: "We have not fought in world wars to become subjugated.
We want to make our own laws in our country.”
Mr. Bowen rejected the claims that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: "The assumption that the British people have changed their minds and wish to stay is completely false."
Brexit advocate Tory MP Andrea Jenkins was also at the rally and told reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan doesn’t have the approval of the general public, the Opposition isn’t going to vote for it, it doesn’t have the approval of our party and our activists who go down the streets and ultimately vote for us.
Please leave the Chequers plan and start listening to it."
With a sharp message to Mrs. May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises."
Farage told the rally that politicians should be forced to "feel the pressure" if they are prepared to betray the decision taken with the 2016 referendum.
"There is now a question of trust between us - the people - and the class of our politicians," he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with it if you do that.’
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make the class of our politicians, who are preparing to betray Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are mobilising the people’s army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we become an independent, sovereign and proud United Kingdom.”
Meanwhile, supporters of staying in the EU demonstrated in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Few activists waved a Toris anti-Brexit banner after the group's rally this weekend.
Labour MP Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over the security issues they faced with an implementation of the party at the start of the congress.
“They are the same people who tell us that they can put into operation the information systems and all the technological means needed for the EU-Canada Type Agreement with enrichment, for the unfettered borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's an absolute fiasco.
“Brexit is not good,” he added.
Warren plans to take a serious look at the possibility of running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will seriously consider running for president after the November election, but she's not sure if she'll run for president.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democratic senator from Massachusetts spoke about her future plans during a rally at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who frequently criticises President Donald Trump, claims her re-election in November, with opposition from Republican State Representative Jeff Dill, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It is widely believed that he could face Trump in 2020.
The event on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters using the structures of the city hall since Trump’s term began.
One attendee at the rally asked her if she planned to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that the time has come “to go to Washington women to make up our broken government and that means a woman has to be at the top.”
Arrest for the fatal shooting of the LSU Sims basketball player
Police in Baton Rouge, Los Angeles, on Saturday announced the arrest of a suspect in the fatal shooting of LSU basketball player Wade Simms on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Ditton Simpson in a press conference at 11 a.m. (Eastern Time Zone).
They posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying the man who appeared in the video.
The 20-year-old Sims was fatally shot near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
“Wade Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head, which led to his death,” police chief Murphy J. Paul said in a statement on Saturday, according to the 247sports website.
Wade intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was at the scene having the gun in his possession and confessed that he shot Wade Simes.
Simson was arrested without protest and is being held in the Police Department of the East Baton Rouge neighborhood.
Three-year-old Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, with 10 appearances as a key player last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton goes for world title as his team's instructions gave him the victory over Sebastian Fettel
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas passed in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team’s orders would play an important role in the race.
At the start Botas had a good start and almost hung Hamilton, as he defended his position in the first two turns and called for Fettel to attack his stable.
Fettel went first in the pit and let Hamilton run in the race line, which should be decisive.
Mercedes went to the pit one lap later and came out behind Fethell, but Hamilton came out ahead after a wheel-to-wheel battle, which forced Ferrari's driver to reluctantly abandon the interior due to the risk of succumbing to the double-motion violation to overtake.
Max Ferstaben started from last place and was seventh at the end of the first lap on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then remained first for a large part of the race, as he held his tyres aiming to finish quickly and pass in front of Kimi Raikonen in fourth place.
He eventually went to the pit in the 44th lap, but was unable to increase his speed to the remaining eight laps, as Harrison came fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri was fantastic all weekend and he was a real gentleman who let me pass.
The team did a great job and did one or two," Hamilton said.
The body language was very bad.
President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not leak Christine Blaise Ford’s letter, in which she accused the Supreme Court nominee, Bret Kahlwath, of being a criminal.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what was being said in the Senate proved that people are "cooperative and corrupt."
"The only thing that could happen is this beautiful thing that's been happening in the Senate these last few days, where you see anger, you see people who are angry and misguided and miserable and liars," he said.
"When you see posts and leaks and then they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Diane Finstein, did you make the leak?
Remember her answer... you leaked the document-- "oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't spill it."
Well, wait a minute.
If we escaped...No, we didn't escape," he added, mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received a letter from Ford containing details of the charges against Cavanaugh in July and she leaked earlier in September — but Feinstein denied that the leak was made by her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't spill her story," Feinstein told the committee, as reported in the Hill newspaper.
"She asked me to keep it secret and I kept it secret as she asked me to."
But her denial did not seem to particularly convince the president, who commented during Saturday's rally: "I'll tell you something, the body language was very bad.
He may not have done it, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the candidate for the Supreme Court, who was accused by three women of sexual harassment, the president let it be understood that Democrats are using the charges to serve their own purposes.
“They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the malice, the misery, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to trample in order to take power and control,” the president said, according to the news website Mediaite.
Elite League: Dante Starr 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer has scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dandy Starr took apologetics for her defeat in Friday's Elite League match by the Belfast Giants, winning the rematch 5-3 at Dandy on Saturday.
The Giants took an easy two-goal lead with a shot from Patrick Dwyer and Frances Beauviere.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cowney brought the tie for the fielders before Dwyer retook the lead of the Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard equalized for Dundee and then two goals from Lucas Ludwig Nilsen secured the team's victory.
It was the third defeat in the Elite League in the season for Adam Kief's men, who came in with a 2-1 victory over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants having won the previous three games.
Dwyer opened the score in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFall's assist, while David Rutherford gave the assist thanks to which Bowier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In an uphill period full of action, Sullivan put the home team back into the game at 13:10 before Matt Markward gave the assist for the draw from Kauny at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the lead for the Giants in the first half when he scored his second goal for the night towards the end of the first period.
The home team was regrouped and Bouchard equalized again with a power show goal at 27:37.
Kauny and Charles Corcoran joined forces to help Nilsen take the lead in Dundee for the first time in the race towards the end of the second period and he secured the win with his team’s fifth goal in the middle of the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost in four of their last five games, are playing at home with Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air Traffic Controller Loses His Life to Save Hundreds of Plane Passengers from an Earthquake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is declared a hero as he lost his life in an effort to ensure the safe take-off of a plane carrying hundreds of passengers.
More than 800 people were killed and many are missing as a result of a major earthquake that hit the island of Soulawezi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong earthquakes continue to hit the area and many have been trapped in ruins in the city of Palu.
But even though his colleagues ran to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonius Gunawan Aung refused to abandon his position at the manipulative control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
It remained in place to make sure that Batik Air’s flight 6321, which was in the runway at the time, could be safely taken off.
Then he jumped out of the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Joannes Siret said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian broadcaster ABC News.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
"We are shocked by his death," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the dead could be thousands, while the country's disaster management service says access to the cities of Dongala, Sigi and Butong is limited.
"The death toll is expected to rise further as many bodies are still under rubble, many of which we have not been able to reach," said Sutopo Purwoo Nugroho, a spokesman for the ministry.
Waves that reached six meters destroyed Palou, which will hold a mass burial ceremony on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring in aid and supplies.
Riza Kuzouma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance brings in bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jean Gelfand, president of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is fighting to save survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
What happened is already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said to the country’s army: “I ask you to work night and day to complete any work related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he told CNN.
Indonesia was hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lobok, which claimed the lives of more than 550 people.
Previous articleAir Niugini says man is missing after plane crashes in lake, says plane crash in Micronesia
The airline, which was conducting a flight that crashed in a Pacific seaport in Micronesia, now reports that a man is missing, while earlier it said that all 47 passengers and crew members had safely evacuated the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press release that since Saturday afternoon it has not been able to find the traces of a passenger man.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline did not respond directly to requests for more information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats from the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane hit the water as it tried to land at the Chuk Island airport.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been taken to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital on Saturday and the condition of all of them was stable.
The causes of the conflict and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
Both the airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon off the runway.
Some eyewitnesses believed that the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Janes said the plane went down too low.
"This is extremely good," said Janes.
Janes said he and others were able to make their way through the water reaching them to the middle of the emergency escape exits of the plunging plane.
He said the flight attendants were panicking and screaming and he suffered a slight head injury.
The U.S. Navy said some sailors working nearby to improve a wharf also helped in the rescue by using a inflatable boat to transport people to shore before sinking the ship at a depth of about 30 meters (100 ft).
According to data from the Air Safety Network, 111 people have lost their lives in airline collisions registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none of these collisions involved Air Niugini.
An analyst cites the time frame of the night when a woman burned alive.
The indicting authority completed its procurement on Saturday at the retrial of a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett has been a consultant in the field of information analysis for hours.
She explained to the jury how she used mobile phone records to put in order the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death.
Roulet said he received location records from several mobile phones showing that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, disputing his previous claims, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers' cell phone the time he claimed he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified as a witness on Saturday and said he was not in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said "he was lying, because my truck was in Nashville."
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he knew Chambers about two weeks before her death.
Mobile records showed they only knew for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact details from his phone.
"He deleted her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is going to start buying it on Sunday.
The judge said he estimates that later that day the trial will be put on the jury trial.

A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative opinion that prevails about the genre, filling their music with positive messages.
High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop has escaped from its roots, which were political messages and tackling social issues.
They want to go back to its roots and make the conscious hip hop popular again.
Artists such as Fugees and Common are experiencing a recent recovery in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.

Dada in New York City Sues Couple Who Fired Her After Receiving ‘Racist’ Message
A New York-based nanny is suing a couple for racist dismissal after receiving a message accidentally sent to her by her mother complaining that the nanny was "another black man."
The couple denies that they are racists, likening the case to "extortion."
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, was disappointed when she realized that the new nanny, Giselle Morris, was black as soon as the last one showed up for her first day at work in 2016.
"OXIIIIII THE OTHER BLACK," wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a message to her husband.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris and even twice.
As soon as she realized her gap, the now awkward Mr. Plasco-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, stating that their outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had not done a good job at all and was waiting in her place for a Filipino woman, according to the Post.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her one and only day’s work and then sent home with Uber.
Now, Mrs. Morris has filed a lawsuit against the couple seeking compensation for the termination and is seeking compensation of the order of $350 a day for the six-month-long work as an in-house nanny, for which she was originally hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that, look, you can’t do things like that,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discreet treatment.”
The couple refutes allegations that they are racist, saying it was reasonable to fire Morris, as they feared they would not be able to trust her again after she was assaulted.
"My wife sent her something she didn't want to send her.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you had offended, even if by mistake?
Your new-born baby?
Come on now."
Similaring the treatment to "expropriation," Plasco said his wife had just given birth two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation."
"Would you hunt someone who's in this situation?
It's not that kind," the banker added.
While the legal case is ongoing, the court of public opinion has rushed to convict the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The editors of Pantington feared that readers would not be interested in a talking bear, as a new letter reveals.
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who was reading it for the first time before it was published.
It’s a lot of fun when you know what we know now about the huge success of Pantington.”
She said her father, who worked as an illustrator at the BBC before being inspired to write the children's book from a furry bear, was optimistic about his work, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's release was "smooth from the past", as the book was "smooth from the past".
Regarding Pantington, whom she describes as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was secretly proud of his subsequent success.
"He was a pretty quiet man and he wasn't superstitious," he said.
“But because Pantington was so true in his eyes, it was almost like having a child who accomplishes something: you’re proud of it even if it’s not your own achievement in reality.
I think that's kind of how he saw Pantington's success.
Although it was a creation of his own and of his imagination, he always gave the credit to Pantington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Hospital of Nice Louis Pasteur 2, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nand kept calling and telling me it was very bad, that he didn't have much hope of making it," Ms. Ednan-Laperuz said.
“At some point Nand called me to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Tassi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart alive were slowly diminishing and coming out of her body.
He had already died a little while ago and at that time and now everything was gone.
I just had to sit there and wait, knowing this was all happening.
I couldn’t scream, scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to stay cool.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperuz, who so far mourns the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, who ignored the ordeal she was going through.
"Nobody knew," he said.
"I had my head down and they were crying all the time.
It's hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I felt a sense of compassion for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women who mourn the loss of their own faces hang cards on a bridge to prevent suicides.
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to stop other people from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys hang on a bridge in Wales cards with inspirational messages and phone numbers that one can call to get support.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when she began suffering from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” he said.
The 45-year-old Mr. Davis, who lives in Lindney, said her son was a very promising chef, with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile lit up the room."
However, he quit his job before he died, as "he was in a very bad state".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was then 11 years old, was the one who found his brother after he had ended his life.
Mrs. Davis said, "I'm always worried there's going to be an impact."
Mrs. Davis created the cards "to inform the world that there are people out there you can go and talk to, even if they're your friends.
Don't be silent - you have to talk."
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Mrs. Davis for many years, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say you felt down or sad or anything like that,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He had taken a deep breath on Christmas Day — when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t look them in the eye.”
He said his death caused them a huge injury, but they have to overcome it: “It breaks up the family.
It's crushing us.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

The future of Brett Cavanaugh is uncertain as the FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could really achieve something like what he was asking for — a limited-duration, limited-objective survey — maybe we could bring in a little unity,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be broken up in the middle of a stalemate.
Why didn't Mr. Cavanaugh and his Republican backers want to investigate the FBI?
Their reluctance is entirely due to the time frame.
The mid-term elections are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if, as expected, the Republicans are not doing well, they will be significantly weakened in their efforts to achieve the election of the person they want in the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush calls Senators, urging them to support Mr. Cavanaugh, who was working in the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him met Ashley's wife, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report is presented?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently consists of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr Cavano can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to get the majority and secure his appointment to the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of apostates falls under Kim's rule
The number of apostates from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong Un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s unification ministry, said there were 1,127 separations last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the stricter border controls between North Korea and China and the higher charges of smugglers were key factors in the move.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of apostates from North Korea are finally offered the citizenship of South Korea.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the largest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily-protected Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea.
China considers the apostates illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often expels them by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are typically still at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to talk about the negotiations on denuclearization, which have been delayed.
The meeting came after the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms to work together to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Rim Jong Il accused U.S. sanctions of a lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances, we will in no way disarm our country unilaterally first,” Mr. Rim said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Bret Cavanaugh "hysterical", says he is unfit to serve in Supreme Court
Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Speaker of the House of Representatives, called the Supreme Court candidate Bret Cavano “hysterical” and said he was inherently unfit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman behaved this way, they would call her 'hysterical'," Pelosi said of Cavano's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Cavanaugh, with intense emotion, denied the allegations that he had committed sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blazy Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his initial purchase, Cavano was deeply moved, sometimes almost screaming, and his voice trembled as he talked about his family and his school years.
He also vehemently condemned Democrats on the committee, describing the charges against him as a "monstrous and coordinated political assassination of a character" organized by liberals who have been angered by Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Cavanaugh’s testimony proved she can’t serve in the Supreme Court, as she showed she is biased against Democrats.
“I think he shut himself out with these statements and in the way he did against the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi responded when asked if she would try to impeach Cavano if his appointment was confirmed and if Democrats would win a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will say this - if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he is not suitable not only for the Supreme Court, but also for the court in which he is serving right now," Pelosi said.
Cavano is a judge at the District Court of the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals).
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Cavanaugh's possible decisions regarding the Affordable Care Act or the Roy v. Wade case, as she is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearings to confirm his appointment, Cavano declined to answer questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court rulings.
"It's not time for a hysterical, prejudiced man to go to court and wait for us to say, 'Isn't it wonderful?'" Pelosi said.
And women must have it in their possession.
It’s a justified outburst, months and years of rage overflowing and he can’t get it out of her without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't find it unusual, do you?"
He went on to say, "I was greatly helped by a woman who was a staff member somewhere, who said that she too cried when she was angry, but had developed a technique according to which when she was angry and started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You may think I am a thief.'
I'm angry."
And so he just kept going.
And I thought it was great."
Tears are allowed as an outburst of anger in part because they are basically misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of a job I did long ago, in an office dominated by men, is a time when I cried in unspeakable rage and was snatched from my throat by an older woman - a cold director who always frightened me - and cried at me.
"Don't ever let them see you cry," he said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they broke it."
Patricia Shredder, then a Democratic senator from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his campaign for the presidency.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an extramarital affair on a ship called Monkey Business and left the fight humiliated, Mrs. Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, deeply disappointed, thought there was no reason not to.
“It wasn’t such a wise decision,” he told me, laughing, 30 years later.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another nomination.
Someone described the situation as "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because the campaign had already begun a long time ago, he was back in funding and so he swore he would not enter the election race if he had not raised $2 million.
The battle was lost.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, gave her only $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he wondered.
In her speech in which she announced that she would not launch an official campaign, she was very intensely charged with feelings - gratitude for the people who supported her, disappointment with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and the targeting of voters against her.
"You'd think I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der recalls of the press' reactions to her.
“You would think Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
"Crying"?
How the U.S.-China trade war can do good in Beijing
The salutary trade war between the U.S. and China has been grueling, and while the battle has much more to end, a breakup between the two countries may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year, taxing key Chinese export products, including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The biggest escalation took place this week, with new tariffs on $200 million (<0xC2><0xA3>150 million) worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all products imported into the U.S. from China.
Beijing is returning the fire every time in kind, while it has recently imposed tariffs of five to ten percent on goods worth $60 million.
China is determined to retaliate against U.S. fire and the world’s second-largest economy is unlikely to put it down anytime soon.
In order to get Washington to back down, it would have to give in to their demands, but bowing publicly to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, China’s president.
But, according to experts, if Beijing can play its cards properly, U.S. trade war pressures could prove positive for China in the long run by reducing the interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a hasty political decision either in Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for an economic collapse in either country is actually a far more dangerous one than observers have admitted in the past,” said Abigail Grace, an American research associate at the Center for Security Studies.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, according to Foreign Minister
Syria claims to be ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by the seven-year (and now) war.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is more stable and secure thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate the areas destroyed by the terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All the conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who were forced to leave due to terrorism and the unilateral economic measures that plagued their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the war broke out in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mualem said that aid for the reconstruction of the destroyed country is welcomed by the Syrian government.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 versus 10.5 at Le Golf National golf course, outside Paris in France.
The U.S. team has now been defeated six times in a row on European soil and has won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took first place again, as the team of Danish leader Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
U.S. team star Phil Michaelston, who fought hard for the longest time in the tournament, threw his shot into the water in the par-3 16th hole, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shined in all his rounds and thus became 1 of the 4 players who have achieved 5-0-0 since the current form of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Speth was defeated in 5&4 by the lowest ranked player of the European team, Danish Thorbjorn Olsen.
The player with the best ranking in the world, Dustin Johnson, scored 2 and 1 against Ian Pullter from England, who may have played his last game in the Ryder Cup.
Spanish veteran eight-cup rider Sergio Garcia was crowned the most successful European of all time in the tournament with a total of 25.5 points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t hold on.
It's been a rough year.
I'm grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very happy that we got the cup back.
It’s all for the team and I’m glad I was able to help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He gives the thumbs up to his compatriot John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a one-on-one game on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up admiring this guy,” said 23-year-old Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a record-breaking career in the Ryder Cup 13-21-3.
Unusual statistics for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and has only been surpassed by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find a goal, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Fine, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Chief Jim Farick spoke after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these kids, they fought it.
At some point this morning we put a lot of pressure on Europe.
We fought hard.
Congrats to Thomas.
He's a great leader.
All 12 players played very well.
We will regroup, we will work with the PGA USA and the Ryder Cup Committee and we will move forward.
I love these 12 kids and am proud to be their leader.
We have to admit it.
They were better than us.”
