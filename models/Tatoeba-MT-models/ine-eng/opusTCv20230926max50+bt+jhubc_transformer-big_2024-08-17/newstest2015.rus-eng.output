India’s new prime minister, Narendra Modi, is meeting with his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, in Tokyo to discuss economic and security ties, as part of his first serious foreign visit since winning the elections in May.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world’s third-largest economy.
At the top of the agenda are plans to expand nuclear cooperation.
India is also reportedly hoping for a defence cooperation agreement between the two countries.
FANO Russia will hold the final Expert Session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) together with the RAS will hold the third Expert Session "Evaluation of the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations".
The meeting will be final in a series of meetings held by the agency during the year, according to a press release received by the editorial board of Lenty.Ru.
At the third meeting, it is planned to summarize the work of the Expert Session for the year and to form a final list of indicators for assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
Separately, the participants of the event plan to discuss the rules for the formation of expert groups responsible for conducting the evaluation of the work of scientific groups, and the criteria for conducting evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events on the formation of a common approach for all three academies to the methodology of assessing the performance of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded, and the final version of the regulatory documents is in agreement.
At the end of the next session, we must complete the formation of the processes of scientometric and expert analysis, agree on the stages and timing of the evaluation," said Elena Aksenova, head of the expert-analytical department of FANO Russia.
The event will be attended by representatives of more than a hundred scientific institutions of Russia.
It is expected that a resolution will be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: the city of Moscow, Solyanka street, house 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists at the University of California, Santa Cruz studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneities in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow you to search among the stars for relatives, that is, those that emerged from the same cluster.
The results of their research were published in the journal Nature, and can be read briefly on the university’s website.
The reason for the same chemical composition of nearby stars is turbulent mixing in the clouds of gas preceding the formation of stars.
Even if the born star then leaves the star cluster, by its chemical composition it is possible to determine the place of its birth and the region of formation of the related stars.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to the appearance of differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
The results of the simulations carried out by astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, scientists used a supercomputer to model two streams of interstellar gas that together formed the cloud.
This object for several million years under the action of its own gravity is transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
The scientists added paint tags to the initial gas streams and found that rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud achieves a high degree of chemical homogeneity.
According to astrophysicists, their study proves that it is possible to search for stars-relatives by chemical composition, as well as determine possible regions of formation of such objects.
Carrata police arrest 20-year-old man after high-speed motorcycle chase

Lavrov: Russia will not “knock on door” in connection with new sanctions and will not leave the WTO
Russia will not “knock on the door” in connection with the new sanctions.
This was stated today by the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergey Lavrov, speaking to students and teachers of MGIMO.
Regarding our response to the new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even think, fantasize, because everything must be specifically calculated,” he said.
And when we understand what the European and American partners will like this time, then we will make decisions on how to respond to it.
This will not be related to knocking on the door, some insults, misunderstood, - the Minister stressed.
We will, first of all, move away from our interests, interests to protect our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the actions of partners in terms of their adequacy, contractual capacity and reliability.
According to the steps that are taken in the field of sanctions, it is possible to judge very well what the partners are pursuing, - the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry continued.
If they say in full voice that "they sanctions will also be painful for us, but we are forced to go for it to punish Russia", - this is probably not very adequate.
As for the WTO withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, no.
We, on the other hand, want to learn more about WTO instruments, including when it comes to trade disputes,” Lavrov said.
We have already used this toolkit to overcome what we believe is the EU’s discriminatory anti-dumping policy.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and at the same time anti-dumping measures are applied against the sectors of the economy of the Russian Federation.
“We are ready to use WTO mechanisms in order to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the third energy package in retrospect,” Lavrov said.
How to properly use cheese in garden design?
Irina Okuneva answers the following questions:
Since the cheese after discoloration loses its main appeal, it is desirable to plant it together with other shrubs.
It blends well with many cultures.
And next to the cheese can and should be planted both plants, decorative in other terms, and flowering at the same time with it.
Another plus of the mermaid is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a log tree of different height, an improved bush, a bush with a wide base and even a resemblance to a garden bonsai - a tree with a strangely curved stem.
Just choose the shape that best suits the design of your garden.
In Karelia for the sale of fake money sentenced a resident of the Leningrad region
According to the Republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in criminal fishing in Olonets and Segezhsky districts.
In addition to Karelia, he has committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already managed to inherit in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonets district court.
And to end the investigation of crimes committed in our republic, he was transferred to Segezh.
The investigation has proven the guilt of several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money, relating to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the criminal case materials with the indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, 29 August, the court decided to replace the term of imprisonment by four years with a stay in a general regime colony.
The sentence did not come into force legally.
Recall that last week, two more sellers of fake money, which were paid by them in Petrozavodsk stores, were convicted.
Citizens of Azerbaijan came to Karelia also from St. Petersburg.
One of them is deprived of liberty for five years, the other for four.
Each is given a fine of 500,000 rubles.
The sentence has not yet entered into force.
In Arkhangelsk celebrated the 73rd anniversary of the arrival of the first convoy "Dervish"
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervish supplied the Soviet Union with military aid from the United States and the United Kingdom.
In Arkhangelsk, a memorial rally was held at the cornerstone of the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the Sedova embankment in Solombal.
The event brought together representatives of Arkhangelsk veteran organizations, children from the cadet class.
For the first time we met twenty-three years ago, when the foundation stone was laid.
But at the same time, today’s event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance for those who have not been returned by the sea,” said Boris Karpov, Chairman of the Council of Veterans of the Northern Sea Shipping.
Then at the event, the city brass band performed, and the students of cadet classes gave the veterans flowers and marched with the flags of Russia and the Victory flag.
The meeting ended with the laying of flowers on the foundation stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English ships and one Dutch transport loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of shaped boots, lead, wool, and many other equipment and equipment).
In addition, on board the ships were military equipment and weapons - 3,800 deep-sea bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen "Harriken" fighters, in disassembled condition.
At the same time, the escort of the convoy consisted of 16 ships of the British Navy, among which were two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of ships was not detected by the enemy and safely reached the destination - Arkhangelsk.
Out of a total of 848 ships involved in vital caravan operations, 126 transport vessels and about 50 warships were killed.

Recalling the very American ideal that labour rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill that protects trade union organization as a civil right.
“Where there are unions, there are middle-class jobs,” says Allison, a Minnesota Democrat who is a co-chair of the Progressive Faction Congress.
That's why I'm proud to introduce the Workers' Rights Act, along with the Civil Rights Movement symbol John Lewis.
This innovative bill will give workers the same legal opportunity to discriminate against trade union organizations as it does with other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of trade union opponents.
The amendment of the Law on the Regulation of Labour Relations in such a way as to allow workers who face discrimination for participating in trade unions to seek justice in civil courts - and to receive compensation for damages and fines - is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is certainly not a radical initiative – at least by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Allison, Lewis, and co-authors of the bill are proposing is to recall a very American thought.
Despite the attacks that unions have been subjected to in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country – Americans once supported countries around the world in accepting, expanding and respecting labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country at the same time defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his aides helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hideki Tojo was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their unions play a role in the formation of a new Japan, they included a text that explicitly recognized that “the right of workers to an organization, and to negotiations, and to collective action is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his aides helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognising that workers would need to be organized and heard in the new state, the Germans included an article that openly stated: “The right to form associations to protect and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or sphere of activity.
Agreements that restrict or seek to infringe this right will not have legal force; measures aimed at these purposes will be found to be unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which would be adopted by the United Nations as a world agreement in 1948, Roosevelt and the compilers included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and defend themselves”.
For generations, Americans have taken for granted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When that country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, the Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions — and to have this union participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies — should be protected.
Now that these rights are under attack in America, it is wise indeed to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As St. Martin Luther King Jr. said fifty years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement did not undermine the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the living standards of millions, the trade unions have miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers how it should be for us.
The official recognition of labour rights as human rights – and the extension of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination against trade unions – has long been a thing of the past.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are reviving the ideals that have historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
A judge is temporarily blocking a law that could shut down all abortion clinics in Louisiana.
In the United States, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the introduction of Louisiana law, which his supporters say will likely shut down all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under this measure, which was signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Ginadel in June and was due to take effect on September 1, doctors who perform abortions would be required to have the authority to admit patients to hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that for the moment doctors can continue to perform legal abortions, continuing to seek such powers.
“The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing to exercise their powers,” Judge John DeGrevells wrote in his ruling.
The hearing will take place during the month in which the judge will make a more permanent decision under this law.
Defenders of the right to abortion welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital powers.
“Today’s decision ensures that Louisiana women will be protected from an insidious law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” Nancy Nortap, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, said in a statement.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision applies to doctors from two clinics who did not act as plaintiffs in the case, and also applied for admissions.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, and courts have recently recognized such measures as unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would have closed most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say that laws on admissions impose restrictions on doctors that are not medically necessary.
Opponents of abortion object that such measures are aimed at protecting women's health, although some also noted their positive effect in the closure of clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has the authority to be admitted to the hospital, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing this procedure, this doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop performing this procedure, the group said.
Criticizing the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while their applications for admissions await a decision.
What will lead to the introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of goods in the assortment of trade networks should be Russian-made, believes the deputy of the State Duma from the Just Russia faction Oleg Nilov.
The parliament has prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writes the newspaper "Izvestia".
The document will be further detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
This applies to goods that are not produced in Russia. <0x3C>...> According to the other groups of products that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic manufacturers, "- Nilov told the publication.
Together with the amendments to the article "On the basis of state regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation", the bill provides for the introduction of amendments to the Tax Code, which establish a reduced rate of VAT of 10% when selling products produced in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in trade networks is part of a package of incentive measures for Russian manufacturers.
On the shelves will appear several times more domestic goods.
However, the initiative can have both a positive and a negative effect, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the company "Taxovyk", a member of the independent expert center "Public Duma" Sergey Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.
In addition, there will be agricultural producers, farmers, small shops.
They will be able to sell more, which means profits will grow.
In addition, they will have the right to dictate to retailers their terms and prices, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian producers will be able to increase the volume of their activities and sales, which will lead to the payment of higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will begin to expand, some will develop faster, will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia’s dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, but not immediately,” the expert notes.
Previously, Russian enterprises often could not break into the shelves of local stores due to high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now, after the imposition of the embargo, this niche has been freed and can be breathed with relief.
But do not forget that after all the necessary agreements and sanitary checks on the Russian market will receive food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia.
In other words, now is the “moment of calm” when the former players have already left, and the new ones have not yet come.
Almost a month later, we can talk about the increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as the increase in prices for finished products," said AiF.ru, the first Vice-President of the All-Russian public organization "Russian Club of Financial Directors", CEO Tamara Kasiyanova.
Clearly, the idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food products in each category will allow to consolidate the sector for local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, and not with goods that are cheaper because of subsidies from another state.
In other words, the struggle for the buyer will be between companies working under the same laws of the industry.
On the other hand, says Kasyanov, Russian manufacturers are able to meet 50% of domestic needs of compatriots far from all articles.
And in this situation, the trade networks will have to "reach" the share of Russian goods to half the range.
In this regard, there are growing fears that poor quality goods will enter the countertops.
It is possible that foreign products with broken labels will be delivered under the guise of manufactured in Russia,” the expert adds.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that with such a schedule, foreign suppliers themselves will suffer, as the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods can also affect consumers.
The fact is that some products of Russian production may be inferior in quality to imported analogues, while stores will be able to propel prices for the latter as a scarce commodity.
The idea of import substitution, forgotten in the early 2000s, was talked about again by economists in February of this year due to the continuous devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the background of difficult relations with the West, the question of the refusal of imported products becomes even more relevant.
The law is designed to oblige retailers in the formation of orders to consider domestic manufacturers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the way of import substitution, and the production planning system for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter period of time,” says Deputy Oleg Nilov.
A particularly effective quota mechanism would be for those agricultural sectors where the potential is particularly high, for example in the dairy sector, where the share of imports was 25 per cent.
Our farmers are really able to fully cover the shelves of Russian stores.
In addition, a powerful pulse can also be obtained meat production.
As you know, the largest share of imports is kept on beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out that 65-70% still belongs to Russian products,” Kasyanov argues.
Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas on domestic products will facilitate import substitution and can speed up this process.
However, in itself, this initiative will not lead to import substitution, because it requires a set of measures, Litvinenko believes.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be imported from abroad, which means that there will be no full import substitution, but significant steps in this direction will be taken.
In addition, there is little to establish quotas, it is still necessary to establish the production of domestic products in the country in order to meet these quotas.
These quotas are just such guarantees and will provide," the expert states.
Untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video of the memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who procrastinate in rural Australia face a higher risk of death from ovarian cancer than those who live in cities.
Researchers analyzed the disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 percent lived five years after being diagnosed.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Institute for Medical Research said the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 percent higher for those living in regions and remote areas of the state than for those living in urban areas.
NEBEST RESEARCH: New Medications May Slow Lung and Ovarian Cancers
The researchers followed the medical path of women for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman’s age at the time of diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases, and socioeconomic status also affected the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state, the probability of dying during the study was 20 percent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside cities are more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that a misdiagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment are possible factors.
“This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly located in large cities,” she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing the number of outbound services that would allow specialists to treat women closer to home, and support programs for people undergoing treatment far from their home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographic location, the study found that longevity among women with ovarian cancer was rare, stressing the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from the Gold Coast, Elise Nive, was told she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September in the Kuzhenersky district will open the doors of a new FAP
Construction of a medical facility in the village of Toktaibeljak was started in April of this year and was carried out on a model project.
The cost of the works amounted to just over 10 million rubles.
As reported by the management of public relations and information of the Head of Mari El, the financing of the construction of the object was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the built medical and preventive institution is almost 230 square meters.
It will provide medical care to residents of eight settlements: the villages of Toktaibeljak and the villages of Dementievo, Puncheryumal, Tunya, Fomichi, Toraibeljak, Shinur and Chaskayal.
The new post will replace the current FAP, whose building was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new facility will be opening soon.
Who killed a four-month-old son in a drunken state, novocheboxarka will appear in court
A resident of Chuvashi will be on the bench of the defendants for the murder of their own child.
In Cheboksary, a criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, accused of causing death by carelessness, has been completed.
The investigation found that on July 26 this year, the accused, together with her four-month-old son, came to celebrate the birthday of her godfather in Cheboksary.
After a prolonged stasis, the novocheboxarka decided to stay in the guest room and put the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, a blind woman put him next to her on the bed to feed her breast, but soon fell asleep.
During the sleep, the woman fell on her son, as a result of which he died of suffocation.
The criminal case, reports the press service of the SU SCR on Chuvashia, is sent to the court.
Inflation has come out of the holiday.
Will the Russians feel a sharp rise in prices?
As a result of the cross-sanctions of Russia and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not fit into the forecasts of the authorities, VTB Capital analysts are convinced.
According to experts, the postponed consequences of anti-sanctions will lead to inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, writes RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7.5%, next year and then less - 6.5%.
However, according to the newspaper Kommersant, this week the MER is expected to make “small but fundamental” adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency can lower the inflation estimate for 2015, which will eliminate the expected net zero growth in the population's income.
The forecast assumed that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation are valid for a year - until August 2015.
How could such a high inflation be expected in such a situation?
The current situation implies a one-time shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change," a source in the Ministry of Finance said.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the government’s financial and economic bloc regarding inflation and forecast a price increase of 8% in 2014.
The main effect of the food bans will come along with the possible introduction of sales tax (SST) in the regions of the Russian Federation in 2015, experts are convinced.
Inflation will peak at 9% in February, after which the annual rate of price growth will go down, experts believe.
By the way, last week Rosstat summed up the first inflation results after the Russian Federation introduced “careful sanctions”.
AiF.ru surveyed the experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the analytical department of AForex FC:
Price increases are already observed in the main segments of goods.
Moreover, when socially significant products began to be valued, the government was forced to launch measures of systematic monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unjustified price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators so that the authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason initiates the price hike.
The key factors in the growth of the consumer price index continue to be the colossal rate of capital outflow, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian mega-regulator, internal conversion due to population flight into foreign currency, as well as the embargo on the import of food products from the countries that joined the anti-Russian movement.
If inflationary pressure remained under control, the basket value of the minimum set of products would not jump by 12% in a single quarter.
The ban on the import of food products provoked a shock of supply in the domestic market and led to a perfectly logical increase in the final value.
Since at the current stage we are not able to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, as well as increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market through domestic production, retaliatory sanctions will continue to carry the risks of growth of the inflationary component.
If we add to this the fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as the deteriorating prospects for economic growth, by the end of this year inflation may well exceed 8%.
Alexander Razuvayev, director of the analytical department "Alpari"
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, at zero it was also above the current level, the other thing is that it was then compensated by rapid economic growth.
I think at the end of the year inflation will be 8-8.5%.
Plato Maguta, the asset manager of the Maguta Foundation
The external factor associated with sanctions against Russia is still successfully contained, but if there is a further increase in pressure, primarily on the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually traditionally manifested in the purchase of cash in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulation.
But the rise in prices traditionally begins after the summer solstice and may become more noticeable this fall.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia of 7.5% is likely to stand, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Gardening centers are saddened by the decrease in the number of homeowners
Such a fall, due to an exceptional reduction in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could lead to horticultural centers starting to lose tens of millions of pounds a year as today’s young consumers reach “the primary age of horticulture,” according to an HTA study reported by the Financial Times.
According to this report, homeowners spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that homeowners spend on gardening.
It mentions an increase in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popularity of asphalting yards in front of a home for parking and a reduction in the size of the garden as other factors threatening the industry, whose annual sales are estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, the UK’s lowest rate of spending on gardening goods is on household goods.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society reported that renting housing and the lack of space for the garden did not mean that people could not grow plants.
Guy Barter, Chief Gardening Advisor at RHS, said: “Planting in containers, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move.”
The HTA report defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of retail trade in horticultural goods as a result of an increase in the number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria conducted a mass cleaning in the fund "Agriculture"
Three of the four heads of the Agricultural Fund were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Agricultural Fund were replaced as early as Friday.
Officially, the Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria has only announced the removal from the post of Executive Director Atanas Dobrev.
His place was taken by Lozana Vasileva.
It turned out that on Friday, two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were quietly replaced.
Deputy Executive Director Tatiana Angelova, who was previously in charge of state aid and the SAPARD program, has been released, BGNES reports with reference to the newspaper “Trud”.
I did not attend the board of directors of the fund because by law we are not members of the management, but I was later informed that I was released.
I can’t say why my dismissal is not reported on the fund’s website.
I'm on vacation.
I hope to learn more on Monday,” she told Angelova.
It will be replaced by Ivanka Bagdatova, who until now was the head of “Investment lending” in the central fund in “Agriculture” in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Prior to that, he was responsible for direct subsidies for fields paid by the EU.
In his place will be appointed Zhyvko Zhyvkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the fund "Agriculture" in the city of Veliko-Tyrnov until January 2014.
Only the deputy head of the fund Atija Aliyeva-Veli retained her post.
She is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey summons U.S. diplomat in connection with espionage report
Turkey’s Foreign Ministry has summoned the country’s highest-ranking U.S. diplomat for clarification on a report on U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. attorney general and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the Internet magazine The Intercept reported that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has downplayed the importance of this message, saying that all leading countries are spying on each other.
Earlier reported information that Germany’s main intelligence agency also made Ankara an object of intelligence has provoked a more angry response from the Turkish government.
The biggest Chinese companies have joined forces against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China’s largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and internet giants Tencent Holdings (social networks, messengers, etc.) and Baidu (China’s largest search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online shopping market with Alibaba.
However, catching up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left behind even its American rivals – eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Union of the largest
The companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of it will belong to Wanda and 15% to each of the Internet companies, according to the Wanda Group.
Registration of the company is planned in Hong Kong.
The joint venture will combine Baidu’s search services with the popular social platform WeChat (China’s largest social network, with around 438 million users), Tencent, and Wanda’s infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 luxury hotels, Wanda Group operates at least 49 commercial real estate properties across China and 40 shopping malls.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan (more than $8 billion) in the construction of a movie studio and theme park in Qingdao (a city in eastern China on the Yellow Sea coast).
It is expected that the project will attract more than 1 million visitors annually and bring a profit of $ 960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American network of cinemas AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the largest operator of cinemas in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all its shopping centers, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, which will be developed by Alibaba’s newly-created competitor.
According to Dong Tse, who will head the new company, thanks to the merger Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new platform is set to become the world’s largest online-to-offline platform, Dong Tse said.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract buyers online so that they come to the usual offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O is coupon sales services like Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
“O2O is the biggest pie in online commerce,” said Wanda Wang Jianlin (Bloomberg).
"The current O2O site in China does not exist, and in this situation, the chances are approximately equal for everyone," he said.
China’s e-commerce market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates its volume will more than triple by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese Internet users has grown to 632 million, according to Bloomberg data official statistics: this is more than the population of any country in the world, except India.
And according to forecasts, by 2015, this number can grow to 850 million people.
Union of the Richest
Tencent CEO Ma Huathen was China’s richest man until recently, however, according to Bloomberg’s millionaire index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already surpassed him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma’s fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion is his share in Alibaba.
Baidu leader Robin Lee is now ranked third among China’s richest people, while Wanda’s Wang Jianglin is fourth in the ranking.
“It’s very interesting to watch this battle: the three richest people join forces to challenge the even richer,” said Bloomberg, director of China’s e-commerce research center in Hangzhou, China.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to seriously compete with Alibaba immediately after its creation: “Rome can’t be built in a day.”
The fact that Alibaba is not so easy to compete not only with new companies, but also well-deserved leaders of the world Internet trade, indicates a report published the day before on the financial indicators of Alibaba for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as something between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba's net profit for the period is almost twice the same as its competitors' combined profit - it grew almost three times year-on-year to $1.99 billion.
“Alibaba still has tremendous potential for generating money, largely through its mobile apps,” said a report by an analyst at Hong Kong’s Arete Research Service.
According to Alibaba’s updated prospectus on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s website, the number of active mobile users of the company’s services in July was 188 million, significantly exceeding the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions in the past quarter were on mobile devices.
Alibaba will name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) could take place as early as September 16.
The company’s road show, which precedes this event, will start on September 3.
Alibaba’s IPO is expected to become a record in NYSE history and allow the company to attract around $20 billion.
So far, the record for the amount of funds raised on U.S. exchanges belonged to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 carried out the primary placement of its shares, earning $17.9 billion.
At least half of the food products in the trade networks should be Russian-made, say deputies of the State Duma.
They drafted a bill on the subject.
We are talking about amendments to Article 8 of the Federal Law “On the Fundamentals of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation” and to the Tax Code.
The purpose of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
An important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of the products of domestic production in stores should be for each type of goods.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, vegetables and fruits in the winter, so they will be given a "discount" to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which sets a reduced VAT rate of 10% on the sale of all food products, the country of origin of which is Russia, reports the newspaper "Izvestia".
On August 27, the lower house of the parliament was introduced a bill on amendments to the law "On retail markets", which proposes to revive in Russia farmers' markets, in which small producers will be able to sell their products.
Magaluf Police Chief Accused of Corruption <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvi to the office of the public prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The chief of police of Calvia on the resort island of Mallorca was arrested on charges of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the scandalous center of unbridled drinking Magaluf.
Chief Inspector Jose Antonio Navarro has been detained on corruption charges brought against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, a street that houses most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs.
According to the daily online edition of Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs presented evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvi to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca against corruption on Friday.
Two more local police officers have been arrested by the National Guard of Spain in connection with corruption charges and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that disgruntled nightclub owners say that protectionism by the authorities seriously affects the state of their business.
“It’s not about making money anymore, it’s about surviving,” one businessman told the court.
Our sources of existence cannot be jeopardized.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf hit the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showed an 18-year-old British holidaymaker making a blowjob to 24 men during a run in bars.
The island's authorities have since tried to stop the hooliganism in a sleepless state among holidaymakers in Magaluf, minimizing the number of scandalously known alcohol runs in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the incident took place, was forced to close for a year, while the Playhouse and the organizers of the Carnage Bar Race together were fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort of Magaluf, mainly popular with young British holidaymakers, has also been the site of numerous accidents in a state of alcoholic intoxication associated with a crazy fun known as "balcony" when people jump from one balcony to another or from a balcony to a hotel balcony.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and windy conditions, which affected flights at Adelaide Airport
WEATHER prepared a cold surprise in the south of South Australia, bringing torrential rains and strong winds that affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city at 9 p.m., followed by 6.6 mm, which fell on Sunday night.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short showers with gusty winds, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and poured almost 4mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter released an early portion of spring last week, the temperature dropped again on Monday to a maximum of just 15.8C in the city.
Harsh conditions are believed to have been one of the reasons for the delay of the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land on schedule immediately after 7:30 p.m., but fell into the wind shift zone - a sudden change in speed or wind direction at a short distance - and was forced to gain altitude.
Wind gusts reached 50 km/h on land at Adelaide Airport at this time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to gain altitude during the second landing, and the plane eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay of this flight caused the subsequent delay of several other flights, including Emirates flight from Dubai and Qantas flight from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is forecasted in Adelaide on Tuesday with a probability of one or two showers.
Calculation of the estimate of construction sites in Russia will be carried out in a new way
The issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as the problem of connection to networks Federal Antimonopoly Service takes special control.
An expert council for the development of competition in the construction sector has been established at FAS.
At his meeting, the head of the management of control of residential, construction and natural resources FAS Vadim Solovyev said that "Today's calculation of the estimate of construction facilities is absolutely incomprehensible."
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to an unreasonable construction price, the FAS believes.
And offer the cost of construction of state-owned facilities at the design stage to determine based on market prices of constructive solutions instead of the currently applied estimated norms and unit prices for technological operations.
These proposals are included in the "road map" and are now under consideration in the ministry.
“The replacement of traditional estimated documentation in construction for the calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,” explained Vadim Soloviev.
After all, now every bolt and nut is calculated in the estimate, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation unscrupulous construction companies can bury "whole tractors".
In the ministry with the FAS agree.
"The first developments on the transition to the calculation of the cost on the constructive elements are already there: methods for calculating the prices on the constructive solutions, compiling estimates on these indicators have been developed," said Elena Zhukova, head of the Department of Urban Planning and Architecture of the Ministry of Construction.
As a pilot, the field of road construction was chosen.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
Anatoly Demyanko, head of construction company Profi-Invest, told RGB, the estimated standards have long been outdated, but another mechanism for business has not yet been proposed.
“As for the proposed calculations on the structural elements, it is difficult to implement in practice, since completely different technologies are often used in the construction of buildings,” he believes.
It is no secret that the construction market is developing largely thanks to the state order.
According to the Chairman of the Board of the State Enterprise "Expert Community of State Order Professionals" Ekaterina Lezina, today the state is the most solvent customer.
Deputy Director for Engineering of Rosatom’s Sectoral Center of Capital Construction Vladimir Malakhov noted that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to the portfolio of contracts, and companies that have monopoly competencies and do not allow competitors in this field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is protected as much as possible from someone’s controlling influence.
The expert council was asked to form a state order system in such a way that the same contractor is not entitled to receive more than one contract in the amount of more than 1 billion rubles or several contracts in the amount of more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry believes that this approach should be evaluated in terms of the impact on business, as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case it will be necessary to assign the customer with the functions of a general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the number of employees of the customer and budget costs for its maintenance.
At the same time, the customer’s specialists will have to have knowledge to assess the quality of the work performed by the contracting organizations, as well as their safety.
Often with such a breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the object as a whole.
In addition, this approach can lead to the outflow of highly qualified public procurement participants due to the lack of interest in receiving a government order for the partial amount of work and a small amount of the contract.
Deputy heads of the expert-consultation center of the Procurement Institute Alexander Evstashenkov believes that now the state order procedure has turned into a business game for the attention of the contractor.
And he gave this example: "the participant when filling in the application must indicate "specific indicators" without specifying the words: "or equivalent", "should not be", "from", "more", "less", "similar", "or", "type", "not lower", "lower", "above", "may", "may", "may", "may" and "may"
Thus, customers often abuse their right to set requirements for the content of the application submitted by contracting entities.
Another problem 44-FZ, according to Evstashenkov, was the need to evaluate the quality of work through the “paper” offer of the participant at the application stage.
Considering the application of the participant, it is really possible to assess only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of the work, which has not yet begun to be carried out, - the expert believes.
The quality of the work can only be assessed when it is received.
The expert council was also asked to move the marginal income from the top to the bottom echelon in order to eliminate intermediate contractors.
Chairman of the expert council, Secretary of State, Deputy Head of FAS Andrei Tsarikovsky believes that this should not be done, since the contractor must be responsible for the order.
Otherwise, it will turn out, as in the famous reprise of Arkady Raikin "Atelier": "Is there a claim to the buttons?".
Israeli Children Return to School After the Gaza War
Thousands of Israeli children in territories near the Gaza Strip went back to school on Monday after spending a summer in bomb shelters when rockets and rain-throwing mines fell on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed as riots raged.
The beginning of schooling brought a sense of joy and excitement to the missile-stricken settlements of southern Israel, but traces of fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the Pashos kindergarten, which was hit by the rocket, removed traces of fragments from the walls and playgrounds before the arrival of the students.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re looking forward to the future,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibutza Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a measured life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was "a little weird" to start going to school again.
“It was a difficult time and we didn’t leave our homes at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz, which is located near the border with Gaza, to express his support.
Before the cease-fire agreement ended the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad did not take to the streets or leave their homes, leaving for safer areas further away from the Gaza Strip to escape rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the border with Gaza where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine, doubt that they should go back.
The Ministry of Education reported that about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza that was heavily ravaged by Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study diligently and said, “We will do our best to give you knowledge and ensure your safety.”
Israel and Hamas agreed to an indefinite truce on Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to the fighting, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas's demand to lift the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and to open airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians died in the war, including three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the United Nations.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of those killed were militants; however, it has not provided substantial evidence to support this claim.
66 soldiers and six civilians, including one Thai worker, were killed by the Israeli side.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 rockets and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of the Israeli attacks, thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip have been damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 250,000 people have found refuge in more than 100 schools that have been converted into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, officials in charge of education postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope the school will open soon so that we can complete our education as children of the world and as Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of Gaza’s schools.
According to the popular criterion, the price of real estate showed the largest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic home price index in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, RP Data reported on Monday.
This increase led to a combined increase of 4.2 per cent for June, July and August, the largest increase for the winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth was 10.9 percent, more than double the 12-month growth by August 2013, but the increase was not evenly spread across the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lowless said Sydney and Melbourne are leading a two-tier market.
Figures from RP Data show that Sydney’s housing prices have risen by 16.1 percent in the past year, while Melbourne’s has risen by 11.7 percent.
The next most powerful markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five to six percent.
At the other end of the scale was Canberra, which underwent government spending cuts, where prices rose by only 1.4 percent a year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of real estate items on sale over the next few months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current conditions with a low interest rate, it is likely that the cost of housing will continue to rise over the next three months,” he said.
How people live in the oldest house of Ufa
In the former house of goldsmiths and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (former Bolshaya Kazanskaya) 18 apartments.
The house of the XVIII century from the time of construction has practically not changed, if not to take into account old age.
Foreigners come here as a tour, and the residents suffer more than they are happy, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Ufa house, the walls of which are remembered by the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians indicate two dates - 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, it turns out that the building is less than 300 years old.
The old courtyard, always open door, a squeaky staircase.
The doors to the apartments are located close to each other, the walls are cracked, and in the illuminations from the shelled plaster in places you can see the street.
I think it's all in the right word.
And the locals say, "You don't think that's the case."
Living in a wooden house of the XVIII century is very difficult, - says Tatiana Lukyanova, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is in state custody, but the money for its contents has not been allocated for decades, and we feel like museum exhibits, about which the authorities have simply forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still poorly maintained, but the foundation has rotted away.
Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and wash once a week in a public bath.
How can we be happy in such conditions?
The road passes right under the windows, even there is no pedestrian zone.
Tatiana pulls the curtain off.
Now you can see what was only heard before: under the windows there is a stream of cars.
You see, the windows are constantly crumbling, we can't open the windows, and we're used to the noise.
People get used to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to the husband, his hands are golden.
Moreover, we have two rooms, we live in three with a son.
And in other families the conditions are much worse, on the second floor in general ceilings a little more than one and a half meters high.
To contrast Tatiana offers to visit the neighbor from apartment No. 6 Lyudmila Starostina.
A pleasant hospitable woman from the threshold offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile tells:
We have a one-room apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, and we live: we are husband and daughter and granddaughter.
I've been here since I was born, there's never been another living space, - Lyudmila surrounds the room with her eyes: mezzanines, two sofas with the letter "g"; on one of them is a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very narrow and little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historic".
But from the ceiling regularly flows: the water supply system is not suitable anywhere.
Lyudmila speaks of her apartment as ordinary and surprising at the same time as an Italian woman whose house stands on Roman ruins.
That is, it boils down to one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The pipeline was completed about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then they made us a small kitchen in the corner and a toilet from the former culan.
We live right where Demidov lived with his family, on the second floor lived servants.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
At the Ufa Real Estate Center, privatization is of no importance.
Still, we will only get a one-room apartment, we can not claim for more.
Four months ago, we were promised resettlement, but the promise was not fulfilled.
I'm not used to complaining, and I won't.
In this apartment (room!) lived a whole dynasty: my grandmother with her grandfather, mother with her father, me with my husband and my daughter with her granddaughter.
Everything happened during that time.
For example, healthy rats ran around the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the wing, they are a meter thick!
It is said that the solution was mixed on eggs, so it lasts for so long.
The house was built thoroughly, thank you Demidov!
Maybe that's why he didn't kill anyone with a collapsed ceiling or his own.
Only the building is still slowly dying before our eyes: the boards and logs of the house rot, the floors have repeatedly collapsed, we poured cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes to the ground, as in a well.
It is said that under our room there is a secret lass and a walk to the White River, which was specially made by the old Believers who once lived here, so that it could be sheltered from danger, in case of danger.
They were persecuted.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how some historian came to them, begged to let him start in the apartment of the excavation.
And then he convinced them to give them a living space in exchange for his granddaughter on the avenue of October.
Lyudmila the historian denied:
Where are the four of us at?
And here there is a tiny hope that they will give housing more spacious.
If we'd agreed to an exchange, we wouldn't have won anything.
However, the family of the Elders did not win anything.
Lyudmila's biggest dream was to move them, and her daughter with a 16-year-old granddaughter was given a separate room.
That is, two families have allocated a two-room apartment instead of the most majestic ruins, in which two generations live now.
Cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakov from apartments No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two narrow rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, lives her large family.
There are seven of us, two children.
You can see for yourself the conditions.
The plaster falls off pieces, as well as window frames, in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms through holes.
The water in the tap is cold all year round.
Walking around the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can be sure that the most fortunate are the spouses of Lavrentiev from apartment No. 4.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You're right, there's plenty of room!
The room is 75 square meters, three people are prescribed.
We live in exactly those rooms where Suvorov, according to legend, stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentiev.
Ceilings are high, spacious.
One bad thing - everything around cracks on the seams, collapses, collapses.
The neighbors must have already told me!
Most of the torture we have with the floors: the wooden boards rotted, the ground literally went from under the feet.
I put the props, the wedges; there's nothing in the room yet, and in the other room we walk like swinging on swings, so much so.
About the house of the merchant Yevdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitrievich can tell better than any tour guide.
He treats the gold industry as his own, speaks of it with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was extraordinary: the owner of the Kagin and Uzyan factories built houses, cast guns and bells, kept Ural mines.
The heirs of commercial real estate are proud of their ancestors, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child, in the 40s of the XX century, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then there were wooden rooms for carriages, stables and guard booths, which were subsequently demolished.
In 1968, they wanted to remove our house, but something prevented it.
The story repeated in 2014: again lured by new housing.
We, as a team, collected all the documents, ran around the necessary instances, and suddenly learned that the move to the apartments is postponed to 2015 or 2016.
We don't believe in all of this anymore...
Two years ago, Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The residents did not accept.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a joke, issued a paper without a signature and print: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of residents."
I even got the feeling that our house has not been in the city plan for a long time, because at first it was number 57, then it became 57 A, and now 57/1.
It's like it was taken down in the '70s.
"Russian Planet" appealed to the leading sector of information and analytical work of Ufa land resources management Vladimir Barabash.
The house on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 is included in the program of resettlement of old housing.
I cannot be held responsible for the actions of the officials of the 70s, only I know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all the old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, representing architectural value - is successfully implemented.
Residents are expected to move to new apartments in the near future.
According to Barabash, the restoration of the House of Demidov will be carried out by Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of the buildings in Venice.
There is now an architectural biennale in Italy, and the Old Ufa project is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 all the former Old Kazan Street will be restored, - says the official.
The houses will acquire the proper appearance, corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
Demidov’s house is likely to become a museum open to all.
In addition, at the government level, it was decided to make the street a pedestrian on weekends.
On weekdays, unfortunately, it will not work, too much load of roads in the city.
To resettle people from the future museum Vladimir Barabash promises in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from another era.
In Primorye, a forest fire started because of the storm
The dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire on the territory of Hunting area forestry in the Fire District of the Primorsky Territory.
At the site of the fire, a grouping of forces and means is being built up.
According to the leadership of the KGSBU "Primorskaya Air Base", the conditions created at the site of the fire require the involvement of aviation forces.
Vasily Medvedev, deputy head of the airbase:
The fire, which occurred in a hard-to-reach area, was discovered by an observer pilot aboard an An-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
The wood remains are burning on the old burner.
The strong dampness of the area and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the lack of suitable landing pad-fire sites create significant difficulties in extinguishing.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
The delivery of forces at the disposal of the air base by Mi-2 helicopter and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was detected, four paratroopers were promptly deployed to the place of slaughter.
The main task of specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare a site for the delivery of additional forces and fire extinguishers.
In the lunch area in the area of the village Hunting helicopter additionally delivered 3 fire fighters.
As soon as the site for the landing of the helicopter in the area of the fire is ready, specialists will be transferred to the place of slaughter, according to the website of the administration of the Primorsky Territory.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
I never said, "I love you."
Henry was one of seven children born to a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Midlands, in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked at the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses a comedy, "Rare Records of Rudy", which is based in part on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of broadcasts on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, and the melodies are lively.
However, Henry had to go through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death, there was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often reflects on his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You've never seen his face, you've only heard his voice: "Stop making noise.
Stay away from your sister.
Move! Move!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were adults when I was a kid, would go to a pub with him and talk about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket kick.
I've never talked to him like that.
He was such an insatiable guy in the corner who read the paper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than in his father’s day, he was able to look at what his life must have been like.
It's a little better out there now, but it's dark, smoky, underground labyrinths with bursts of fire and smoke and piles of soot.
My dad got in the bath and just lay there, and you heard him slowly start singing about himself because he wanted to wash himself off from the foundry.
When I got there, I realized that he had been doing it for years and years to earn us a living, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry came out of childhood devoid of parental love.
My father never hugged, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom got sick at the very end of her life did we begin to say, “I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don French, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop saying "I love you"?
Just stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22!
With Don French.
Why don't I be friends with her?
She's a great mom.
They are still great friends with French, whom he was married to for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I be friends with Don?
She's a great mom.
Henry’s mother had diabetes.
He was one of those who killed her.
So when I was very, very well and I had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You need to take radical measures.
Then I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And that's boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry’s career trajectory change is reflected, perhaps, in his noble, short-haired beard.
Since he received critical acclaim for his Othello, he has fully immersed himself in the theatre.
It was followed by "The Comedy of Errors" and then "The Fences" by August Wilson.
This work is different from sitcoms and comedies, which were an integral attribute of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed him parodying on stage and wrote about him in New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For quite a long time I was the only black parody/comic on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow up in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in "The New Faces" in 1975
Since his manager was entitled to the “Black and White Menstrual Show,” a light entertainment program in which people “blackened their faces,” Henry discovered that he had been performing in it for five years.
My family didn’t like it very much.
I kind of wish it never happened to me, but I don't regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, condemnable position, I worked in large venues and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was "a prize-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years" was "a grotesque parody of black people."
Representing characters who both mocked and sang about black culture in the UK, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the 1980s.
The first season of "The Lenny Henry Show" aired in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, chef Gareth Blacklock of the comedy series "Chef!".
Commercials, documentaries, TV series, and film roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought, “What are you going to do next, Len, because it’s a little bit like you’re taking your time or you’re taking your time slowly?”
Then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 called "What's good in...?"
The first was about Shakespeare.
I had a real allergy to Shakespeare.
I can’t say that I was taught that at school, and I thought it was largely the prerogative of white middle-class people with pantyhose and cabbage at the bottom of the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You've got to try.
Don't argue until you know what you're talking about.
Say some of these words out loud, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines from the last Othello monologue for a documentary, and he was hooked.
I had a feeling I could do it.
It's like my head's been straightened.
"That's what it is, it's a serious matter, take it seriously, study your text, do a little research.
So, the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this piece months and months before we put it on.
And she was successful.
It seemed that they were waiting for the disaster, and it did not happen.
Soon we started "The Comedy of Errors".
Suddenly I'm in the National Theater, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
There was a technical problem, and Henry instinctively felt that it was his job to entertain the public.
“A quiet voice inside me said, ‘You’re going to have to work for 10 minutes while they do the computer.’”
Instead, the assistant director announced that the show would resume as soon as the issue was resolved.
I left the scene and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
It's not my job.
I can let someone else deal with it.
"You're playing a play, stay in the role."
Henry in The Fences at the Dachess Theatre
It was difficult to learn the text for "Zaborov".
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
She was also well received, so it was like a sign from above showing, "That's what you have to do."
He says it, of course, in a loud voice.
So I'm holding on to it.
I really like it.
I love being in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has the thinking of a comedian - all the way our conversation is interrupted by bursts of his humor, when he begins, then ends parody.
I just decided not to work at the stand because this thing with getting an instant reward from a full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you try to do this all the time, it can get you into a dead end.
I sometimes work at Apollo Live when I want to, but mostly I don’t get as much pleasure as I used to.
I wonder if he'll ever do the stand-up tour again.
The joy of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the road – I don’t think I’ll ever want to give it up.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and there's a great place for that.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya registers civil servants to identify ‘invisible workers’
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all government employees in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the government’s payroll.
Employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, a government statement said.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive salaries after leaving the civil service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has promised to reduce corruption in state structures after coming to power in 2013.
The audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>700,000) a month goes missing due to payments to “invisible workers” and other financial violations.
The government suspects that wages continue to flow into bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves public service, reports BBC reporter Vanyam Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi.
All government employees are required to appear at identification centers within the next two weeks to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, the government said in a statement.
Anyone who does not do this for no good reason will be deleted from the payment statement, it is reported.
"This procedure will significantly contribute to the rationalization of the public service by determining the actual number of civil servants, and will also be used to clean up the payment account at both levels of government - hence putting an end to the problem of 'invisible workers,'" said Ann Weiguru, the secretary of state for civil servants.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested in connection with 'conspiracy' against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government,” local news agencies reported.
Police did not immediately comment on the information.
Among the detainees were 14 high-ranking officers, according to Hurriet Daily News.
Some of them took part in last December ' s anti-corruption activities, which were aimed at screening government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police were arrested on suspicion of setting up an organized criminal group and wiretapping the phone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who at the time was prime minister) defined their actions as part of measures taken against him and others in power by Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (September 1) after summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told expected journalists that not all schools have reopened, but that he will do everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
On the first of September, the ceremony was not held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky above every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge united Ukrainian people’s front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhov, the director of the school in Slavyansk, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally settle here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally marked by the fact that children wear embroidered shirts, hold air balloons in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found such an impressive leader that she needs.
It is followed by a trail of fame from the world of banking, media management and internal circles of the Tory party.
In fact, she has her own experience working in leadership positions.
Her career began at Bain and Co, a global management consulting firm, and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI, and the media world at Pearsons.
She was the head of the Financial Times for seven years, resigning when a senior position at Pearson’s head company was taken by a fellow man who held a lower position.
Its earnings are said to be close to <0xC2><0xA3>1 million.
Its political rating is also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector specialists to Whitehall: she became an adviser to the cabinet.
Her husband is a former Tory adviser.
Earlier in May, I called the work of the chairman of the poisoned bowl.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organisation at the heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The Council has two directions: inside as the top level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but outside as the voice of public concern and concern when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopoly, which needs a complete radical reform.
However, what new president will risk coming, stepping down and destroying the institution as complicated as the Chinese dynasty, if he himself loses his job in this process.
It's a difficult decision.
It would not be so difficult, many people would be happy to see the BBC shrink in size – after reviewing its powers, finances and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, the inevitable negotiations over the cost of the license pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest sum of <0xC2><0xA3>145.50 a year, the British are acquiring a stake in, by far, the largest media enterprise in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it states that the results of its work cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them only 40p per day.
What’s more, it’s clear that Beeb’s popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today versus 31 percent 10 years ago.
BBC viewing and usage patterns have changed: now I get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman - I hope it found him.
Perry, from Texas, says the humiliating tweet was written by someone else.
A tweet from Republican Gov. Rick Perry's confirmed Texas account on Sunday night contained an offensive image of a district attorney from the Democrats, who is at the center of a criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another one from Perry's account, in which the recording was disavowed.
A tweet was just posted from my account, which was written by someone else.
"I don't approve of this tweet, and I deleted it," the post said.
Perry's assistants did not immediately respond to the messages with a request for comment.
Although the recordings were downloaded from Perry's verified account, it was unclear who was actually publishing the tape.
An earlier tweet featured an unflattering caricature of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lemberg, who pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on funding her office when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury hearing in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
“I don’t always drive a car in a state of intoxication, three times the permissible level of alcohol in my blood, but when I do, I accuse Governor Perry of telling me about it.”
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg Office did not conduct an investigation involving a grand jury against Perry.
They were handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry did not plead guilty and called the charges a political ploy.
His powerful legal team has asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, saying the law, which is used to prosecute the governor who has held office for the longest time in Texas’ history, will frustrate what is contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding for $7.5 million from the state's Public Control Division, which is based in Travis County and is prosecuting corruption in the Texas public sector when Lemberg refused to step down.
The veto has triggered an official complaint from a left-leaning public control group.
The ribbon of Perry's verified account is often updated - and sometimes becomes famous.
Coming fifth at a party convention in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he might step out of the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running by the lake and the words, “Here we are, South Carolina!”
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to a "normal state"
One of London’s best-known developers has warned that the property market in south-east England has “returned” to a normal level of activity.
Homes in the capital were subject to buoyant demand and rapidly rising prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble would push the Bank of England to impose restrictions on mortgage lending in June.
Tony Pydgeley, founder and chairman of Berkeley’s elite construction company, said Monday: “Since the start of this financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the peak of 2013,” adding that it provided a “stable working environment.”
The London real estate market was successful during the recession as foreign buyers flocked to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped 18.5 percent in just one year, according to the Land Cadastre, significantly surpassing the average of 6.7 percent for England and Wales as a whole.
Average market prices for private, affordable and student Berkeley schemes rose by about one-fifth last year to reach <0xC2><0xA3>423,000 at the end of April.
However, the pound’s strengthening in recent months has made London’s property less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also halted the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a potential “house tax” ahead of next May’s general election.
London real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, which introduced tougher lending conditions, would also result in a decline in market growth for both real estate buy-sell transactions and prices in the second half of the year.
Fresh data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgage loans in June, suggesting further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has cut its 2015 growth forecast for London property prices to 3 percent based on the fact that the real estate price outlook has already begun to weaken.
Transaction volumes fell by a quarter compared to the previous year in London’s most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
However, demand for homes in the capital turned out to be very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales by more than <0xC2><0xA3>2.2 billion.
Mr. Pigley added: “The demand for the right product with good design and better location remained the same and, reflecting this, sales for the term have remained.”
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes this year by the end of April – almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
Annual pre-tax profit rose by 40 per cent compared to the previous year to <0xC2><0xA3>380 million, income - by 18 per cent to <0xC2><0xA3>1.6 billion.
Speaking Monday before the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pijley said Berkeley’s projected revenue for the year will meet current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, a profit of <0xC2><0xA3>450 million is expected for the whole year before taxes are paid.
The stock price of Berkeley held at <0xC2><0xA3>23.96 in the afternoon on the London Stock Exchange.
Photographs of the naked Jennifer Lawrence published on the Internet by a hacker
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual award ceremony of the American Film Academy.
Photographs of nude actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won an Oscar, were posted online by a hacker who claims to have a "catalogue" of photos of another 100 rising stars.
The Star of the Hunger Games star confirmed that Lawrence's photos were real, and condemned the hacker for "suddenly invading personal space."
There has been an appeal to law enforcement, and they will prosecute anyone who posts stolen photographs of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, which were originally posted on the 4chan photo-sharing site, are believed to have been obtained due to a lack of an Apple iCloud online storage system, and the alleged “catalogue” of the victims of the hack includes the names of dozens of female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary O’Brien, and Mary Elizabeth Wyatt.
It’s unclear how many of these photos are authentic, though Scott Pilgrim’s star against all of them, Winstead, also condemned the hack on Twitter.
“For those of you who look at the photos we took with your husband a few years ago of being alone at home, I hope you’re proud of yourself,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justis of Nicklodeon's series "iCarly" and "Victory Winner" denied that in the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These so-called nude photos of me are FAKE, people.
Let me stop this in the embryo. *Calambur intentional*.
Buzzfeed reported last Sunday that pop star Ariana Grande's rep has denied that the photos on which she is believed to be authentic.
An exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J" that sparked critical acclaim
They dissolved, it is best to say exactly so, they gradually crumbled like a cardboard box, which was left in the rain.
Only occasionally did a woman tell him that he was too serious, hard to communicate with, tense, closed, and perhaps a little irritable.
And then she shook his hand.
He saw the irritability.
He was prickly, like a hedgehog, yes.
The last victim of this barbed wire was a small novel from which he expected more than usual, deliverance from a lonely and boring life and perhaps even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a shimmeringly fragile beauty with freckled hair and a trembling heart from the northern island village, even farther and harsher than Port Roiben.
She came to the south with a companion older than herself, whom Kevern considered her aunt, while the latter inherited a house in a raw, but paradise-like valley under the joyful name "Paradise Valley".
No one lived in the house for several years.
The pipes were leaking, the spiders were sitting motionless in the baths, the slugs left their marks on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden was littered with weeds resembling giant nomadic cabbages.
It was like a cottage from a children's book, both frightening and charming, with a full secret garden.
Author's perspective: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" was included in the 2014 Booker Prize long list.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Eilinn sat, holding hands, in the broken sun loungers among the tall grass, enjoying the unexpectedly warm spring day; they both sat loosely connected to the cheap console, which supplied the country with soothing music and reassuring news, as soon as they heard it.
Your legs are too big.
Due to their aggressiveness, songs of this type were no longer played on the console.
They weren’t banned – nothing was actually banned – they just didn’t lose anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word "archaic".
Public taste did something that would never have been achieved by orders and prescriptions, and just as among books people chose memoirs of rich people who grew up in poverty, cookbooks and romance novels, they chose ballads out of all the music.
Enthusiastic about this day, Kevern began to play the imaginary piano and sing Eileen's big feet with a rude comic voice.
Eileen didn't understand.
“It was a popular song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller,” he told her, machine-wrapped two fingers to her lips.
That's what his father always did to stop the letter "J" before it came off his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was little.
His father played in it with his father, as he told him.
Start with "J" and forget to put two fingers in your mouth, and it'll cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game back then, and it wasn’t very fun now.
He knew what was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen never heard him.
Jazz was also not played, although it was not openly banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There is only one “if” in life.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it would end up.
The same is true of the ostriches.
His unpredictability had an effect on people's nerves.
And jazz was the wit expressed with the help of music.
Although he reached the age of 10, having never heard of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of CDs.
But at least he didn't have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered a time when popular singers were not black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The society was obedient, and this meant that each of its segments agreed with gratitude - gratitude to those who were saved by fate - with the principle of group predisposition.
People of Afro-Caribbean origin by temperament and physical characteristics were well suited to the field of entertainment and sports – and they sang and ran.
The natives of Indostan, as if by nature talented in everything related to electronics, took care that no family was left without a working electronic phone.
What was left of the Polish diaspora was engaged in sanitary work; what was left of the Greek was a plate.
Those who came from the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents did not start to leave the country quickly, when WHAT WAS PRODUCED, WAS NOT PRODUCED, WAS NOT PRODUCED, in fear that they would be accused of arson, in fear, in fact, saying that they were crying out.
To each according to his abilities.
Since she had previously only heard ballads, Eileen had a hard time understanding how offensive words that had just been sung to her by Cavern could have been put on music at all.
Music is an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive," said Cavern.
Except maybe for people who have big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the running garden gave him the illusion of security.
Not a word could penetrate the sound insulation of giant leaves, similar to cabbage leaves.
Eileen still didn't understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn’t want to put two fingers on her lips again.
She thought he was strange anyway.
“He thought it was funny,” he said instead.
She shook her head incredulously, closing Cavern's eyes.
There was nothing in the whole world but the land of her black hair.
There's nothing he'd like to see.
"Well, if you say so," she said, remaining with her opinion.
But that still doesn't explain why you're gonna eat it for me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
The ankles, maybe a little...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too fat?
Do I hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just this stupid song.
He could have said, "I love you," but it was too early for that.
“I like you because you have thick ankles,” he tried to say instead.
I have this perversion.
That didn't sound right.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to make jokes often put him in awkward situations, because, like his father, he lacked that calming charm that could mitigate the cruelty of the jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Cavern, wanted to.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons blushed and got up from the chaise lounge, overturning the console and pouring the wine they were drinking.
Wine from the brook, so the intoxication could not serve as an excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like the palm leaves in a hurricane.
"I like you because you have a stupid head," she said.
Even if you don't like it.
He felt sorry for her both because of the excessive rudeness of his words, and because of the fear that appeared in her eyes when she resisted him.
Did she think he was going to hit her?
She did not talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he did not doubt that in the main features she was similar to the one here.
The same huge ice ocean fell on both of them.
The same deranged men, even more sensitive and capricious after WHAT HAPPENED, IF THE EVENT HAS BEEN PRODUCED, than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered in fury from their pub to the pub, ready to raise their hand at any woman.
Stupid head?
They'd show her a stupid fist if she wasn't careful!
At first they would kiss - the kiss has now become the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the fresh ballads issued by the console - first to kiss her, and then to strike.
Excess clarification, according to Kevern, because the kiss itself was already hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons showed the corps that he needed to leave.
He got out of the chair like an old man.
She herself felt the weight of lead, but the weight of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She watched him go, and from the top of the window she watched him go, and her companion was a man who was carrying the burden.
Adam, leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt an injection of compassion for him and the men in general, although some of them raised their hand at her.
The man who turned away from her, with his back bent, ashamed, beaten, all his ability to fight left him - why did it seem to her that she knew it so well, if she could not remember a single case, until today, when she would have seen such a thing?
Again, one Eileen Solomons looked at her legs.
Twenty years before the events described above, or about that Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Offnau, an unofficial public mood monitoring service, has prepared a small report on the persistence of low and average levels of violence in the same parts of the country where there is a shortage of violence.
"A lot has been done, and a lot is being done," she wrote, "to mitigate the innate aggressiveness of the people who fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these confused branches and narrow settlements of the area, where, despite the ramparts hovering over the fences, the sluggish and sluggish churches.
However, some qualities seem to be inescapable.
The higher the spire, it would seem, the lower the passions it generates.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows stories of even overcome obstacles, and proclaims its fervent belief in the virtue of marriage and family life, but not only the old rudeness retains its firm grip both in rural communities and in urban settlements, and in urban settlements.
“You have an annoying habit of writing too much,” her science supervisor said after reading the entire report.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to answer,” Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
Feminist?
Silence again.
“I ask,” said Luther Rabinowitz, “not because I am against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
We have no prejudice here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and commendable in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, such as those you have shown me.
Obviously, you yourself are biased against the church, and what you call “evil” and “rough” would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural vitality and energy.
To continue to offer about WHAT HAPPENED, IF ANYTHING HAPPENED, as if it had happened, if it ever happened, yesterday, means to deprive the country of the life force it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz was speaking.
Behind his head, pink like flamingo, the LED letters repeated the advice that Offnau had given the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
“Talk is better than silence, the word of a song is better than the written word, but there is nothing better than love.”
“I fully understand what you mean,” Esme Nussbaum replied quietly when she confirmed that her scientific supervisor had finished speaking, “and I don’t want to say anything except that we haven’t been cured as effectively as we convince ourselves.
I'm concerned that if we're not ready, we'll find that we're repeating the mistakes that originally led to what happened if the story happened.
Only this time we will cast our anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz connected the tips of his fingers to the pyramid.
This gesture should have meant endless patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “calling ‘mistakes’ actions that our grandfathers did or didn’t do.
You go too far and when you talk about that they threw out their “anger” and “distrust” on “others.”
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that, understanding the past, that is, defending the present, we are not talking about “us” and “them”.
There was no “us” and no “others.”
It was a time of turmoil – that’s all we know.
“For which, if you are honest with yourself,” Esme ventured, “no part of society can well justify itself.
I don't blame anyone.
Whether it’s good or bad, what’s done is done.
It was then.
There is nothing more to say, we agree.
And since no one should be blamed, no one should be excused if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why the past, if not in order to learn –
The past exists in order for us to forget it.
If I can add one word to it--
The pyramid of Luther Rabinowitz collapsed.
"I'll look into your report," he said, letting her go.
The next day, on her way to work, she was knocked down by a motorcyclist who had gone to the sidewalk, as described by passers-by, “in vicious rage.”
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho army says no coup was planned; Prime Minister remains in South Africa
Representatives of the Lesotho army denied the fact that they were preparing a coup to overthrow the government, saying that they were acting against the police, which they suspected in an attempt to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane has left the country, saying the country’s army has surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital, Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighbouring South Africa, saying he had received the threat of an assassination attempt on his life.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was, in fact, no coup, but that the army had responded to the threat from “political fanatics” whom the police were trying to arm.
“What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command took action by getting some intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that are really planning to arm some political, young political party fanatics who were ready to wreak havoc,” he told VOA.
A representative of the South African government, Claeson Monuela, said the army’s actions looked like a coup.
“While no one has claimed to have seized power by force, it is widely reported that the actions of the armed forces of Lesotho at the moment have the main signs of a coup,” he said.
Representatives of the Lesotho army said that the soldiers returned to the barracks on Sunday and that the capital was quiet.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mottejoa Metsing is running the government in the absence of Tabana.
Tabane said he believes he is being attacked in connection with an attempt to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his united government.
He said his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations to the contrary.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on rental rights in Milan, Milan Channel reports.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours to undergo a medical examination.
Last season, he was on the field as part of the London club only three times.
It should be noted that earlier Milan had rented from Liverpool striker Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at lowest level in 13 months
Production growth in the euro area slowed to its lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular study.
The latest value of the euro area manufacturing sector’s business activity index (PMI) by Markit fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have stalled, and businesses have suffered amid growing tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures came ahead of a meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
Markets will be waiting for a clear plan from the bank on how to deal with a halt to the eurozone’s recovery, as well as a threat of deflation at inflation of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that ECB chief Mario Draghi may give additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Although some growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more apparent,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The PMI of Germany’s manufacturing sector, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its 11-month low of 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc’s second-largest economy, France, PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concern, as does Italy’s weakening from steady growth to stagnation.
The signs that the growth momentum has been extinguished mainly by the industrial engine, Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add to the confidence,” Mr Dobson said.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to further fuel analysts who are waiting for the introduction of additional monetary or fiscal stimulus.
One positive news was from Ireland, where PMI rose to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August survey of the euro area manufacturing sector’s business activity index is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “Eurozone producers are obviously finding life very difficult at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tensions – especially related to Russia/Ukraine – add to the uncertainty of still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit business – and especially consumer confidence, and is likely to result in some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that “it is becoming more and more like” that the ECB will eventually have to conduct some sort of quantitative easing, “although we suspect it will be limited.”
The residents of Mariupol will put out a live chain against the militias
In Mariupol until last week everything was calm - no one rushed to organize the Mariupol People's Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Residents are now horrified by the arrival of “rebels”.
According to political scientists, the separatists break through to Mariupol to reach the Sea of Azov - the city of Novoazovsk was recently taken, which before was also not part of the self-proclaimed republics.
The Mariupols decided that the Ukrainian army, although it will defend them, but it has a little strength against the well-armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and they were going to help the military.
They dig trenches, build checkpoints and fortifications.
In the evening on Saturday several thousand residents came to the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a living chain, singing the anthem of Ukraine.
They are going to do the same in case of an attack.
Volunteers collect and transport equipment and products, collect medicines, publish a newspaper.
Shops are gradually closing in the city, banks and ATMs are shutting down.
Ten Years of Hell for the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years since the terrible seizure of the school, like the children who found themselves in it, still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day trial that shook the world.
We went back to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death during the school atrocities.
Exactly ten years after the terrible capture of the Beslan school, during which 334 people died, including 186 children, who heroically survived the disaster, warned last night about a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed something of an extreme possible evil.
The tragedy united the East and the West in disgust, which surprisingly then grew into action and hope for the future in the face of severe grief.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan, in southern Russia, to find some of the victims who had cheated death during the school atrocities.
We have found amazing young people who have faced adversity, although the memories of a terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that is now tormenting Ukraine, in which children like them are dying, will now end.
The girl who in the photo is trying to get back into the shooting sports hall
It is captured in the photo of the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Belyakov, when in one of her underwear she tried to get back into the shooting sports hall after the explosion of the mine.
In the confusion, Aida desperately looked for her mother, Larissa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both of them would die, but in fact they survived.
“The woman told me to run, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mother.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I may need more surgery.
There are a few pieces left in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people in the same way that doctors helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but she certainly didn’t break it,” she says with a challenge.
“It happened to me, and you can’t change that fact.
Once a year I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Zera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little, and we dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start working.
I'll think about the family later.
She says the capture stays with her, though the memories fade a little each year.
I am glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we are so grateful for the help we have received from people from the UK and everywhere.
When I see a photo on the internet where I climb into a school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy, and make sure it doesn’t happen again.
The boy who ran through the grad bullets, thinking his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (Russians start school at age 7) and he survived three days of hijacking by hugging his mother Tamara.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand."
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, "Run."
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and saw a crying baby on the way, grabbed the child's hand and ran through the city of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son from the outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara went to freedom and was in the hospital with leg injuries, in turn thinking that her son had died.
After their reunion, she said, "I cried with joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran away and hugged me.
Damira was later brought to London (now a non-existent News of the World newspaper), where he was awarded as a Child Defender by Barnardo's Foundation Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sherry.
“This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it,” he said yesterday.
Still, I can say that in my memory he faints.
I remember immediately after that I threw away all my toy weapons.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that’s not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard who never got out.
We never say they are dead or dead.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially the toy store where I was allowed to choose everything I wanted and the trip in an open-top car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to the kind of grief that he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
“I am so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors,” said Damir, who volunteered last week at a women’s monastery.
That's how I want to help.
I want to serve in the police force someday and I hope to be enrolled in the academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said: "37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the awful silence immediately after the capture, there were just no children screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She vividly remembers her trip with Damir to London.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the earth can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to "Sherry Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I'd like to call Sherry and just tell her that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscht, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant, Damir shooting them from his water gun, and they ran off and played with him.
And it was only a month after our nightmare then.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said: “I think the world hasn’t been better in 10 years.
Now there is a war going on in Ukraine, people are dying every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They're just kids like ours.
I think for a lot of people, war is a news story that they listen to when they’re bored or when they’re busy doing something else.
I just know how these people feel, the horror of it.
And I can't stop feeling it.
Nothing's changed, people still want to kill each other, and it's so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very soft and calm boy, he is not aggressive and not evil at all.
He is not looking for revenge, for example, he is not stuck in this past nightmare.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but they’re very close with six classmates and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it – I remember him lying on the couch, turning away from us, for hours.
He didn't sleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw away all his weapons and other military toys. Damira is now 17, he is above me, cute, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and got on my feet, I looked around, I saw hell around me, when parts of the body lay everywhere.
I was absolutely certain that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
“I remember yelling at him, ‘Damir, run, run,’ but again I was so sure he didn’t hear me.
But he heard and ran away.
So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
Georgiy Ilyin, 17 years old
A boy whose shocking photo after the capture was decisive for the tragedy in Beslan
Peace: Beslan survivor George Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and on the right George today
His bloody face was scarred when he escaped death, when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54, the chief physician, took him to school on the first day of school before taking Vladimir’s eldest son to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of nightmare,” she recalled.
Not quite alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only George was able to survive.
The closer this date is, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is not a day when we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it was long ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes these days all the time in front of my eyes.
No one will ever forget, I promise.
The photograph of George (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was immortalized in the sculpture (right).
I remember George wanting to go to school the day he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I just found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture of weeping George in San Marino.
George does not like to look at this photo, and it is hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but I also feel that thanks to this photo, people from all over the world feel our pain.
George now says, “It’s important that this never happens again.
“I doubt we’ll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and never learn the truth.
Now they are investigating this Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what caused it?
This world is going to something very bad.
“I can’t understand how this is happening because if you ask people, nobody wants war because it’s happening?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
We need decades to forget it a little bit.
It has affected my health, and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had nightmares because of the seizure, but now it’s getting better.
I went back to school later in 2004, I was very scared every day.
I was thinking about my friends and classmates who were killed.
That’s why I keep going to this gym before every September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget it, but I don't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and went to the medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I'm going to study to become a cardiosurgeon.
My first choice was to join the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it will not happen.
Georgiy Farniev, 20 years
The boy who survived, despite being at the feet of a terrorist-murderer
Unbelievable: George Farniev was at the feet of a terrorist-murderer during the capture, but still managed to survive
During the capture, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to a bomb at the feet of a terrorist killer.
Indeed, it is a miracle that he was not killed.
“We think it was just yesterday,” says George, who wanted to study for an intelligence officer at the FSB but could not because of the damage that was caused to his health during the capture.
It's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm older now, and they say that kids are easy to deal with bad things -- I have to say that's not true.
“In 2006 I worked with psychologists and I felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget that.
And I'd like to forget.
In 2005 - the following year - was the first and last time I entered this gym again.
I've lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don’t ask me to show you where I sat in this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgiy Farniev today with an open photo of himself in the hospital after the seizure
My pain is great, and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know that I don’t like to think about it or discuss it, and they’ve never asked me about school.
When it comes to health, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that was damaged, but now I'm walking normally.
But still health did not allow me to go to study at the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg, as I wanted.
I sent my papers, including medical reports, and they said it was impossible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to a veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals “from cats to cows”.
He said: "I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not something that children should know about, and certainly not something that they should survive.
His mother Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.
It's in my soul, worse when the anniversary approaches.
I will go and attend the ceremonies that will be held to mark it.
I know George won't go.
For him it must be even stronger because he was there and I was not.
I waited for him at home and couldn't help.
I am so grateful to God that he has returned to me. Here in Beslan, the imprint is on everyone.
He's staying with us.
George is now an adult, but this nightmare is still with him.
It's hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he loves sports, but he can't do them because of his knee.
He had several surgeries, he can walk, but he can't do sports.
I would say that he has overcome this nightmare by 50%, but it is impossible to completely overcome and forget it.
This horrible experience will stay with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and that only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could give me, but my heart hurts for those who have been killed.
I know the families where the new children were born, but I also know the widows who never married again.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what's going on in the world -- wars in different regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were one friendly country in the past, how did it turn out that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If it were possible to capture all the rebels and throw them out - as far as possible.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10 years
The baby, which was moved to a safe place by a special forces fighter
Rescued: Alena Tskayev is carried to a safe place by a Russian special forces fighter (left).
Now she has ten (right), and she does not remember at all about the monstrous crime
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when little Alena was taken out of school in Beslan by a Russian policeman.
The terrorists released her, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Christina and brother Mahara in the school gym.
Mahar, then three years old, escaped, but Alena’s mother and sister were killed in a deadly battle.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried, and they have a young daughter with his new wife Svetlana, whom he named Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alena, who is now ten, remembers nothing about the capture and blossomed into a smart and cheerful girl, the neighbors say.
“They’re a big happy family now, and Alaina and Mahar are both beautiful children,” says a close friend.
Ruslan is a wonderful father and wants to keep them away from all memories when the tenth anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Halfback Shinji Kagawa, who has returned from Manchester United to Dortmund's Borussia Dortmund, said he was looking forward to being able to return to the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyous event in his career.
Of course, I am very happy that I will be playing for Borussia again, - says Bild Kagawa.
I feel very good.
Full of positive emotions and looking forward to when I can get back on the field in the form of "Borussia".
Recall, Kagawa moved to "MU" from "Borussia" in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he never managed to get a foothold in the English club, having spent only 38 matches in the English Championship in two seasons, scoring 6 goals and giving 8 assists.
Man accused of assaulting a girl on a pedestrian crossing "pelican" in Fife
The 78-year-old man will appear in court on charges of assaulting a three-year-old girl at a pedestrian crossing “pelican” in Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly shot the girl at a crossing in Pittenwine, East New York.
Prosecutors said Mr. Stewart drove his Audi Q3 without proper care and attention and shot the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stewart, 78, of Anstr<0xC3><0xBC>ter, denied his guilt in the Dundee Sheriff's Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the royal lawyer, has set a court date for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande will not open in Vladivostok
Duty-free shopping store of Vladivostok airport has displayed a sign prohibiting purchases in this store to a number of world political leaders.
Do not give them spirits, vodka and cognac.
The store’s administration has decided that U.S. President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Vitali Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, the Prime Minister of Japan and a few other well-known comrades will not be able to indulge in vodka, cognac and spirits in their store.
I put a sign on the door.
Earlier, Obama received a ban on appearing in an even less accessible institution by type of service - Dietary canteen MSU, as reported by the institution's website.
Whether the American president ever dreamed of eating in a dietician’s dining room in Russia is not known, but the authors of the bans clearly seem to themselves terribly witty.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that under the conditions of the embargo, Russian agrarians should master new technologies in order to arrange the production of cheese varieties in demand from buyers.
The advice was given during a visit to the company "Yugptitseprom" of the company "Agrocomplex".
The head of government also advised restaurateurs to refocus on Russian meat, the quality of which is at an appropriate level.
The annual embargo on food imports has been imposed in Russia since August 7.
The head coach of the Russian national team Valentin Maslakov is pleased with the results of the DecaNation tournament.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result, given the lack of targeted preparation for competitions.
Our athletes performed at their level, - quotes "All sport" the words of Maslakov.
Third place is the confirmation of our high enough team level.
It is a pleasure that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
It should be noted that we were not prepared for this competition.
The season is over, and we have not forced our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years we have become the second in this tournament, but this season we have renewed the team.
The French, on the other hand, exhibited a combat-ready team that included 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which has been publicly announced many times.
But even such a composition of the owners of the competition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians acted in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some species were in order lower than in the same "Brilliant League".
Season's over.
Naturally, the result is no longer so important for athletes, especially in team level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, there was an absurdity, when for 1500 m men were so passionate about tactical tricks of running that they showed the result below the average level... women's races.
4 tips on how to achieve better quality underwater photos and videos
If you want to photograph or shoot videos underwater, you have a number of options for equipment.
The cheapest option is a water-resistant "washer", for example, the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, for example, the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which sell for about $300.
I took these pictures on a family holiday with a few cameras, all for about $350.
No matter what equipment you use, a few rules must be followed in order to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Also, set up your camera for the type of photos or videos you’ll be shooting.
Some cameras and video cameras have shooting modes or object type that optimize exposure for darkened underwater conditions.
And before you jump into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can sink.
Some cameras are designed for only 5 feet, others - 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our buyer’s guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few pictures - because many of them will not work.
The soapboxes have LCDs that will help you compose photos, while the action cameras usually don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it will be difficult to see under water, and the framing will be a random process.
So take a few shots.
Also, if your camera has a serial shooting mode that takes a few shots with slightly different exposure settings, use them.
Stay on the surface.
The amount of light is significantly reduced the deeper you dive under the water.
If possible, stay on the surface when shooting in a pool, river, or ocean.
It will also allow you to convey more color in the photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get closer to the shooting targets.
This is great advice for shooting on land, but it’s even more important underwater because of the dim light conditions.
Especially important if you are shooting on an action camera: This equipment is often equipped with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means that you will have to approach the shooting objects if you want to fill the shot.
The bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympic Games for the free fight Bilal Mahov may move to the Greco-Roman fight.
This was reported by the head coach of the team of Dagestan on free fight Sajid Sajidov.
The specialist did not exclude the participation of the athlete at the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
At the moment, Bilal Mahov is at the gathering of the team of "classics", - quotes "R-Sport" the words of Sazhid Sazhidov.
In general, the junior Bilal acted in both styles.
At the 2005 World Youth Championships, he became the winner of the volunteer tournament and the third prize winner in the Greco-Roman competitions and decided to focus on the free fight.
It has long been rumored that the new stage of his career our heavyweight will spend in the Greco-Roman struggle.
I will say more: Mahov can already perform at the world championship in Tashkent - if he wins the nickname.
But the decisive word is always behind the coaching staff headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose power of personality could shake everything around him, even in a giant organization like the National Health Service.
A consultant anesthesiologist, he devoted his career to ridding patients of both the suffering of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among those who appealed to him, his wife recalls, was an MI-6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors are fascinated by diagnoses and diseases, those who undergo treatment mostly worry about something completely different – pain.
Once in 2007, however, he was the one who began to suffer.
“I didn’t feel like I used to,” he wrote in May of last year.
It was hard for me to find strength.
Struggling with flu-like symptoms, he found that he was angry at his wife, Juliet.
“I want everything to happen faster, not later,” he said.
When Juliet left for business for a week, Lawson found that it was unusual and unclear why he was upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to do a chest X-ray.
Just two weeks earlier, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
X-rays have arrived.
It was a mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or the lining of the lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine the exact cause.
Although some smokers have lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients have smoked.
But with mesothelioma in a different way.
In almost all cases, the cause is contact with asbestos, a fibrous building material that was once called a “miracle,” but which is now known to be fatally dangerous.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when the recommended industrial ban came into effect.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked closely with it: pipe insulators, builders, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
An industrial toxin from a different era, it is hardly seen as a cause for concern today.
But that calm is wrong.
The UK is now at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic.
More people are dying from mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of about 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from the disease as from car accidents.
Annual number of deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and projected number of future deaths in the UK
The reason why we feel its deadly effects now is that although the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), it usually takes decades to develop mesothelioma.
And the attack of mesothelioma is not limited to veterans of industrial construction.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases remains, embedded in the homes where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, level of wealth, profession or age.
The bastions of choice, from fashionable London department stores to private schools, did not turn out to be salvation.
The building is covered with asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are designed to treat us have turned out to be reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson wasn't old.
He wasn't an insulator.
In fact, he had to think about where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he realized.
“It seems there could have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Gaia Hospital, where I spent six years on an internship,” he wrote.
All of the students, nurses, doctors, and carriers used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
It was a question that, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer to.
“Of the four doctors who trained in Gaia’s hospital and who subsequently developed mesothelioma over the past five years,” he noted in a letter in 2010, “I’m the only one left alive.”
How many of us will get this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died, on February 17 of this year, he was 55.
To live so long is unusual.
Fifty percent of mesothelioma patients die 8 months after diagnosis.
It's always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will get the same disease?”
According to the leading expert on mesothelioma in the UK, Professor Julian Pieto, it is most likely to suggest that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is due to survive, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people don’t know they’re going to die that way.

A quick review of reports from courtrooms, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the attack of mesothelioma has spread.
This June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that they had unsupervisedly exposed Janis Ellen to asbestos.
She worked on the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, managing clothing departments at two sites, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was just 18 years old when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children over 20 years old.
“Before that happened,” she says, “I’d never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn’t believe it would affect me.
Few people really know much about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
They got their name from the word "asbestiform", which means a fibrous structure that communicates strength and flexibility to them.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotile, widely known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roofing panels, floor tiles, thermal insulation of pipes, boiler seams, even in brake pads of cars.
It is less deadly than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage” that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, are brown asbestos (amozite) and blue asbestos (crochidolite).
The UK was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that “there are strong, though indirect, grounds to believe that this is the main reason for the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK].”

Janice Ellen may not have thought of herself as the typical victim of mesothelioma, but Juliana Pitto’s work suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that “a substantial percentage of mesothelioma, when there is no known exposure at work or at home, was most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment.”
Most of that impact, he says, is due to “usual use and weather effects” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure he's safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the very center of government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard reported that technical mines and pipelines outside parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be driven into motion by something as innocuous as “strong airflows.”
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems the opposite is true.
Although the Parliament’s Maintenance Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster did not receive a “pure sanitary certificate”, it now acknowledged that it is necessary to carry out work on the <0xC2><0xA3>1 billion reconstruction of the Parliament, improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, members of the Parliament will be able to do so.
The Goddard report noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed in accordance with different rules.”
It is impossible to know whether this error of management will cost lives.
All we can do now is wait.
One of those who has never been able to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects he was exposed to asbestos when he worked in hospitals.
“I worked at a hospital that successfully filed asbestos-related lawsuits,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places where he worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009, when he was struck by something that looked like the flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of surgery late at night.
Suddenly, I began to get fever.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I wouldn't be able to drive all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew the pain was coming from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
However, like Janis Ellen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
After all, he could not go to work for a month.
The puzzled doctors took X-rays of the chest cell and placed pleural catheters to pull the fluid out of the lungs and send it for analysis.
However, his condition remained undiagnosed.
Gradually his health improved, and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he exercised and took a hard breath.
In 2011, one of Abbott's patients came to him at the reception with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with "mesothelioma".
However, even then Abbott did not link this to his own case.
After all, his patient was decades older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his consulting doctor showed his CT results and X-rays to a group of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began to feel ill, a sensor equipped with a camera was inserted into the cavity between the lining of his chest and the lining of his lungs.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going,” he says.
I wasn't too worried about that, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: “I was told it was a mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott: Mesothelioma Diagnosed
Abbott suddenly sank into a meeting with Macmillan's nurses, one of whom offered to contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the scale of the epidemic.
“It turns out that asbestos was widely used, especially in large public buildings where asbestos thermal insulation was quite common on pipes,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting the disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people of unusual professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated tubes in hospitals were in basements, so patients are unlikely to be affected.
But many employees who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson), or ate in basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) almost certainly were exposed to a toxic substance.
For decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were a place where, theoretically, life was saved for the patients, but a place that posed a threat to the lives of the doctors who treated them.
It is still being removed today.
Schoolchildren installed their Bunzen burners on asbestos substrates
And it's not just hospitals.
Asbestos has often been used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its amazing insulating and fireproof characteristics.
schools as well.
In fact, many were most likely exposed to asbestos in the classroom for the first time.
Across the country, at countless chemistry classes, schoolchildren set their Bunzen burners on asbestos racks.
There are websites that focus on the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, harmless things like floor tiles or shed roofs tended to contain asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison embedded in a huge number of our buildings,” says Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in a case against Gaia Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
Therefore, be careful, tear down the garden sheds.
The effect of the diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is enormous.
“It takes a lot of time to realize that,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and deal with myself.
Well, I'll never see Christmas again.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of the doctor to the position of the patient.
As the countless number of patients before him, he remembers how he was overwhelmed with the amount of information that had to be received.
“It was hard to understand everything,” he says.
“I asked my doctor, ‘How much time do I have?’
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see Christmas anymore.
That's all."
Mesothelioma is especially dangerous because it is the mechanics of how we support life – the very act of breathing – that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos breaks down and the fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the pleura, the lining of the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem arises from the inhalation of asbestos needle fibers,” said Professor Tom Treger, a cardiothoracic surgeon who came to Gaia Hospital in 2001.
It was the hospital where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading center for the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treger knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely exposed while interning in the hospital.
When asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, Treger says, “breathing pushes them to the periphery where the shell is located.
This is essentially an invasive process right from the start.
The usual treatment options for other forms of cancer are much less effective with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, causes hot disputes.
Some people think it’s worth trying.
The Treasurer disagrees.
"It's impossible to cut the pleura," he says.
It's impossible to get around her with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer “is not very well-suited to chemotherapy,” which “acts” but does not cure.
“From time to time, there are patients who live a long time,” Treger says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Steven J. Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis, had become a sole support and consultation bureau for the same patients.
"Hello, Cancer Central," he said cheerfully when they called.
“He was very positive,” Abbott says.
He was diagnosed 4 years ago and he is still very energetic.
First, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would take four months and extend his life by just one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to surrender.
Lawson, however, "did manage to give everything a slightly more positive color."
After meeting with several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loik Lange-Lazdunski, a professor of thoracic surgery at Gaia Hospital.
“We had the advantage that I didn’t need directions, I just called them and they accepted me,” Graham admits.
The average patient would have to get referral and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to get the best treatment available.
However, when such treatment finally proves to be ineffective, many patients are faced with yet another financial cause for concern – the future of the families they leave behind.
And then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Asbestos has been known to be harmful to health since 1898,” says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it became clear that even very small amounts could put health at risk.
It was then that we talked about the unfairness of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Gaia’s hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn’t a “full-cost settlement,” according to Morgan, as Lawson couldn’t conclusively prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Gaia’s hospital.
After the investigation of his death, a representative of Gaia Hospital confirmed, however, that "asbestos in the basement rooms in question was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
Actually, tying deadly asbestos contact to one company or workplace — usually decades later — has proven to be a major problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed owners or closed down.
The insurance records could have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that time on their side, which the plaintiffs, of course, do not have.
In response, serious new legislation has emerged this year that makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to recover compensation, even if their former employers cannot be traced.
Under this law, a <0xC2><0xA3>350 million fund funded by the insurance industry has been set up for those who have been diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but who has no one to judge.
In such cases, patients will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court could award in the ordinary compensation case – about <0xC2><0xA3>120000.
About 300 successful claims under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that <0xC2><0xA3>350 million represents a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
“This is a deal written by insurers for insurers,” he says, hinting that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the temporary gap hadn’t intervened and mesothelioma patients could have tracked down the company and filed a lawsuit in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, the former Minister of Labour and Pensions, admitted that the law was “imperfect.”
However, both Penning and Morgan admit that, while seven people die every day, swift action was needed.
“People are suffering so much, and they need help today,” Penning said during a second reading of the Bill on Mesothelioma last December.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loika Lange-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazdunsky recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treger, he considers effective.
This was followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a tritherapy in which Lange-Lazdunsky can boast as many as 40 percent of the surviving patients in five years.
Abbott felt a surge of strength.
“It’s certainly one of the most important things,” Abbott says.
You see this in patients all the time.
There is a power that supports you.
When you give up, the condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent surgery in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no trace of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots [cancers] in my chest.
I should have turned 50.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
Again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
There's no sign of any tumors now.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things like finances when I die, for example, or showing my wife how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you become unhappy.
We need to look ahead.
Like Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Tamzin's father, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
“It’s hard for a parent,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I wouldn’t live to be old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamzin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all her friends, and we got a lot of calls very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients have to face.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced by hope, even the glimmer of opportunity to survive.
This disease carries with it (even as, ultimately, for Stephen Jay Gould) a dark certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not a threat to life.
The bodies of embalmed pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos fabrics.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen pots and increase heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
Now a non-flammable canvas has been invented.
I've seen napkins made out of it smelting in the fireplaces at the banquets.
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are opened in Canada and South Africa and soon after in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the ideal heat insulator for steam engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution.
Global asbestos production is growing to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Statistics from Prudential reveal premature mortality among those who work with asbestos and who, as a result, are denied life insurance.
Nelly Kershaw is dying in Rockdale.
Dr. William Cook testified that asbestos particles in her lungs “were, without a doubt, the leading cause of death.”
This is the first case of this type.
Kershaw's employers, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not accept responsibility.
Compensation is not paid.
During the Second World War, shipbuilding is developing intensively, one of the most deadly professions in terms of contact with asbestos.
Voluntary industrial ban on the import of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful claim for health damage caused as a result of contact with asbestos in the UK.
Global asbestos production is growing to more than 4213,000 tons per year.
The UK imports 139,000 tonnes.
The UK’s Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety requires all contractors working with asbestos to be licensed.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All use of asbestos is banned in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act was passed in the UK.
A compensation scheme of <0xC2><0xA3>350 million has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
Global production is maintained at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to choose leaders; protesters vow revenge
China’s parliament on Sunday decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 election, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
This move is likely to kick off long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district as activists began planning and mobilizing within hours of the statement.
The decision of the All-China People’s Congress, in essence, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
“It hasn’t fooled our expectations, but it still angers us,” said Democratic Party Chairwoman Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They fooled the people of Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China’s decision, Lee Fei, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee of the All-China People’s Congress, said that allowing a popular bid for the election of Hong Kong’s leader would be too “chaotic.”
Since 1997, when the United Kingdom transferred control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow residents of the region to elect a head of government by voting, starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic step forward, as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of the nomination commission, tightly controlled by Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision was made after the summer, when some of the largest and widely publicized protests in Hong Kong over many years took place.
Much of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy campaign is backed by the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down Hong Kong’s financial district if Beijing does not guarantee a genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the statement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said that their movement is moving to a new stage of civil disobedience and that they will rise on the waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not disclose the details, apparently seeking to avoid problems with the state authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement “considered the possibility of seizing the central area only as an exceptional measure, an action that can only be taken if all the possibilities of dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret to inform you that to date all possibilities of dialogue have been exhausted and the seizure of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
Hong Kong's state authorities were preparing for Beijing's statement for several days, and security measures with police and barricades were tightened at the government headquarters on Sunday.
At the heart of the unrest is the feeling among many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their own city.
The inflow of residents from the mainland strengthens competition in the field of goods and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are starting to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations put businesses at risk – a source of Hong Kong’s life-force.
“The protest they’re talking about can lead to a lot of economic damage depending on how many people will be involved and how long,” said Legislator Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don’t want to see any concern that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
This is a concept that is harmful to investment.
Chinese state-run media have also been reporting in recent days that Hong Kong activists of the democratic movement have been shown to be subversives directed by Western powers.
This summer, activists staged an informal referendum on the right to vote, which drew 780,000 participants – more than one-fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
American graduation culture reaches university life: first-year students were offered to arrive on a personal plane
We are pleased to respond to this demand by launching the UK’s first luxury travel service for current students.
To leave a vivid impression of the arrival at the university, the company also offers transportation options such as a personal jet, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service had thought about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their belongings across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new VIF options, we look forward to helping students reach university this year with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
The company said that since the service has just been launched, no orders have been received yet, but added that “students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks.”
The company also stated that despite the fact that students are required to pay <0xC2><0xA3>9,000 per year for training, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: more important than ever, to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes.
However, the National Union of Students criticized this service as being disconnected from reality.
Megan Dunn, vice president of the NSC for Higher Education, said: “This project seems incredibly detached from the lives of most students.
Many students who will start studying at university this month face a cost-of-living crisis when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to make up for the rapidly growing cost of basic needs, before they can even begin to think about making thousands of pounds a living.
Feminists raise the issue of race and police behavior after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
Those who came raise their hands, chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot," while they wait in line before the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who left comments put gender above race, when it came to the promotion of reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions in the Midwest grew and attracted national attention, Perez saw the responses of white women who focused 100 percent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women soon after the August 9 murder, personal essays with headlines such as “Feminism is not just about oppressing women” and “Feminism is not just about oppressing women” appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
“In feminism, I don’t think there are many people who talk about white skin color and privileges at such a high level,” she said.
People felt the need to say something about what had happened.
It’s very symbolic of the crisis we’re facing, and because [the situation in Ferguson] is so tied to race, they felt they needed to point that out.
For Professor of English at the University of Ohio at Coritas, Mitchell Ferguson has uncovered the problems that black Americans face every day, but which are not perceived as “women’s problems” in the cultural sphere.
“I can write something funny on Facebook about what’s going on with me and my partner, and I’ll get 150 likes from everywhere,” Mitchell says.
When I write something about how people of color are being attacked in their own country, the silence is deafening.
“Why is it safe for women to speak publicly about relationships, but not about public safety?” she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly share these issues; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women are now uniting issues of race and gender in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hather, a professor of women’s and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
“Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the basis for this has almost always been the rape of a white woman,” Hather said.
It took a white woman to corroborate the story to justify lynching.
From Hatter’s point of view, the divide between white and black women occurred when white suffragettes, for example, Susan B. Anthony studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for suffrage would be effective only for one of the groups: women or blacks.
“They decided to put all the eggs in the basket of women’s voting rights, and blacks’ voting rights should have come later,” Hather said.
Looking back on such things gives us a clear idea of why colored women don’t trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynching in the Southern Women’s Association to prevent lynching.
The group emerged almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell’s point of view, the rise of white feminists’ reactions to the problems raised by the Ferguson situation – police behavior, racial discrimination – reflects a time when white feminists had to “catch up” with the problems that black women have faced for generations.
“Would it be great if activists who have such a [traditional feminist] ideology would take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to contraception?” she asked.
Second-wave feminists, who have made careers in the fight for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives, are now beginning to understand what this means.
A well-known white feminist activist, Gloria Steinem, took advantage of Facebook two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown and published a sharp article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll, which demanded that white Americans take more part in protests over racism.
“I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger in the body — and views on racial issues that differ significantly in public surveys — will be at the forefront of change,” Steinem wrote.
While Steinem vouched for a more intersecting feminism that included both racial and gender issues, her comments about race in America still surprised some.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Entrepreneurship Institute, the author of “Who Stole Feminism?”, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially colored young men, are “much more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Steinem’s remarks about Ferguson contradict the criticism she expressed.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, “Watch My Brother,” to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking young men, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police’s relationship with the black community is not the only problem that advances the cutting edge of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Patrol arrested about 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country’s southwestern border this year, immigration reform has surfaced again – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present the issue as important to women, she needed only to share the stories of immigrant women.
"They speak for themselves," Mercado said.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued to [immigrant men], the women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories resonate with women’s organizations,” she said.
Ipswich house "with a pig" for sale
The photo of the house for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out that it depicted a large pig resting in the living room.
Set up for sale for <0xC2><0xA3>120000, a separate one-bedroom house stands on a private road in Ipswich.
A detailed description was distinguished by a photo of the living room of the house - in which was depicted a pig with a head resting on the sofa.
The real estate agency Connells reported that the pig in the photo is the pet of the owner of the house.
"However, the photo was placed by mistake and has already been removed," a company spokesman said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former meeting house as "a unique one-bedroom detached house".
Despite the fact that the agency has removed the photo from its website, it is still preserved in advertising materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social media, where some asked if the pig was being sold along with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, who conceded Karolin Wozniacki in the fourth round of the US Open, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to finish the year with dignity and try to reach a new level, reports Vasily OSIPOV from New York.
How do you generally rate your results at the Grand Slam tournaments this year?
Of course, I'm glad I beat Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I lacked stability, especially at the end of some matches.
Of course, I'm upset now.
I couldn’t even get to the quarterfinals.
What tasks do you set for yourself before the end of the season?
“After an insulting defeat, I have a huge motivation to go to a new level.
I have something to work on, and I’m going to do everything I can to finish the year decently.
The Asian series of tournaments begins in a couple of weeks.
A member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nikolai Valuev proposed for compliance with GTO norms to give bonuses when entering universities.
According to him, in general, the standards will be the same as in Soviet times, - people will pass the standards for stretching, running and other exercises.

In the city of Harvey in South Wales appeared a new millionaire after winning the lottery
The player in the lottery from Harvey this month.
A search is underway for a new millionaire in the southwest of Perth, where one lucky man will take home nearly $1.1 million from Saturday night’s lottery draw.
The Harvey newsstand brings gold in the main prize draw for the second time in five years, the previous win amounted to $1 million in November 2009.
However, a lucky winner still needs to declare himself.
The owner of the shop, Steve Forward, said the win caused a stir in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole town is talking about it, and everyone is very excited.
We thought that such a win could be secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated the main prize win last month, marking the end of a few lucky weeks for the state’s players.
Last week, the Canning Vale player became one of five millionaires in August, following the pair’s huge $7.5 million win from Belmont just a few weeks before.
The winning couple has been playing for twenty years and reported that the win gave them the opportunity to travel around the world and buy a new home.
A Harvey millionaire brings the number of top prize winners in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total prize pool of $85 million.
The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric vehicle market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of environmentally friendly transport in Russia, said Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry Oleg Pluzhnikov at a round table, which was held by Vedomosti at the Moscow Motor Show - 2014.
The plan is drawn up on the instructions of the government, one of the main goals is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September - the beginning of October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures concern electric vehicles and hybrids - the plan for the development of vehicles on gas-powered fuel in Russia already exists.
The plan (a copy is available from "Vedomosti") is designed for 2014-2017.
The evaluation criteria for electric and hybrid transport will be developed and how to stimulate the use and production of environmentally friendly vehicles will be decided.
The report to the government, which will describe tax and customs measures to support electric transport, will be prepared by December 2014; the scheme of preferential lending and preferential leasing will appear by April 2015; and proposals to reduce the price of machines, stimulate localization and create service infrastructure will be developed by 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to make changes to regulatory acts to facilitate conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (in parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities during 2015 to also stimulate the use of environmentally friendly transport - in the form of providing it with advantages in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 - and proposals to expand public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will add to the list of indicators of evaluation of the activities of regional authorities criteria reflecting the effectiveness of supporting the production of environmentally friendly transport, the development of charging infrastructure.
The electric car market in Russia is still forming - in 2013 about 100 electric cars were sold throughout the country.
At the beginning of 2014, the import duty on electric cars was zeroed, so sales will be about 500 units, predicts the CEO of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia Andrei Pankov.
But the five-fold growth does not make electric cars any noticeable: in 2013, according to the Association of European Business, 2.78 million cars and light commercial vehicles were sold in Russia.
So far, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric vehicles to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start importing – the company focuses primarily on corporate customers, says Nicolas Remiz, Renault’s director of strategic planning and partnerships in Russia.
Most of the other manufacturers of electric transport took a waiting position with regard to Russia.
The development of electric vehicles has Russian manufacturers - "", GAZ, "", but the output is negligible.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to ASM-holding, AvtoVAZ produced 30 electric vehicles.
The demand is low due to the high cost of electric vehicles, acknowledges the director of "AvtoVAZ" engineering Sergei Amanov, without state support there will be no breakthrough in this segment.
The development of the Russian market of electric vehicles in addition to the cost of cars (the electric vehicles sold in Russia, on average, are twice as expensive as internal combustion engines) curbs the underdevelopment of the charging infrastructure (fuel - units), sighs the general director of "Autostat".
Due to the high cost and low rates of reduction in the cost of electric cars in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, predicts the editor-in-chief of "Avtorev" Mikhail Podorozhansky, Celikov agrees with him.
Automakers, on the contrary, say that some models of electric vehicles are already close to the cost of the usual.
The Russian electric car market has good prospects, the main thing is to instill confidence in consumers that “electric mobility” is real; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of new charging stations, emphasizes the president of the BMW Group in Russia Wolfgang Schlimme.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the state-owned company Rosseti: several stations have been built in Moscow, about 80 more will soon appear.
Negotiations on the construction of the fuel network are also underway with other regions.
According to Vladimir Sofyin, director of the Rosseti department, the company believes in the electric vehicle market and is ready to build gas stations throughout the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of various brands.
In addition, Rossetti, as a network company, does not have the right to sell electricity, it is working out the possibility of doing this in relation to charging electric vehicles.
Pankov considers the most effective measure of state support for the formation in Russia of the market of electric vehicles zeroing customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of extending it, expanding the preferential list is being explored.
Replacing transport tax with environmental (the idea is discussed and applies to all machines) will also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
Transport tax in Russia is low, Pankov says, unlike, for example, Norway, where the tax reduction has led to a sharp increase in sales of electric vehicles - now they account for 12% of the market.
Russia also needs incentives for car owners, such as free parking in the center of the city (as they have already done in Moscow), Pankov believes, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles on dedicated lanes, which is not yet available in Russia.
A private plane crashed in Colorado.
The Piper PA-46 single-engine plane crashed in Colorado.
Three of the five people in it were killed, reports ITAR-TASS.
The survivors were taken to the hospital.
The crash occurred a few miles from the runway of Denver's airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In the Donetsk region are dealing with captured fighters of the battalion "Donbass".
Punishers were surrounded by Ilovaisk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of security forces were killed by shelling.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation was in the southeast of Ukraine, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
Punishers from the Donbass battalion remained alive after the “meat grinder” they fell into under Ilovaisk.
Surrounded by the army of the Donetsk People’s Republic, the militants spent several days, in fact thrown out by their commanders and authorities of Ukraine.
When it was reported from the headquarters that it was possible to get out of the "ring" along the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But literally a few minutes later, shells and bullets were fired from all sides.
"Judging by the information that was given to me, we had a corridor, we were allowed to go out," says the deputy commander of the battalion, which has a call "Lermontov".
And when we went down into the lowlands between Mnogopol and Chervonoselsky, a cross fire started with anti-tank guided missiles, with "ears", grenade launchers of 30 mm, automatic BMD guns, small arms.
There were four cars in front of me and three in the back, in the end there were only two cars left.
The officer with the nickname "Lermontov" says: almost immediately killed at least 60 people, dozens were wounded, many died later.
Survivors are now being treated by those they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called "terrorists" treat them well, give them food, medicines.
At the same time, their own commanders actually deceived them and sentenced them to death.
They just betrayed us, they say.
Colonel, the whole battalion to destroy it.
In the battalion "Donbass", like many of his comrades, Alexei volunteered, because in the Ukrainian news they told about the atrocities allegedly committed in the south-east "separatists".
Already here Alexey saw a completely different picture.
His mother was killed in Luhansk - and not someone, but the Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that there was a mortar attack, that it was probably the Ukrainian armed forces, - says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to get out of the battalion.
They didn't let us out of Iowa, they said we were in the ring.
I already agreed with the commander, the report has already written about the departure.
We were immediately taken to Ilovaisk with Zurakhovo’s fees.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were trapped in the “boiler” near Ilovaisk.
Now some survivors admit that if time could be turned back, they would not have entered the punitive battalion for anything.
All the prisoners were handed over to the DPR security forces.
Everyone will be screened for involvement in war crimes.
In the region, a headquarters for limiting the prices of products was established
In Krasnoyarsk Krai, a headquarters has been established, which, if necessary, will limit the increase in the prices of products on the market in the region.
The order to create this structure has already been signed.
The headquarters consisted of members of the regional government, representatives of the executive branch and supervisory agencies.
All together they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the region.
News Economy <0xE2><0x80><0x95> Will Kiev "Rosneft" compensate $140 million in losses?
The head of Rosneft Igor Sechin said that the company estimates the damage from the shelling of the Lisichansk refinery in Ukraine at $140 million.
He said this in an interview with Spiegel.
"We estimate the damage at $140 million and will negotiate with the Ukrainian government on compensation payments," Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the modernized company Lisichanski NPZ was planned in 2014.
However, part of the plant was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
"There were no battles, there were no "buried rebels", but the Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, the technological oil pumped into the pipes has disappeared," he said.
Recall that on July 18 in connection with the shelling of the Lisichansk refinery burned a reservoir for storing oil and destroyed the buildings of two warehouses.
Lisichansk Refinery - the main oil refinery in Ukraine, the first stage of the enterprise was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichan refinery is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The plant is capable of producing fuel of the “Euro-4” standard, as well as diesel fuel batch of the “Euro-5” standard.
In March 2012, the supply of oil to the Lisichansk Refinery was suspended due to its loss.
The company decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisichansk Refinery together with other Ukrainian assets TNK-VR.
The DPRK launched a short-range projectile in the direction of the Japanese Sea.
According to South Korean media, this happened around 10:30 a.m. local time by the Chagando province, which is on the border of North Korea and China.
According to the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, the missile allegedly fell into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.

Now, investors are already pre-playing the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
However, for now, it looks more like an artificial hysteria inflated through the media, especially the Western ones.
There are not many options for introducing new sanctions against Russia.
TeleTrade "At the opening of the Moscow Stock Exchange, the ruble continues to sharply weaken against the bi-currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains the determining factor.
However, if in the near future we do not see a new negative, both the Russian indices and the position of the national currency can be adjusted.
"Orenburg Airlines" will compete with "Ideal Tour"
"Orenburg Airlines" presented "Ideal-tour" claims for a total amount of 4.7 billion rubles.
There are two issues that will be discussed in October.
The cases will be heard by different judges.

The CEO of the airline Viktor Zyukin speaks about the amount of 1.6 billion rubles.
Director General of Aeroflot Vitaly Saveliev calls an even larger amount - two billion rubles.
Twitter is trying to make it more interesting for new users
Twitter’s microblogging service has changed the process of registering users to engage new members more quickly in active interaction with the platform.
This measure should reduce the number of people who have left their microblogs.
Now, new Twitter users will be browsing through a large number of service-recommended accounts during registration to immediately form their reading circle.
The recommendations are drawn up on the basis of the interests indicated in the registration.
At the same time, Twitter automatically sets up a subscription link for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to manually remove the twigs, so as not to read those who are not interested.
If before, microblogging users only saw avatars of recommended users, then now Twitter is taking a sample of one of the popular blogger’s tweets to help make an impression on the person.
This is the biggest change to Twitter’s registration page in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been actively working on the modernization of the service.
This activity is associated, first of all, with the ongoing attempts of the service to achieve inviolability.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowdown in user base growth and a drop in reader activity.
The company is currently in desperate need of a greater number of loyal consumers who, once in a while, would stay for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising funds.
The day of knowledge in Moscow will be bright and rainy
The first of September in the Moscow region throughout the day will be cool and rainy, according to meteorologists.

The car recycling program has been renewed since September 1.
From September 1, the program for the disposal of cars in Russia is resumed.
By December 31, 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As the head of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov explained, the money is allocated from the limits, which have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other areas of support.
The program will cover all cars over the age of six.
The amount of compensation will be from 40 thousand for a car to 350 thousand rubles for a truck.
Earlier in Russia there was already a similar program of car recycling.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is planned not only to recycle cars for a subsequent discount, but also the possibility, if the car has reached the age of more than six years, to purchase a new one with a discount when handing the old one in the "trade-in" from the dealer, reports Interfax.
More than 16 billion rubles were spent on the previous federal recycling program, which ran from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of passenger cars in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million units (this is an increase of 101.4% compared to 2009).
The creator of Coming Out Simulator will release a game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Case, known for the game Coming Out Simulator, decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He told about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact has only gained widespread notoriety now.
The inspiration for the game was the events in Ferguson, where protests are now taking place, which began after a policeman killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which does not yet have a title, will be how informational coverage of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will need to photograph what is happening in areas where clashes between the police and the population take place.
The hero can take different pictures of what is happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots the scene in such a way that the police will look like heroes, and the protesters will look like bandits, the police will start treating him better and letting him where the ordinary person can not go.
If he illuminates events differently, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into large-scale riots.
Points in the game will need to be scored with the help of the hero's twitter, in which new subscribers will appear, if the photos displayed there will be popular.
The game has no name yet.
The date of release and the platform on which it will appear is unknown.
Case, however, published an image demonstrating how the event could change depending on how the photo about it was taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but initially wanted to dedicate it not to protests in the United States, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he started collecting material for the game, the game designer realized that he lacked the knowledge and skills to shed light on the history of the region.
However, when he saw the media covering the events in Ferguson, he decided to make the game based on what happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who produces browser-based games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells about the events from the biography of Case himself, is dedicated to how a bisexual teenager tries to tell about his relationship with homophobic parents.
Geletei pulls Ukraine in continuation of bloodshed
With the call to prepare for the next “tens of thousands” of victims, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Valeriy Geletei draws the people into the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
“In Moscow, of course, drew attention to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department, Valeriy Geletey, who said about the “completion of the operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the “Great Patriotic War”, in which the losses will be counted “tens of thousands”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published the mentioned post on his Facebook page, is a subject for the study of specialists not in the military field," the Russian diplomats said in a statement.
They hardly believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defense of the civilized state.
On his Facebook page, the defense minister of Ukraine wrote on Monday: "On unofficial channels, the Russian side has already threatened several times that if the resistance continues, they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us."
At the same time, he said that the “operation to liberate the east of Ukraine” was completed.

Today, horror has encompassed more than 60 Hollywood stars.
Hackers hacked primitive passwords in iCloud (data store) in smartphones, after which their intimate photos appeared on the site of blogger Perez Hilton.
True, not for long.

Tony Stewart Suffers an Accident After Returning to the Track
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended a little more than in the middle of the race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart crashed into the wall for the second time after his right front tire broke off at 172 laps, putting an end to his performance.
Stewart took his battered car to the garage and then left without talking to reporters.
His team leader Chad Johnston said 14 members of the team are upset, but will now focus on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish there was a better try and a better finish for him," Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond, and hopefully we'll get better.
Stewart first crashed into the wall earlier in the race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Bush, which required repairs to the right side of his car.
“I started today with a pretty big hope of making it to the finish line,” Johnston said, adding, “It just didn’t work out.”
Shortly after the second accident, Stewart's car was submerged in the evacuator, and the team gathered and was ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car crashed and killed another driver during a ground-race race in northern New York State.
He decided to come back this week, and he needed to win either in Atlanta or at the next races in Richmond to take part in the Pursuit.
He returned to work during an investigation into a tragic incident that resulted in the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr., who took to the track to express his displeasure with Stewart during the race.
Law enforcement officials said Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two more weeks.
The decision as to whether Stuart would be charged has not been made.
The three-time champion was met with loud cheers and applause when he was presented before the race.
Starting from the 12th position, Stuart went into the top 10 at the start of the race, reaching the fourth position.
Then 122 laps after restarting the Bush number.
The 18 came off the trajectory at the exit of turn 2 and crashed into Stuart, pushing both cars into the wall.
Stuart went on, but fell behind to 21st position.
Sobchak and Vitorgan have breakfast with Zhvanetsky in Odessa
Ksenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV presenter did not miss to report in her Instagram.
True, one photo was very surprising and very disturbing to the fans of the couple.
The photo was taken at Zhvanecki's.
"At breakfast, Mikhail Zhvanetsky's Maxim explains what Instagram is:)) #odessa", - signed a photo by Ksenia Sobchak.
However, there is nothing on the table except cigarettes.

During the peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to restore the old working conditions, which had recently been changed.
The salary increase is also included in the list of requirements that will be discussed with the acting Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
During the month, officers expressed symbolic protest against the new work schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.

The army controls the new government of Thailand
General Praut (right) appointed Minister of Defence Wongsuwan (left)
Thailand’s military ruler and prime minister, General Praut Chan-ocha, has announced the formation of a new cabinet of ministers in which more than a third of the country’s posts are held by retired generals or generals.
Representatives of the army were given key positions: ministers of defense, finance, foreign affairs and trade.
On Monday, Praut Chan-ocha was formally confirmed as prime minister after the King of Thailand officially approved the appointment of the interim military head of government.
The 60-year-old military man, who seized power in the country as a result of a bloodless coup on May 22, was the only candidate for prime minister.
He was elected prime minister at a session of parliament.
Earlier, the army appointed members of parliament.
According to Prayut Chan-ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations in which protesters demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinavat’s government.
Officially, Praut Chan-ocha will be the interim prime minister as the military plans to hold general elections in late 2015.
However, there are fears that the military is trying to strengthen its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22.
against the background of total paralysis of civil power.
The leaders of the main political parties were temporarily arrested.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country’s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglyk Chinawat.
Some journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army removed Brother Yinglyk Chinawat Taksin as prime minister.
Both of them are popular with the rural population, especially in the northern areas of the country, which has repeatedly ensured their success in the elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and the capital elite have joined the anti-government movement, which has virtually paralyzed the country since November 2013.
No one said that the mussel salad will be better, I did not promise you this, the waitress from the new Palm bracelet is cheating.
It has to be formally admitted that this is indeed the case, but the mind and stomach remain inflexible.
After all, everyone has known for a long time: we say "Belgium" - we mean midi, we say "midi" - we mean "Belgium".
Restaurants like to state in depth that the success of the institution depends on three factors: location, location and once again location.
There are such places, located not so well, and even excellent, but some unlucky.
In short, sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that once there was a cafe "Horodok" (in honor of the same TV show), then "Odessa-mama", and also a restaurant "Bojole" and a beer "Friendship".
Now here again beer, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Above the ground was only the tip of the iceberg: a bar and a couple of tables, the rest of the space is deprived even of hints of sunlight.
But here is fun, as in a children's room: red, yellow and green walls, colorful armchairs, instead of windows - TVs where mermaids swim.
Belgian establishments in St. Petersburg have long been out of the news, so compare it with what.
There are eight types of beer (260-300 rubles for 0.5 liters) and countless bottled (170-1550 rubles).
The company-positive waitress cheerfully presents the menu, telling that "the media are full of big seeds", and it should be noted: it is the service, despite some shortcomings, - the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in terms of content, but often very unexpected in terms of performance.
Who, for example, can predict that a meat roll with Walloon blackberry (280 rubles) - in fact, carpaccio, cut to the same fine that parchment paper in comparison with it will look ugly thick matter.
You can feel at least some taste, only if you step together half a plate.
Salads are even worse.
The classic Li<0xC3><0xA8>ge (260) would be most correct to recognize a crime against the Belgian people: some puffy iceberg, once boiled a long time ago potatoes, sprinkled Kenyan beans, clad chips of bacon plus why a marinade.
You wouldn't want to meet anyone with a salad like that!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partly different, but the impression was also not positive.
If it was still possible to close your eyes on the immature quarters of cherry tomatoes or overcooked mushrooms, then why do the mussels look as if they have been defrosted and boiled several times in their life!
After all, I already know that there are quite normal white sea mussels here!
They are served in sauces "in the sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
Sauces half a dozen, that of white wine, celery and carrots, frankly did not fit.
There are vegetables, and the aroma is absent, and whether there was wine, it remained a mystery.
But good friezes with homemade mayonnaise rely on mussels.
Chicken waffle here is not a snack so thick that depending on the mood you can decide the first or second dish in front of you, but just a nice creamy soup.
It was stated that the rabbit is a local cook cooking in beer sauce, and nothing was said about rosemary.
On the contrary, the situation turned out to be diametrically opposite: rosemary silenced everything.
There was the impression that this rabbit during his life was fed exclusively rosemary bushes, from which the meat acquired such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time, the leg of the rabbit was attached to a wonderful - no, just a fine pear in a caramelized crust.
Waffles in Palm offer not only sweet, but also filling - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
The maple sauce turned out to be too watery, and the waffles dried.
But the manager who came to the table was very informally interested in lunch impressions.
So, you should come again.
The exchange rate of the dollar rose above 37 rubles on the news about new sanctions being prepared by the West against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar "tomorrow" by 10:29 MSK grew by 26.9 kopecks and was 37.02 rubles, the euro rose by 30 kopecks - to 48.73 rubles, according to data of the Moscow Stock Exchange.
The bi-currency basket grew by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached a maximum on February 19, 2009 - then it cost 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014, it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House said U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is of a long-term nature, both in pairs with the euro, and in pairs with the dollar.
The long-term forecast assumed this mark, - says senior analyst "Alpari" Anna Bodrov.
Everything that has to do with Ukraine will somehow be reflected in the courses.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumors about the invasion of troops are not confirmed by either side, but the market turned out to be very emotional.
All talk that he was resistant to such news was overruled yesterday.
The week, according to the expert, will close around these levels - 36.90 and 37.05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period is over, oil prices are weak, policies, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine are all links of one chain.
Inflation is also forecast to accelerate: the current prices for autumn will increase from 5 to 10%.
Soon, in addition, seasonal vegetables and fruits will run out, and there will be some vacuum, while the networks are reoriented to other suppliers.
"Dollar came to the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and returned back, there is no such thing as a powerful hysteria," commented Konstantin Bushuev, head of the market analysis department of "Opening Broker".
They will still be watching to see if they will introduce the promised sanctions on Saturday, as NATO will sit.
According to him, the ruble sharply weakened after the end of the tax season, then went to the news on Ukraine, in addition, the Central Bank last week said that by the end of the year it is completely moving to the floating rate and refuses any foreign exchange interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, then it was no different from the previous during this month, everyone was frightened by the mark of 37 rubles, - continues the analyst.
And so, in terms of turnover, nothing powerful happened.
Alarming times for the foreign exchange market were, I recall, at the end of January there was increased demand for the currency, as well as on the third of March, when the Central Bank shipped a record amount of currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the ruble weakening.
First of all, this is the growth of the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as increasing the competitiveness of domestic producers due to import prices, says the chief analyst of UFS IC Alexey Kozlov.
Negative points can be attributed to the increase in the price of imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressure and, as a result, cause the cost of borrowing money, which in turn slows down the development of the country’s economy.
If we talk about the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat smooths the decrease in the prices of shares, expressed in rubles.
For example, the MIA index fell by 1.67% during Thursday’s bidding, and the RTS index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative magnitude of the decline in indices is due to the weakening of the ruble during the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional and is explained by the mass desire to buy the currency.
As practice shows, gradually emotions go to zero, and the ruble quotes partially or completely restore the lost positions.
"We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency close to the level of 36 rubles per dollar," - said Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed.
The British woman said she had spent many years thinking she would die after being misdiagnosed.
Karen Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking she had only a few years left to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charcot-Marie-Tuta disease (SMT), a group of inherited disorders that lead to nerve damage outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK reported that a misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with STDs because so little is known about the condition.
About 23,000 people in the UK are thought to have a STI that can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, insecure gait and pinched toes.
Patients may feel numbness or pain, and the condition does not heal and progresses, which means that symptoms worsen over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich's ataxia (AF), a condition for which the prognosis was very poor.
Rogers thought she would be confined to a wheelchair by the time she turned 18, and would die before she turned 30.
The mother of two, who is now 51, said: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do what others could.
I fell every day, and I spent more time on everything.
I’ve never been able to ride rollerblades or skateboard with other kids, and I’ve been bullied a lot at school because of how I’ve been walking and running.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several surgeries to release Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked at the medical card when her doctor came out of the room, and it was written that she had AF.
“I felt guilty because I stuck my nose where I shouldn’t and so I didn’t tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this state in the library and wrote to the AF Association,” she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and panicked as much as possible.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die before I turned 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in the meantime.
I went through this alone, and I planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she turned 17, she realized that her walking ability had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just got up, hugged me and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this disease because you'd already be in a wheelchair."
I think you have something that poses a much smaller threat to your life.
After a few genetic tests, she was found to have an STD.
“When he explained what a SMT was, I thought I had pulled out a lucky ticket,” she said.
The UK’s SMT charity has announced a month of information about SMT to try to draw attention to this disease.
The tax burden on Washington-area entrepreneurs is on the rise as the economy recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
This also means higher taxes.
Accounts for state and local taxes for companies across the country rose moderately last year as the recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington area are no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid out $27.6 billion in state and local cash in fiscal 2013, up 3.8 percent from the $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden on business by state and local level increased by 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after the year-over-year declines in 2009 and 2010.
Taxes charged by the state grew faster, 4.3 percent than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by professional services firm Ernst & Young and the State Taxation Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county’s tax revenue, 56 percent, is corporate income tax, while 36 percent of Maryland’s tax revenue is corporate income.
Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the lowest amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
To a large extent, the rise in tax revenues is caused by a return to the previous level of real estate value of companies, the researchers say, which raised real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three years in a row, when growth was less than 1 percent.
While much of this revenue comes from large states such as California, New York, and Texas, it seems the same is happening in the Washington area.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia collectively paid $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012, up 4.2 percent from the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate value has no similar effect on the growth of state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property taxes barely exceed one-fifth of companies’ tax bills.
Companies in Virginia and the District of Columbia pay about half of their state and local tax bills in the form of property taxes.
“What’s happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, belongs to either the government or a non-profit organization that doesn’t pay property taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center for State Taxation.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more on, for example, income taxes to pay for the same services that exist in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the recovery of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurs’ incomes also seem to be going up, according to these data.
Companies in the region have declared a state-level corporate income tax of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion in corporate income tax revenue, the most in the region.
While trends are moving in one direction, the tax burden on entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three areas.
The growth rate in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the national average of 4.3 per cent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, at 4.9 per cent.
Only in Virginia, there was a rise in tax revenues below the average of 4.1 percent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax in three jurisdictions (each with the same corporate rate), equal to 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while in the county it is relatively high at 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that in Virginia, taxes for entrepreneurs are lower by state and local level and, overall, a more favorable climate in terms of taxes for entrepreneurs than in Maryland.
The county was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is under competitive pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina recently signed legislation that reduced the corporate rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, as in Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its tax revenue targets next year, this law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs to as high as 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be feeling better and thus paying more taxes by state and local level, according to a recent study.
Taxes for entrepreneurs paid in the form of an individual income tax by small business owners - the transitional structure on which most of the small firms - in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia grew by 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, with a much higher rate of growth than the previous year.
The researchers say the trend and increase in business tax revenues across the country are likely to continue this year, with revenue from state and local government turnover tax revenues rising 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington area may lag behind, as a reduction in federal spending affects the labor market in the region.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The domestic judo world championship brought two silver and seven bronze awards to the Russian national team.
According to this indicator, the Russians gave up only the main favorite of the competition - the national team of Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who performed in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in an equal final fight with Boldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation decided only one remark received by the Russian.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian team - on Tuesday, three medals were won immediately.
In men's competitions in the category up to 66 kg of silver was won by Mikhail Pulyaev, and bronze by Kamal Khan-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russian conceded to the 2011 and 2013 world champions Masasi Ebinume of Japan.
Khan-Magomedov, in the quarter-final stage, who lost to his compatriot, won the consolation tournament and became the winner of the bronze award.
In the women's tournament of the category up to 52 kg also to the third step of the pedestal of honor Natalia Kuzutinina got.
In the semi-finals, she lost to current world champion Maylinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who played under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
In the bronze dispute, Kuzutinin won from Ma Inan from China, but after the tournament ended, she admitted that third place is not what she expected.
And once again the obstacle on the way of the Russian to gold was Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzutin earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk bronze in the kick of the Russian team put Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category up to 73 kg.
In the quarterfinals, his offender was former Moldovan representative Viktor Skovortsov, who now stands for the UAE team.
However, then the Russian won two fights and became the winner of the award.
Mogushkov performed at the home championship with a sledgehammer injury, which he plans to cure in the near future, so he will take a break in competitions.
As for the ex-Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he reached the bronze medal in this tournament.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots, who took UAE sports citizenship, Ivan Remarenko with bronze finished the performance in the category up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought the Russians one bronze, which in the category up to 81 kg won Ivan Nifontov.
In the heavy battle of the small final, he defeated the Frenchman Alan Schmitt by a remark from the opponent.
On Friday, three sets of awards were played at once at the tournament, but the Russians traditionally limited themselves to one bronze in the men's tournament up to 90 kg.
It was won by Kirill Voprosov, and the Russian national team was guaranteed this medal: his opponent in the consolation final was the compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the fight itself did not take place: the opponent Question was not able to get on the tatami due to the injury.
The men's bronze was won by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - it was put in the kick of the team by Renat Saidov, who was in the category over 100 kg.
In the consolation final, he won a clean victory over Brazilian David Moura.
Thus ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of the world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian national teams - both men's and women's - were among the main contenders for the awards, but, as in individual competitions, the representatives of the fair sex were not lucky - they did not reach the medal.
But the Russian judoists won the team silver.
In a decisive confrontation, they in a persistent fight with a score of 2-3 gave up to the main favorites of the competition - the team of Japan.
At the same time, the Russian team led 2-0 after a clean victory of Khan-Magomedov and a free-kick - Denis Yartseva (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in the heavier weight categories with their Japanese rivals, Murat Khabachirov (81), Magomed Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiev (100).
The same scenario developed a bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian team, leading 2-0, conceded to the Japanese - 2-3.
The team competitions in Chelyabinsk were attended by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who after the tournament congratulated the men's team with silver.
"Second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was clear that you could become champions," Putin said, quoted by RIA Novosti.
To lose to the Japanese, to the natives of judo - there is nothing blasphemous here.
But I'm sure you can win with them.
The Russian national team at the world championships performed much better than a year ago at competitions of this level, held in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, the Russian team had only three medals – one silver and two bronze.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by Olympic champions Arsen Galstyan and Mansur Isayev.
We are all, of course, great maximalists.
Yes, I want gold medals.
But let us remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is among the eight strongest, then he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in the form of sports such as judo," - summed up the results of the tournament Russian Minister of Sport Vitaly Mutko, whose words are quoted by the press service of the championship.
Japan's national team is expected to be the best in Chelyabinsk, winning 11 medals of different merit, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Cup will be held next summer in Astana.

The Joan Rivers family hopes for the best.
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since arriving at a hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the disease.
“Thank you for your continued love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call that she had a cardiac arrest at a clinic in the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, sources say.
Doctors deliberately keep her under anesthesia and under strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains “heavy.”
The response was broad, including numerous online support from such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Everyone can be kings.
Royal Blood's debut album is a new hope for British rock, bringing rock duos from the clubs directly to the stadiums.
The Royal Blood duo has been on stage all year, but already has an active nomination for the BBC Music Award, a tour to warm up at the Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the New York City gig make-up artist from Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album of the same name received 100,000 pre-orders a few months before its release, and the contract for its release is in the portfolio of the major label Warner Music.
Given the current sad situation in the music market, the situation is emerging from a number of outs, because it is not about the new Lana Del Rey or another sweet-voiced representative of the "new R'n'B", and about a duet of bulls in the form of Britons playing with that level of loudness and last instinct.
In general, the stakes on the first album due to all the above circumstances were particularly high and already quite justified.
The duet took on a name that had previously been used by nothing but desperate hairy metallers, and the blood of which kings flows, it seems to them, in their veins, is also clear.
We are talking, of course, first of all about the heroes of the past level Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood aim to shake the blood of British rock, bringing it to a new height.
To make predictions about the success of this enterprise is perhaps early, but something can already be said.
A dozen songs in their thirties with little minutes is not so much a demonstration of a phenomenal composer’s gift as a confident and powerful declaration of intent.
Some of the merits of individual numbers, of course, can not be denied: for example, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by what is remembered not by the melodic line, but by the drumming.
The musicians jokingly say that this song is generally easier to tap than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing track of the song "Better Strangers" with a Shakespearean quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a party of heavy rock fans, but when played in a row they merge into more or less homogeneous canvas.
And it’s not necessarily bad, even the other way around.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they don't claim the new Lennon and McCartney laurels (rather, they're aiming at Mot<0xC3><0xB6>rhead's successors), but have pulled numerous rock duos out of the ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite some variety, is created for stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousand people, it is obviously tight.
The secret is partly in the clever use of the bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format, invented at the beginning of the zeros The White Stripes.
However, it is not only in the instruments, but also in the approach to the composition of songs.
The heroes of the zero retrorock were very hard to choose outside of the postmodernist paradigm, with great reluctance to recognize themselves not just as epigones, but as independent creative units.
Royal Blood already sounds so powerful and sluggish that this effort successfully drapes some secondaryness and solidity of the musical material.
After all, who said rock should be smart?
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported on Friday morning: An online store — and a video producer, and hundreds of other things — is buying streaming video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($US970 million).
This news came as a surprise not because no one expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service for a good billion dollars looked completely ready, and such a combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, has set the goal of being a streaming service of a general nature – a real-time version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly turned into a platform where gamers streamed their in-game moments; “YouTube for real-time games,” according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos in which omniscience gives (mostly, old) games processing, as in "Mystery Theater", are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube acquires Twitch has been met with little interest, a classic example of a entrenched technology company buying out a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube failed, given that it was reportedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.
All we have at the moment is a statement from Twitch CEO Emmet Shire: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us achieve them faster.”
Another secret, to be honest, is the incredible success of Twitch.
Snobs like me, who say they’re better at sports than watching, find it hard to understand the appeal of watching games instead of taking joysticks into one’s own hands.
It’s one thing to look through a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. when she crawls through Resident Evil, and quite another to watch some stranger get 20 shots in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you could watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them shoot without controlling the angle of view on your own can be a headache recipe worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the high-speed passes in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronic age complete entire games in record time are entertaining.
But if it’s not about the game’s virtuoso or humor, it’s unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors per month, and it is the fourth-largest source of peak Internet traffic.
How is Amazon going to make money from this?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch will turn to Amazon Instant Video as gracefully as YouTube could just swallow Twitch.
However, Twitch has something that any company would be happy to get: the crowds of young men that advertisers dream of.
As the head of Twitch Shire said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of games", and this channel does not show signs of repudiation, even - oh - as a spectacular sport.
The 2004 terrorist attack killed more than 330 people, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were injured.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
We talked to the surviving hostages - almost all now students, with the parents of the deceased, with the caretaker of the cemetery - City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, head of the committee "Mother Beslan" Susanna Dudiyeva, who took part in the special operation of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, - says the correspondent of the department "Yebshet"
Already returning to Moscow, they met with Aslambek Aslakhanov, who 10 years ago was an adviser to the president on the North Caucasus and conducted negotiations with terrorists, as well as with the officer of the “B” FSB of Russia Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What particularly shocked me during the work on this topic is that Beslan was not like these ten years.
This topic is extremely painful for everyone who has at least some relation to it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
Impressions from the trip are very heavy.
But we cannot forget Beslan, and I hope we have done our job,” Antonov said.
The special project was prepared by the infographics studio of Rambler & Co, which has been working in the company since the spring of this year.
The previous special projects were devoted to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin’s stay in power.
North Korea has launched a short-range missile
North Korea has launched a short-range missile into the waters of the Japanese Sea, Renhap reports.
The launch was made around 10.30 a.m. local time by Chagando province, on the border of North Korea and China.
The missile allegedly fell into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 km, the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea said.
The deputies proposed to accelerate the entry into force of the law on personal data
If the initiative is successful, the data of Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015.
The State Duma has introduced a draft law providing for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is based on the legislative activities of the lower house.
Its authors were the deputies of the State Duma Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Evgeny Fedorov ("United Russia"), Vladimir Parakhin ("Just Russia") and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to a more rapid and effective protection of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the preservation of personal data and the observance of the secrecy of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
The law, the entry into force of which parliamentarians are in a hurry, obliges to store on the territory of the Russian Federation personal data of Russians processed through the Internet.
It also makes it mandatory to record, systematize, accumulate, store, refine and extract personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located on the territory of Russia, as well as to indicate the location of such databases.
In addition, the law gives Roskomnadzor the right, on the basis of a court decision, to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of so-called “blacklists” of offending websites – an automated information system “Register of violators of the rights of personal data subjects”.
This law was passed by the state Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugovoy and Vadim Dengin from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the CPRF.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current draft law on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in Russia, will have to pay for the rent
Commenting on the bill introduced today in the State Duma, the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy Leonid Levin said that he does not see any problems in transferring the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own stores of personal data of Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, "from Rostelecom", which has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers for rent and already provides their servers, from Mail Group, their servers.
“In addition, there are several independent data centers ready to cooperate in this area,” he added.
“If the companies decide to comply with the law and continue to work on the territory of the Russian Federation, I see no problems – they will get technological opportunities for accommodation,” Levin said.
Controversial Bill
Immediately after the publication of the draft law, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed concern that if the bill is passed, Russians will no longer be able to use many global Internet services.
In particular, we are talking about online booking services of airline tickets and hotels.
According to the association, "the draft law deprives subjects of personal data - citizens of the Russian Federation the right to dispose of their own data imperatively determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located in the territory of the Russian Federation."
The statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be to create a mechanism to inform the user about where the recording is carried out, systematization of his personal data.
In this case, you will be able to choose in which territory these actions will be carried out.
The adoption of similar laws on the “localization” of personal data in other countries has led to the loss of global services and significant economic losses.

Militants handed over more than 400 prisoners to the Ukrainian military
The “Army of Novorossiya” claims to have shot down the Ukrainian Su-27, and accuses the enemy of violating the cease-fire agreement
As of 10:00 a.m. on 1 September, the militias handed over 402 prisoners, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 dead military personnel to the Ukrainian side.
This was reported to Interfax by a representative of the press service of the Army of Novorossiya.
He added that "the air defense forces in the area of the village of Mereshki shot down the Su-27 aircraft, which violated the ceasefire agreement."
According to the interlocutor of the agency, the Ukrainian side in the artillery shelling of the Luhansk airport used cluster munitions prohibited by international conventions.
A spokesman for the press service noted that the militias managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force at one of the field airfields, as well as destroy two armored personnel carriers and two ammunition depots.
"The loss of life of the enemy - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, surrendered in captivity 13 people," - summed up the representative of the headquarters.
Interfax does not have confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the "people's republics" of Donbass announced the transfer to the Ukrainian side within the framework of compliance with the ceasefire regime of 223 prisoners of war and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine.
At the same time, at night, the DPR army, according to the "Army of Novorossiysk", "overruled the attempt of the National Guards in violation of the previously reached agreements to remove heavy equipment from the area of the environment."
The militia then reported the destruction of two tanks and two BMPs, the capture of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 servicemen in the short-term battle.
According to the headquarters, total enemy losses in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol) that night amounted to five tanks, eight armored vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers found themselves surrounded by militias in the Ilovaisk district of the Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the leadership of the "people's republics" to release Ukrainian troops from the environment.
In the DPR agreed to go for it, provided the enemy surrenders weapons and ammunition.
The first dozens of servicemen began to leave the surrounding settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the battalion of the Ukrainian territorial defense "Donbass" Semyon Semenchenko, 14 more people came out of the "boiler" on Sunday night.
In his Facebook post, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are “captured by 137 regiments of the 32nd Russian Division and 9th Russian Tank Brigade”, where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Foreign Ministry and the Russian Defense Ministry have denied reports of the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will retaliate if EU imposes new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions, the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the “conclusions” of the European Council of August 30 demonstrated the inability of the EU member states to overcome the inertia of their reckless support of the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, based on "absolutely unproven allegations about the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country," the ministry's website said.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full “dialogue between the opposing sides”, the ministry stressed.
The ministry’s website also notes that there are currently no objective estimates of the humanitarian situation in the Donbas, where a full-scale humanitarian disaster has unfolded, and the number of victims among the civilian population is growing.
We remind that within the next seven days in the European Union it is planned to develop concrete proposals for sanctions against the Russian Federation.
At the same time, the representatives of the EU are working closely with American officials.
It is assumed that they will correlate the measures introduced with each other by the period of action and the degree of rigidity.
The new EU sanctions could affect the energy and financial sectors.
The Australian government has also announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the fields of defense, finance and oil and gas industry.
Smart Ways to Save on University Textbooks
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who will soon move on to the second course, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books from high school students, offering them nominal compensation so that they would postpone their sale.
“My math textbook, which usually costs $180, I got a $10 semester and a Chick-fil-A cookie,” says Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature for last semester would have cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, the average student spends more than $1,200 per year on textbooks and study supplies, but students have a number of options to reduce these costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online stores and creative ideas similar to Schr<0xC3><0xB6>der’s system.
Book rentals are becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use the book during the semester, and often cost significantly less than buying them.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that the volume of book rental has doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of books in university bookstores during the past spring semester have been rented out, says Nibo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the professional association "National Association of University Stores".
Here is an introductory course on the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Purchase in the online store
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one-third of what you’ll see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of The Mathematical Analysis of Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards, and Robert Hostetler costs about $290 per price tag, but a new copy can be purchased for $239.99 at Chegg.com, which specializes in textbook sales.
Purchase of used
If you are not against other people’s marks or injuries, used textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is sold for $93.49 as used on Chegg.com.
Matt Cassadey, 25, a fourth-year student at Brigham Young University, says he paid Amazon.com 42 cents for a copy of the book “Strategic Solutions in Media: Understanding the Business Side of Advertising.”
The book sold for $48.
Teachers, for example, Ingrid Bracy, director of the College Without Walls at the University of Massachusetts at Emherst, offers students to clarify with their professors whether they can use previous editions.
Updates are sometimes not necessary for classes.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small fraction of the cost of the last edition.
In addition to the Chegg and Amazon sites, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying used books.
Rent-a-car
About taking the textbooks for rent, it is worth thinking, if you treat them well enough, do not forget to return them and do not want to leave them to yourself after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent Mathematical Analysis for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you pick up books, including any fines that you may be charged for markings, underlining, and damage.
If you take the book for rent, remember: if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of the new copy.
E-books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented out by acquiring an electronic license for a certain period of time from distributors, such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
“Mathematical Analysis” on Chegg.com for six months will cost about $61.
Bracey says that students studying literature can often find the most affordable prices, as many classic works can now be downloaded for free, while natural and engineering literature can be quite expensive.
Whatever it is, check it out.
Joe Golt, 29, who is about to start studying at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using an ISBN number to figure out the price of a book, as this ensures that you are looking for the right text for you.
Before you place an order online, Golt says, be sure to check if the book is actually in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he purchased was delayed for four weeks, and he eventually paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin said about the total inefficiency of the development fund of the Far East
Russian President Vladimir Putin said at a meeting on state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective, reports Interfax.
“15 billion rubles remain on the deposits,” the president stressed.
During the meeting, the Head of State instructed to expedite the approval of the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East.
He recalled that the draft law necessary for the creation of TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the President noted, until July 1 never approved the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East, and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks for ensuring the development of the Far East.
Among them, increasing the transport accessibility of the region, removing infrastructure restrictions - both on the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create the prerequisites for attracting additional investments into the region, as well as to form territories of advanced development, which should become competitive with the key business centers of the ATR, the President stressed.
Recall that it was previously reported that the territory of advanced development can replace the EEZ.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy Couldn't Save Cash
Sylvester Stallone’s “Unstoppable 3” returned less than $30 million from its $90 million U.S. budget, while “City of Sins: The Woman Worth Killing For” returned only $12 million from its $70 million U.S. budget.
"Home video" with Cameron Diaz brought only $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's films such as "How to tame the dragon 2" also disappoint revenue.
The Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin's article points out that when it comes to children's films, it may be a matter of poor quality of the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year in history in terms of children's movies, and called "How to tame the dragon 2" a barely "functional" continuation of fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem does not necessarily lie in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average ratings of CinemaScore and Metacritic for each film released in the summer in the amount of at least 2,000 copies between the Memorial Day holiday in May and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both film-goers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film harvest is similar in caliber to last year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that this may be due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of streaming internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favreau, who is currently working on the soon-to-be-released Disney film Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We must recognize this and not try to chase after what was before.
In contrast to the current fall in cash fees in Hollywood, Netflix’s streaming revenue has reached $1.2 billion, almost double last year’s figure of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too heavily on comic book franchises, and predicted Hollywood’s “fall.”
In light of the current downturn, some commentators claim that in his gloomy predictions there was a share of the truth.
Due to the fact that in the summer of 2015 it is expected to release several potential box office hits, including “Avengers: Age of Altron”, “Minionov” and “Yursky Park”, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
Simon Kinberg, producer of The X-Men, recently called the drop in box office fees simply “cyclical,” told the Hollywood Reporter: “Next summer will be the most box office summer in history, and no one will worry about it.”
Product sanctions do not scare the owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants of European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
In general, the general public prefers to replace the prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
“It’s better to eat a low-salt cucumber than a bad mozzarella,” says Barlotti’s chef Mariano Valerio about the quality of cheeses offered by Italian suppliers.
Mozzarella and burrata cheese ended up in the restaurant first, they have a short shelf life.
Stocks of parmesan should be enough for another couple of months.
What to do?
Moving to Russian?
In 2005 I was at the Dorogomilovsky market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear: shocking memories do not let him go yet.
The meat was lying there on the carts only 30 centimeters from the floor!
There are cats!
Rats!
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe it's changed now.
But the other day, they brought me fish from the Far East for a test.
So she turned out to be dead!
I said I didn't even want to talk to the person who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many common things for Italy for the Russian manufacturer in the wild.
A few years ago, I had to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, the meat is hung in a refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It needs to hang out to become soft so that the muscles relax.
I did all this with the local beef.
Then they asked me, “Where did you get that tender meat?”
I said, "It's yours, Russian!"
Why doesn't anyone do that to you?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Most" in the kitchen hangs a stop-list, which indicates the missing products: French oysters, sea urchins.
The chef of the Brasserie Most restaurant and the Bar Strelka is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already been replaced by oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss ones.
However, and Regis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Colored cabbage - 200 rubles!
I ask, "Why, on what basis is it worth so much?"
They tell me, "Well, we have to make money, too."
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
Far Eastern oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15-20 years, can you imagine how much their shell weighs?
At the price it turns out that it is a superdelicacy.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of scarecrows for foreign cooks.
Standard story: “The first three months were all good, then the quality fell sharply.”
The main claims: Russian suppliers can not withstand stable calibre and quality.
Many European restaurants don’t know what will happen to them when they run out of cheese.

The sanction menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are mainly called food sanctions.
It is forbidden to import beef, pork, meat and by-products from poultry, meat delicacies, fish, shellfish, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, cheese, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants have started a charade with suppliers: prices for products have risen, you need to urgently look for analogues from other countries.
The strongest this will affect the expensive restaurants with mono-kitchen France, Italy, Spain, to which the products were delivered directly from the "mother" countries.
The commonwealth had to be rebuilt before.
For example, in early 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In return, suppliers set up deliveries of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the summer 2014 sanctions turned out to be much more serious.
True, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which outlaw the ban of Atlantic salmon and trout, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peas and onions for planting.
Valerio, an Italian, hopes the sanctions will ease further.
So far, some of the restaurants are in a state of uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of the largest suppliers of HoReCa, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
“Expensive restaurants will have to change the menu for what are produced by local farmers and other countries,” says Sergey Mironov, restaurateur, owner of the agency “Resconsult”.
If the chef is strong, it will not be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such chefs, and it can take two or three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from the restaurant "Brasserie Most" is ready for this: you will have to give up 10-15% of dishes, another half of the menu - to recycle.
Restaurants with mixed cuisine are already starting to replace dishes, for example, steak from marble beef - on befstroganov, says Sergey Mironov.
“The cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile,” Oksana Glibchuk, a representative of East-West company, said.
Creams and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the USA can be replaced with chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and semolina from Norway - salmon, semolina, trout from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of vegetables and fruits of European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, offerings from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, budget network restaurants will be easier to rebuild than the premium segment: it is unlikely that gourmets who were able to distinguish Italian mozzarella from Russian ones went there.
The Ginza Project, he believes, will have a hard time.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
A lot of time will pass in return," Mironov said.
Ginza declined to comment, citing a lack of owners in the country.
Cafe owners of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that products from the former Soviet republics are more aromatic than European ones.
But there are a lot of restaurants that will not be affected by the sanctions.
These include establishments with CIS cuisine: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
“There are no expensive foods in Georgian cuisine,” says Hatuna Kolbaya, the owner of Georgian restaurant Saperavi and cafe “Wai Me!”.
All cheeses for us are made in Russia, the basis of many dishes - chicken fillet, exotic greens we do not use."
At the Kolbai restaurants, not a single dish has been removed from the menu yet.
Timur Lansky, the owner of the restaurants "Chikhona N1" with Uzbek cuisine, sanctions also do not bother: he will have to change only lamb to New Zealand.
If Russia imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in the price, it will be cheaper for us than imports from Europe,” he says.
From the CIS it is cheaper to get a cut, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits.
At the same time, what they bring from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
About Uzbek tomatoes, everyone knows that they are delicious, sweet.
No one speaks Spanish like that.
After the imposition of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan, Olimboy Artykov, said that he plans to increase the export of fruit products to Russia by half by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports to Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Fast food restaurants, which responded to the request "Money", also quite calmly react to the sanctions.
McDonald’s said that the localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatiana Bogdanova, head of the department for working with suppliers of Subway Russia, about 80% of products the network purchases in Russia, although there may be temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and the increase in the prices of meat products that are produced from imported raw materials.
In Teremka, “sanctioned products” occupied no more than 4%.
They didn't touch the sanctions and the Walker.
KFC, Burger King and Little Potato didn’t respond to the request, but other market participants claim that Burger King’s localization rate is significantly lower than that of McDonald’s.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are ready to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far Eastern fish.
On his hump
Meanwhile, restaurants are complaining that due to the increase in demand, prices are rising even for local products.
“For products for Grabley, prices increased by an average of 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant “Cherry Mio” – twice,” says the restaurateur Roman Rozhnivsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of dishes will increase by 5-10%, Kolbaya admits.
East-West does not deny this: “For example, Belarusian dairy products have risen by 10-15% since the beginning of August.”
“Brazilian suppliers have raised the price of pork almost twice,” complains Sergey Rak, deputy director general of Stardogs.
The chickens were up 35 percent.
We are waiting for prices from China, maybe they will cool the hot Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned price increase of 8%.
“It’s very undesirable to raise prices now,” says Cancer.
According to statistics, the growth of total food revenue for the second quarter of 2014 - only 1.8%.
This is the lowest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he admits, but it is unclear how quickly: while most restaurateurs have stocked up on products for the next two months in the hope of anticipating buying-in price swings.
What will happen in two months, no one knows.
In the square in front of the Moscow City Hall stands a dozen tents decorated with greenery and wood.
In the center of the scene, musicians play waltzes.
It’s a regional food festival with the fun title “There’s Time to Eat.”
"We were going to make a celebration of local food for a long time, and here are the sanctions, we rushed, organized a festival," - says one of the organizers.
Behind the stage with the musicians, Greek chef Anastas prepares a salad of pasta and homemade sweets, the other day there was a master class on the preparation of borscht with caramelized apples.
All of the Russian products, the organizers assure.
In tents - an exhibition of achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, reindeer from Salehard, vegetables from the sub-Moscow "Sovkhoz name of Lenin", cheeses from the scalded Italian Jay Clouse.
“Salmon for restaurants can be easily replaced by another fish of salmon breeds from the Far East,” says the owner of the fish shop “Your people” Philip Galkin.
We've got a kidney, a ket, a chin, a hump, a scabbard, a "royal salmon."
Yes, they are not as fat as Norwegian salmon, because it is a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is a kind of aquaculture.
You take it in your hand, it doesn't even move.
And you won't hold our Far Eastern salmon in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian mozzarella with the domestic mozzarella
In the showcase of his tent lie shrimp with the tag "Magadan", cod, mol, muxun, midi from Crimea, combs from the Far East.
Galkin is sure that it is time to switch to fish from the Far East.
According to statistics, fishing in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Import of fish in 2013 - about 800 thousand tons.
The store "Your people" has been operating since 2012, selling fish through an online store, before the imposition of sanctions served another one and a half dozen restaurants, for example, "Simple things".
Now Galkin received applications from 15 more restaurants.
The same sushi can be made from our fish, - it is hot.
We got cold, tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through an online store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is cheaper several times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
As a confirmation in Galkin's tent, I'm getting a portion of Philadelphia with a keta.
Unlike rolls with semolina, these have to chew longer, but the awareness that this fish is ours, domestic, gives strength.
On the website of the shop "Your people" there are even rolls of palatus and sea urchin.
In sushi bars, however, to replace Norwegian salmon is preferred to Chilean.
Galkin explains this by the fact that lazy cooks come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
“Russian fish suppliers have not offered us yet,” – explains the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitry Evseev.
About the same situation with other products: Russian manufacturers could occupy the liberated niche, but this does not happen.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project, Boris Akimov, we can now talk about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations, which have powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace prohibited imports in contrast to our farmers.
That is, from the ban will benefit, first of all, large producers of other countries," - says Akimov.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than food sanctions.
Following the mass unplanned inspections of Rospotrebnadzor, the activities of three McDonald’s enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg were temporarily suspended.
“We are examining the merits of the claims made to determine the actions necessary for the early opening of restaurants for visitors,” McDonald’s said in a statement.
In fact, no one knows what will happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be experienced, - says on conditions of anonymity an employee of the company engaged in restaurant consulting.
If McDonald’s were to close across the country, the scenario would be completely different.
"Europrotocol" instead of reference to the BIBDD
Cash payments can be obtained without a certificate from the BIBDD – so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the implementation of the “Europrotocol” in Russia.
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft of guidelines according to which from September 1 this year, an insured motorist will be able to do without a certificate of BIBDD to receive cash payments.
The issue, however, is only those cases where the accident was registered under the “Europrotocol” without the participation of the road police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in the accident, there are no physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the set limit and both drivers have reached an agreement on who is responsible for the accident.
From August 2, the limit of payments under the "Europrotocol" is 50 thousand rubles, and from October 1, in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions, it will be increased to 400 thousand rubles.
The bottom line is that often, even in minor injuries, in a situation where an accident can be registered under the “Europrotocol”, drivers who are in an accident cause an accident.
After all, if there is a policy helmet to get a refund on it without a certificate of the BIBDD was not possible.
The parameters prescribed in the draft directive are precisely designed to eliminate this obstacle on the way to the implementation of the “Europrotocol” in Russia.
According to them, the maximum cash payment in connection with the accident, issued without the staff of the BIDD, should not be lower than the limit under the "Europrotocol".
But at the same time, it can not be above the limit set in the insurance contract Casco.
The idea is certainly useful and theoretically able to unload both DPS employees and the road.
But, most likely, it will not delight neither motorists nor insurers.
The latter are already talking about a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which may lead to the introduction of new rules for cash payments.
As for the drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
In most cases, the driver will wait for hours for the inspector to arrange a minor accident, because it is so reliable.
And it is not yet known what will be easier - to defeat fraudsters or convince drivers of the reliability of the "Europrotocol".
The saving certificate will make the name and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban savings certificates on the bearer, but will allow banks to make them an analogue of irrevocable deposit.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will prohibit savings certificates on the bearer.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, as the rates here are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that the savings certificates for the depositor do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and the bank they are cheaper, since it is not necessary to make deductions to the Fund of the Deposit Insurance Agency (PAA).
The plight of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates, and Sberbank and Bank of Moscow will suffer from it, which, according to ASV estimates, control 98% of the profile market.
And the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to the agency, is about 3.5%.
The problem, explained in ASV, is that the customers of a small bank that bought such a certificate, in case of withdrawal from it, the licenses are trying to get money in ASV.
Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates on the bearer, may assume that their investments are insured.
The justified lack of insurance payments on these certificates in case of revocation of the license from the bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency there were cases when the holders of presentation certificates tried to collect insurance compensation through the court,” – said in the ASV.
The problem, of course, is imaginary.
After all, no one will pay buyers of certificates anyway, because they do not have the right by law to reimbursement from the state.
If the issue was that the instrument was not insured in ASV, it would also prohibit metal accounts, in which the citizens' funds are accounted for in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the system of deposit insurance, but their existence is not attempted.
The thing, most likely, is that the certificates on the bearer are a very convenient security, which can actually act as a quasi-deneg.
At the same time, their movement is virtually uncontrollable: any customer of the bank can buy a certificate, transfer it to any citizen, and before cashing such a certificate can change many owners.
It is no accident that the draft law stipulates that a savings certificate must be an exact security, which must be stored in the depository.
And to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to be issued without the right of early repayment.
That is, an analogue of the irrevocable contribution that bankers have long dreamed of.
NATO summit: First protests in Newport and Cardiff
Protests were held over the weekend by those who opposed the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for a march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff about 150 people gathered at Cardiff City Hall for what was described as an anti-summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments over the weekend for us and spoke to the protesters who came from all over: from Bridgend to Belgium.
Germany to send 30 anti-tank complexes to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter militants from the Islamic State terrorist group, ITAR-TASS reported on August 31, citing a decision taken following a meeting of representatives of the German government led by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Germany will reportedly send 30 Milan portable anti-tank missile systems and 500 charges to Iraq, as well as 8,000 G3 and G36 assault rifles.
Deliveries will be made by the end of September.
In addition, it was decided to allocate another 50 million euros to Iraq for humanitarian assistance.
On 1 September, Ms. Merkel will speak in the Bundestag with a government statement on the subject.
So far, Germany has not supplied its weapons to “hotspots”.
Opinions of the inhabitants of Germany on the sending of weapons to the Iraqis were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop fighters from the Islamic State, others fear that this weapon may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Militants hit Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militias hit a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, reports ITAR-TASS on August 31.
According to the available data, this happened in Taganrog Bay near the settlements of Shirokino and Bezymennoye (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reports about the shelling of two boats of the coast guard.
It is specified that the incident occurred today at about 16:20 Moscow time.
Teenagers were taken on a helicopter from the Blue Mountains
Two teenage bushhawks were taken by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old young man set out on a field trip shortly after noon on Sunday at Govetts Lipp in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team was dispatched, including local police and rescue teams, and the couple were found around 11 p.m. near Bridal Valley Falls.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and hit her head.
Officers stayed with the couple for the night, and they were picked up on the winch on Monday morning.
They were taken in an ambulance in stable condition to Blue Mountain Hospital.
The two unions met.
Summit negotiations in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future Eurasian
Even on a worrying occasion (the situation around Ukraine is not tolerated by the postponements), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union discussed for the first time a number of “hot issues”.
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively is unclear; but it is clear who removed the creams from this summit.
Questions on this matter fell on the evening of August 26, when Belarusians, followed by other Eurasians with Europeans saw in the telenews of the new President Lukashenko.
The Belarusian leader was an example of refined politeness, it was the behavior of a man who has just torn the jackpot - and is planning a decent old age in a higher society.
How Maidan Lukashenko Helped
The arrival in Minsk at once of the three main European commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf is not just a legitimation of the president with 20 years of experience.
This is an application for the recognition of Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European politics and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies Denis Melyantsov is sure that from now on Brussels will not be able to talk to Minsk in the same tone as before.
“The fact that Catherine Ashton met with Lukashenko gives reason to believe that relations with the EU will continue to freeze,” he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: the preparation for the breakthrough of the Belarusian authorities began long before the November Maidan in Kiev - in the summer of 2013.
"Results have been achieved with the EU - successful negotiations on visa facilitation and readmission, dialogues on modernization - lists the interlocutor of the Fire - and with the United States were held negotiations on international security.
The U.S. has even lifted some sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them have only spurred this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to keep relations with Ukraine warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for talks.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and called for punishing pro-Russian militias in Donbass with all severity, did not quarrel with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave either the Customs Union or the CSTO, and in Baranovichi is located the Russian airbase.
Brussels and Washington noted Minsk's balanced position on the Ukrainian issue - and assessed it, Belarusian experts believe.
How successful Lukashenko’s move towards political diversification will be seen by how often Minsk will have to host meetings in the EU+TS format in the near future.
In the press service of the EU High Representative for Foreign Policy and Diplomacy, Catherine Ashton was not able to quickly answer questions about what Brussels expects from the relationship in the new format.
Press Secretary Ashton Maia Kosyan<0xC4><0x8D>i<0xC4><0x87> just stated to Ogunku that, against the backdrop of the issues of war and peace, this topic is not a priority.
At the same time, there were reports that Kazakhstan may become the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format.
The coat of arms for Minsk was a statement by President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he was personally asked about it by representatives of the European Union.
However, at the final briefing Alexander Lukashenko made it clear: all parties do not mind that Minsk remains the central platform for meetings both in the format of Russia--the OSCE--Ukraine, and at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that the “last dictator of Europe” is given the status of quite a handshake European leader, which helps to solve the global problem.
The Best Friend of a European Farmer
Already, the composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, pushed for the conclusion: the main focus of the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the timetable for future negotiations on gas supplies and on overcoming the concerns of the TC countries under the Association Agreement between Ukraine and the EU at the meeting seems to be a larger achievement than peaceful declarations without specific dates and figures.
However, EU Trade Commissioner Carl De Gucht said: "EU representatives have come to Minsk to seek a solution to a political crisis that has economic consequences, not the other way around."
It seems, however, that in the economy too, the crisis in Ukraine “works” for Belarus.
Its consequences – and first of all the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia – give Minsk, which for the time being is experiencing sanctions pressure, the long-awaited field for maneuver.
According to Yaroslav Romanchuk, the head of the Mises Research Center, a former candidate for the presidency of Belarus, European investors are actively interested in the possibilities of Belarus for the supply of agricultural products to the Russian Federation to circumvent sanctions.
At the same time, supply schemes are being put forward, for which Vladimir Putin hastened Minsk at the summit.
“The initiators of these schemes – emphasized Romanchuk “Ogonka” – are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out schemes for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
Russian business urgently needs to somehow restore them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second plot, the expert continues, is related to the fact that many Ukrainian companies do not miss to set up production in Belarus of Ukrainian raw materials also with a focus on the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about 4 billion dollars of exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes may now be in high demand.
According to Romanchuk, the role of the host of the EU and TC negotiations is ideal for Lukashenko and in terms of the development of economic relations with Europe.
He recalls that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from Moscow's sanctions are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has now offered farmers only 125 million euros in compensation.
The Belarusian president may propose that Brussels work together to minimize the consequences for European farmers.
This could raise Lukashenko’s credibility in the EU to unprecedented heights.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the TC+EU format is repulsed, and the Belarusian leader at a meeting with a Ukrainian colleague stressed that the initiator of the new format was Kiev.
"It was your proposal to meet, without any hesitation to discuss, not from the bay to decide, after the signing of the Association Agreement with the EU, to understand the situation that was at that moment in Ukraine," he told the cameras to Petro Poroshenko.
However, the observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, it is rumored that it was initially against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
In the Belarusian diplomatic office, they diligently emphasize that Belarus, when organizing the interaction of the EU and the TC on its land, does not pursue beneficial goals, and the ultimate goal of this format is the creation of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok in the future.
"This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other areas, in particular in the field of security, the leadership of our strategic ally - the Russian Federation - proposes and promotes," Ogonku told the Belarusian Foreign Ministry, an agency where the words have recently been carefully selected.
In Moscow, there may be zones with paid entrance
The government of Moscow is considering the option of introducing zones with paid entry as a method of combating congestion of central roads by analogy with other major cities of the world, reports M24.ru with reference to the Deputy Mayor of Moscow on transport Maxim Liksutov.
One option that has proven itself to be successful is paid entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, see all the pros and cons.
To say that some decisions have been made on this issue, so far early," Liksutov said.
Zammera stressed that the experience of Asian cities, which by structure and load are similar to Moscow, is very important for the authorities of the capital.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the already implemented construction of a central ring road, added Liksutov.
The recently started construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to pass all traffic through Moscow.
If there were sufficient infrastructure of the tour, then it was not necessary to have transit traffic in Moscow," the deputy said.
Also, Maxim Liksutov said that the introduction of paid parking lots significantly unloaded the capital streets.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop at what has been achieved.
On August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital Sergey Sobyanin took part in the ceremony of laying the foundation stone for the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CCAD).
Sadness is wrong
Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez’s film “City of Sins-2: The Woman Worth Killing for” did not make the revolution that could have been expected of him.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), shot with the minimal but symbolic participation of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between film, comics and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental for modern thinking chain "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if we understand under the thesis the universe of noir, and under the antithesis - the cosmos of comics).
From now on, it should be read: "thesis - antithesis - chaos".
"City of Sins-2" is chaotic at both the dramaturgical and philosophical levels: both times it is chaotic in the wrong sense of the word.
Yes, some of the characters are familiar with the first "City", although, here, Marv (Mickey Rourke) thundered, remembers, died in an electric chair, and here, nothing, only manages to extract - in the role of such a folk companion - from the air of a knife and other torso with suffocations.
But the old men are literally pushed apart by the elbows of the newcomers, as if they had broken into the city from some other film, about the meaning and plot of which the viewers are asked not to worry.
So, its story, shamelessly interrupted by the authors in the most interesting place, the super-lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
Hers is the greedy-frigid Eva Lord (Eva Green) and for something vindictive to her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight is, say, indistinguishable from Johnny - especially since the faces, like other parts of the body, the characters are tolerated with inexorable regularity - is not trouble or even half-eaten.
These are not people, we understand that these are archetypes of the noir: a rock-n-roll bitch, a self-assured player who indulged in the “honey trap” of a sex detective, a corrupt plumber-senator.
Well, when the archetype waltzes with the archetype and the archetype chases, then it is no longer a movie, but honor that abstract painting.
And to ask abstract painting questions about the logic of the plot is just ridiculous.
There is something constant even in this messy world.
Battle whores from the first "City" still keep the circular defenses from besieging their native slums of the forces of darkness.
Yes and the ghost of detective Hartigan no-no, and will look at the flame, and Bruce Willis is always nice to look at.
The main problem "City of Sins-2" is in another.
Frank Miller was good that as a cartoonist he skillfully combined comics and noir, and as a director he overturned the idea of how to bring comics to the screen.
The comic and noir are two aggressively opposite “reality”.
The phenomenon of comics in its modern form was born in the late 1920s, at the same time when the novels of Dashil Hammett "Bloody Harvest" (1929), "Maltese Falcon" (1930) and "Glass Key" (1931) created the canon of Nora, which was then called hard-boiled school - "cool".
Or pulp fiction.
The comics gave many dozens of heroes to Hollywood: from the sailor Popay - a spinach eater, giving him the power of a rich man, Superman, Batman, and his brother-in-law Dick Tracy to Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other "revengeers".
But in any film based on comics, there was something harmful: the painted characters stubbornly did not want to grow screen flesh, they remained pretenders in the world around their will-reluctance "real" world.
Simply put, they were clearly devoid of “existence.”
Noir, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the world wars, the traditional novel - with its experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background - lost all credibility.
Which Forsythes, which Tibo and Rugon-Maccaras, which even the Balkan and Rostovs are generally conceivable after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully mutated into a soap opera format, and a criminal - that is, by definition marginal - novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammet, on his skin, learned what it was like to work as a paramedic at the front.
He was a communist.
How, by the way, were at least close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre as writers Horace McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dassen, Joseph Lawsey, Edward Dmitrick.
Therefore, the noir, the archetype of which they have set, first, rude and cynical, and second - purely social.
This is hardly an American version of Social Realism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable precisely because it was unnatural, but organically connected the comic with the noir.
For the first time on the screen, the comic came to life, not ashamed of its graphic nature, and did not pretend to be a "real" film.
The darkness of the selling world, where the cardinal ordered the killings and the senator covered the monstrous sadist son, was quite worthy of Hammett's pen.
And the picturesque details like the severed heads with which the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the genius James Allroy, the author of "Black Orchid" and the best - that is, the declaratively nauseating - representative of the new year.
"City of Sins-2" is not even a retreat, but a capitulation of Miller-Rodriguez's radical style to the comic book tradition.
This is probably due in large part to 3D technology.
When you look at the second "City of Sins", you feel yourself trapped in a glass ball, inside of which the snow puts the toy cloaca to sleep.
However, most often it is not snow, but blood marks, but by and large what difference?
There’s nothing to talk about and nothing to talk about.
After all, it is possible only when somewhere, somewhere we have sometimes, even on the side of a dirty swamp, but there is a normal world where you can return the girl who went down the wrong path or, say, tell the restless parents that her destroyer is punished.
When there is no place for sin in the city, sin is no longer a sin, but a norm.
It's boring, like any rule.
Chaos "City of Sins-2" is just boring.
For the sake of justice, the domestic hire has given this fresh sin a small, but a handful.
Titles warn: the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode of which a person is pinched by fingers, this gives a hell of a humor.
Hammett would have liked it.
France’s socialists must “shut up and put France in order,” says key ally Frassou Hollande
Mr. Wall called on the deeply divided left forces to “show warm treatment” for the attacking socialist president, whose reshuffles were not approved by the overwhelming majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone’s respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stay close to him," he said, drawing applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister assured that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour work week in France, despite the conflict-torn proposals, it should loosen the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande begged his Socialist Party comrades to remain "one" with the government.
However, Christian Tobira, the minister of justice, put his batons in the wheels, coming to a meeting of dissenting members of parliament from the Socialist Party and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French "to lose faith in the future".
Marine Le Pe, the leader of the far-right National Front, expressed contempt for permanent internal conflicts among socialists, saying she had no idea the new Walla government would last longer than a few months.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande is a naked king, but a naked and Prince Manuel Vall, forced to assemble a new government when the previous did not last and summer.
“And the new one will not last either autumn or winter,” Ms. Le Pen told reporters.
She reiterated her party’s call for the dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident the party could easily win early elections and was ready to rule.
France’s ruling party survived defeat in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A survey by the Sunday Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe the Socialist Party risks splitting into several rival factions by the end of Mr Hollande’s 2017 presidential term.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at Sian Poe University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to fix the economy and record unemployment.
“He has little time, but public opinion needs to quickly feel that something is changing,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation may get even worse.
“A Drug-Free City” is Undeterred
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court has left without consideration the claim of the Regional Ministry of State Property Management Directorate to the “City without Drugs” Foundation.
The agency intended to recover from the organization more than 7 million rubles. as a fee for renting a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today, the arbitration court of the Sverdlovsk region left without consideration the claim of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) to the fund "City without drugs" (one of the founders is the Mayor of Yekaterinburg Evgeny Roizman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect from the organization 7.3 million rubles. as a fee for renting the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff twice did not appear in court, which led to the decision to refuse consideration.
The reason for the absence of representatives in the Directorate of ICSI could not be explained, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not answer phone calls.
There was also no contact with the fund.
We will remind, we are talking about the mansion, which occupied the foundation in the center of the city on Belinsky street, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
This decision was made by the former governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk Region filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court on the eviction of the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the department demanded through the court to recognize the contract of free use of the premises of the monument.
According to the directorate of IUGISO, the agreement did not include significant conditions for the lease of a cultural heritage object.
The Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court rejected the claim, then an appeal was filed in the 17th Arbitration Court of Perm, which was satisfied.
Then, in the same court, the fund filed a cassation complaint against the decision, which remained unsatisfactory, after which the decision was appealed by the fund to the Supreme Court of Arbitration, but the court sided with the directorate.
In 2013, a new lease was signed, under which the fund again began to pay rent, said the head of the city Yevgeny Roizman.
The rent was allocated 300 thousand rubles. per month.
The previous administration of the region handed over this building to us for free, recognizing our merits in the fight against drugs, as a sign of respect for the fund.
The current administration has decided differently,” he said.
Tatiana Drogayeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg was offered to leave voluntarily
On July 24, Ekaterinburg State Duma deputy Alexander Kosintsev invited the mayor of the city - the Speaker of the State Duma Yevgeny Roizman to resign.
The reason was the criminal case against the arrested on suspicion of the murder of the retired deputy of the pride Oleg Kinev, who is considered an accomplice of the mayor.
How Evgeniy Roizman found a criminal case
On July 1, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of "defamation" (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) in the blog of the Mayor of Yekaterinburg Yevgeny Roizman.
This was reported to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Sverdlovsk region, where the Director General of the Legal Center "Protection" Anna Filatova addressed the relevant statement.
According to her, Mr. Roizman accused her in his blog entries of being involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth".
The iPhone turned into a wallet.
In anticipation of September 9, when Apple is due to present its new developments, there are new leaks in the press about what to expect from the presentation.
With reference to the sources, the American media reports that the sixth generation iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of the joint project of Apple and the payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re/code, at the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple, among other things, can announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, as a result of which the new smartphone iPhone 6 will be available the function of a mobile wallet.
The companies themselves refuse to comment on this matter.
This feature allows you to make a payment at the cashier of the store using a smartphone.
The payment will be identified by the user by his fingerprint using the Touch ID function.
It is reported that the iPhone will for the first time incorporate NFC (near field communication) technology, which allows you to make a contactless payment using a smartphone and a corresponding reading device at the checkout.
NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a special microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
The NFC feature was first introduced in 2004 as part of a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies that have joined the so-called NFC Forum - the association for the promotion of this technology.
The first NFC phone was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first NFC-enabled Android smartphone, the Samsung Nexus S, was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay using a smartphone on Android.
However, U.S. experts emphasize that despite the large investments of high-tech companies in the advancement of NFC technology, U.S. retailers are still cautious about innovation and are not too willing to spend money on the equipment of their stores with such systems.
Therefore, now observers hope that Apple’s entry into this market will still force retailers to accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their retail outlets.
France's Foreign Ministry: Paris' position on supplies to Russia "Mistral" does not change
The official representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of France, Roman Nadal, said about the constant position of Paris regarding the delivery of Russian helicopter carriers such as Mistral.
"I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande) in an interview with Le Monde on August 20: "Today, the level of sanctions does not prevent delivery.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not of France,” Mr Nadal told RIA Novosti.
A representative of the French foreign ministry responded to the question of whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will affect the change in the position of Paris on the implementation of this contract
For more information about the delivery of helicopter carriers to Russia, read in the magazine "Ogonek" "Mistral" almost ours.

Norwegian Cruise is close to a $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd (NCHL.O), the third largest cruise operator in the world, is in the final stages of negotiations to acquire a similar company Prestige Cruises International Inc for about $3 billion, according to reports from people familiar with the situation.
The deal would provide Norwegian Cruise, a $6.8 billion market value company, with access to luxury cruise ships and secured Prestige Cruises customers as it competes with larger rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
The agreement could be announced as early as this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that negotiations could still fail.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, a private investment firm of Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns 20 percent of Norwegian Cruise’s shares.
The sources asked to remain unnamed, as the talks are not open.
The representatives of Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, while the representative of Apollo refused to comment on the information.
The Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes spanning North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, Central America, and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, up 13 percent from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the Oceania and Regent brands, which together own eight cruise ships that go to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue of $1.2 billion in 2013, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
The $29 billion cruise industry is expected to have a positive impact in the coming years on the growth of the middle class in emerging economies such as China and India.
The racing companies are striving to position themselves as cruise operators preferred by these new customers.
Prestige Cruises was registered with U.S. regulators for the initial public offering of shares in January 2014.
Apollo became the company's main shareholder after the $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was created as it exists today in 2000 as a result of a merger with the cruise operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), an entertainment conglomerate and casino controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thea.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise became a public company in January 2013.
Genting owned a 28 percent stake, Apollo owned a 20 percent stake, and private equity firm TPG Capital LP owned an 8 percent stake in the company, as of the end of June, according to the report.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise together account for 82 percent of cruise passenger traffic in North America, according to registration documents for the first public listing of Prestige Cruises shares.

Hong Kong Democratic Movement Activists Cancel Chinese Representative’s Speech the Day After Election Decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby waving the Chinese flag.
The Standing Committee of the People’s Assembly of China on Sunday set a procedure by which only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the elections of the head of Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first receive the support of a majority of the nomination committee, which is likely to be full of Beijing loyalists.
The decision makes it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to get into the ballot and has forced the activists of the democratic movement to once again promise to stop the financial center of Hong Kong with the “Occupy Central” protests.
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing’s publication of a document describing China’s control over Hong Kong in June, democratic movement activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business center and staged a sit-in strike.
The Li Briefing is organized by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the All-China People's Congress Zhang Rongshun and the Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Bureau of the Feng Wei State Council were also expected to speak at a series of briefings during the day.
Activist students said they would gather at the Hong Kong government building in the afternoon.
The UK did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last 150 years of its colonial rule.
Israeli authorities intend to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to annex 400 hectares of land on the west bank of the Jordan River, belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
According to the BBC, the decision to annex the land of South Bethlehem is linked to the desire to pay for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
Israel’s Defense Ministry said on Sunday it had seized the territory and ordered the military to establish administrative control on the West Bank.
According to the representative of the Gaza sector Saib Arikat, the world public should call Israel to account for "continued settlement activity on the west bank of Jordan and in East Jerusalem."
Putin calls on Kiev to start negotiations on the “statehood” of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports about his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the “statehood” of the divided region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin had no intention of hinting that the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian territory would become part of Russia, but that its status inside Ukraine needed to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region an opportunity to protect its rights and interests.
However, Putin’s call for the Kiev government to start negotiations with pro-Russian rebels as equals was in line with the obvious strategy he had followed since the beginning of the bloodshed five months ago: Help the separatists take the territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory to the newly independent Russia.
In an interview with the state-run First Television Channel, Putin condemned Ukraine’s military campaign to return separatist-held territory in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which was captured in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists recently named the occupied territories Novorossiysk, or New Russia, a name that refers to the pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians begin campaigning for parliamentary elections on October 26 and while government troops attack peaceful settlements in regions held by separatists, is a “captive of illusions.”
“We must immediately start meaningful negotiations not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine to serve the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s words on statehood were meant in the context of a broader autonomy that had been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to quell fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and language rights were in danger.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The Kremlin’s intervention to correct the “false interpretation” of Putin’s words underscored the Russian leadership’s decision to behave towards the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of the 2 million population are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much harder battle to join even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million residents are not Russian, and polls before the conflict began showed broad support for the desire to remain inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed at international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy themselves, essentially handing over to the Kremlin actual control over the territory that would connect Russia’s main territory with Crimea.
On the Black Sea peninsula, joined five months ago, is the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial maritime institutions and historic sea resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea there are also mines, factories and foundries that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inauguration speech on June 7 that Ukrainian lawmakers, after the new elections, weigh amendments to the constitution, allowing the separated regions to give more control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and separatist rebels, whose weapons and incitement are blamed on Moscow.
Putin’s latest call for Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders as equals followed a new insurgency last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
Russian-backed separatists took control of the city of Novoazovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say they fear is the start of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory to the Crimea itself.
This entailed large-scale civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is located between Novoazovsky and the narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday addressed a meeting of European Union leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
“We are approaching the point of no return,” Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign military and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a draft of more severe sanctions against Russia, which will be adopted in the event of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military personnel entered the Donetsk region last week to support the struggling separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the National Security Council in Kyiv, said.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers reportedly held in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
A scandal with nude photos captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelstein expressed his disgust at the hackers, who may have stolen naked photos of his fiancée Gaby Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is outraged after a series of candid photos depicting the naked Jennifer Lawrence hit the internet as a result of a large-scale hacker scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 candid photos of the star of the “Hunger Games” Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Kara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actors Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne-based Greco were also allegedly stolen from photos as a result of an iCloud leak.
List of 101 Celebrities.
Edelstein, who made Greco’s offer last month, told Confidential: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and photos must remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and sent to other people.
Greco, who is based in New York, reportedly told the news website that the hacker attack was “shameful” and that those to whom it was aimed “felt that they were invaded.”
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with his ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two shots where she lies by a pool with a bare chest.
Palmer's film work includes Love and Honor, along with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, the star of the film "Chack" Strahovsky and the actress from "The Forbidden Reception" Browning yesterday did not comment on the stolen photos.
Lawrence told TMZ: “It’s a blatant invasion of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his anger at the hacker, writing on Twitter: “Stealing photos stolen from a mobile phone is, in fact, no different from selling stolen goods.”
Just from a legal point of view, you can not tolerate the publication of stolen photos.
A potential way to steal photos of naked celebrities has been discovered
A massive hack of star accounts may have been made through a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
A potential scenario for the development of events was described by the resource The Next Web.
On Github, a Python script was published, which allowed you to select passwords to Apple's Find My Phone service.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
To access it, the same connection of the login and the Apple ID password is used as to access the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed you to know the password from Find My Phone.
In this method, all sorts of combinations of symbols are consistently entered, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that the number of password options entered in the Find My Phone service is unlimited.
With the correct organization of the security system after several unsuccessful attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and notify the user of the attempted hack.
Due to the vulnerability, users did not receive any messages about trying to pick up the password to their account.
The hackers learned the password from Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a Hackapp user’s Twitter post, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and a password-selection scripting program was written to it.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts, access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the Hackapp user and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability is characteristic of many services, but noted that there is no evidence that this vulnerability was used to access the "stars" account.
It's not me, plz RT
On Twitter, the Prime Minister once again appeared foreign records
Although there is no solid evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has been a wave of malicious actions using this service in the past.
The hackers intercepted the device’s management and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that in this case, cloud security was not compromised, but did not conduct investigations into how users lost their accounts.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev’s Twitter account has also been hacked.
If the attackers gained access to iCloud in the way described above, then there could be a password to the account of the head of government in the microblogging service.
The Next Web resource failed to receive Apple's comments about the vulnerability in Find My Phone.

SKR stopped the investigation of the Tu-204 disaster in Vnukovo
The Investigative Committee of Russia (ICRC) has stopped criminal proceedings on the fact of the crash of the aircraft Tu-204 of the airline Red Wings.
This is reported by the press service of the department.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the commander of the aircraft and the flight engineer.
The forensic examination showed that the cause of the crash was the increased speed of boarding, the failure of the crew to perform standard procedures on landing, as well as the unintentional output of the engines for increased direct thrust.
The Tu-204 aircraft of the Red Wings airline, which followed the flight from Prague to Moscow, crashed on December 29, 2012 when landing at the Moscow airport Vnukovo.
The aircraft rolled out of the runway and caught fire.
At the scene of the accident, the commander of the aircraft, the second pilot and the flight engineer were killed.
Two flight attendants were taken to medical facilities, where they subsequently died from injuries sustained.
Three other flight attendants, hospitalized with severe physical injuries, were undergoing long-term treatment.
In addition, the driver of the car, who was driving at the time of the accident on the Kiev highway, suffered serious bodily injuries.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
The transport prosecutor's office after the accident carried out a check at the Red Wings, during which numerous violations were detected.
In February 2013, the airline’s license was suspended.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.

Anger is the most universal and functional emotion of man.
The angry facial expression is biologically universal to humanity, and every organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not accidental, but is an additional means of expressing power and threat, scientists from Australia and the United States have found.
They told about their discoveries in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and briefly read about them in the press release of the University of California, Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face - the slanted and lowered down eyebrows, stretched into a thin line of the lips, swollen nostrils - is the same in all cultures, and is made even by children who are blind from birth, who have never seen it, notes the lead author of the study Aaron Sell.
As part of a major research project on the nature of anger, the scientists found that this emotion arose for the effective conduct of disputes during the conflict.
The more physical damage one person can do to another, the more he has the ability to dictate his conditions, and he brings it to the interlocutor with the help of anger.
The researchers found confirmations of another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to become angry and go hand-in-hand, consider themselves entitled to impose conditions unfavorable to others, and prefer forceful methods of conflict resolution to peaceful ones.
Relying on the fact that anger is primarily an “emotion of bargaining,” the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create the angry expression of the face should represent the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor – and thus force the conflict to agree with him as soon as possible.
To test this hypothesis, the researchers modeled a person on a computer where each of the seven elements of an angry person was present or absent, and showed them to informants.
Although the lowered eyebrows or the forward chin individually did not make the face evil, the physically stronger person depicted with such features was unanimously recognized by the study participants.
The anger of man, like that of animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of one’s own strength, forcing one to consent and obey.
A person inflates the nostrils and squeezes the lips for the same purpose as a frog that inflates, or baboon that demonstrates its claws.
Anger is “started” by the interlocutor’s refusal to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form that most effectively demonstrates the opposite side of the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of an angry person are arbitrary, they all express the same thing,” said anthropologist John Tubby.
