Barack Obama receives the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth president of the United States
U.S. President Barack Obama arrives in Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
In addition, he is awarded the diploma as well as the medal and a check over $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among peoples.
The White House chief arrives tomorrow with his wife Michelle in the northern metropolis and will be busy all the time.
First, he pays a visit to the Nobel Institute, where he meets for the first time with the five committee members who elected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The couple then planned to meet with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit reaches its peak with the ceremony in which Obama takes over the prestigious award.
He is the fourth president of the United States, but only the third to receive the award directly in office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan when he takes over the prize.
The president does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he will take the prize as a president who is currently waging war in two countries.
He stepped up the war effort a few days ago by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which none of his critics forget to highlight.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diploma and the cheque for ten million Swedish kronor (about 24 million Czech kronor).
He intends to donate the money for charitable purposes, but has not yet decided on a concrete charitable work.
The event program will then include a banquet with the President and his wife, in which, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests will be present.
Obama was very cautious about the price right from the start.
He said, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve the award.
He also repeated several times that the price is not just for him, but for all those who aspire to the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he stated that for him this is an "invitation to action".
Conservationists Accused of Expulsion
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of extortion.
In several cases last year he appealed against some construction procedures, for the withdrawal of his appeals he demanded money from investors in his favor, said the Leitmeritz police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
The Chairman of the Leitmeritz-Naturschutzgemeinschaft is Lubomir Studnicka.
He is now in prison and faces up to three years in prison.
The sorting garbage containers in Brno do not smell good
In Prague, people can sort the beverage packaging, in the South Moravian villages you can find the sorting garbage containers again and step by step.
And in Brno?
There you would have to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage cans.
I do not want to claim that the waste separation in Brno would not work at all.
But it seems to me that even though we are the second largest city in the Republic, the councillors do not take care of this problem sufficiently.
Brno is in the waste division in the Urwaldliga, not only because we as citizens are always allowed to dispose of paper, glass and plastics in the sorting containers here, but above all because of the number of tons of waste for such waste.
Have you ever tried in the center, for example, to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket?
This is art, above all it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I have found so far by chance is the Moravian square opposite the affected goose.
Mr Onderka should not annoy us his colleagues, but that seems far too little to me.
Apart from the fact that the waste separation is also not honey slaked in other parts.
Whole rows of my friends therefore prefer not to sort the waste at all.
Out of laziness.
They are too far away from the garbage cans.
I'm not surprised.
I even offered to dispose of a few glass and plastic bottles after the celebration.
But on Konicova Street, I didn’t see any tons of paint in sight.
Fortunately, I got to the right place when I was on the tram.
But the garbage was almost gone.
This is still the center of Brno, which represents the whole city, isn’t it?!
However, ecology and some kind of aesthetics are likely to leave the Brno socialists cold.
They’d rather buy the city an ice hockey league that shames us all over the Republic, instead of buying a few more tons of garbage and offering the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my acceptance even with official statistics after searching on the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the company EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the entire district of South Moravia.
The "Paroubek" budget has withdrawn the money for pensions and sick pay
After the left-wing party gave more money to farmers and officials despite the government’s view, there is no more money in the budget for pensions, sick pay and construction savings.
But also not for the state debt interest or for the international litigation.
This causes even more problems for those who will be in the government in the second half of next year, says the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists enforced the pay increase for some groups, they expected the government to pay extra for the sensitive expenses, retirement pensions or sick pay. “This is just a postponement of the problems into the future, mining liens,” says Janota.
The loans pay higher and higher interest rates, and you have to repay the money at some point.
Too much to choose from, the treasury is empty.
If the social benefits or costs for the state operation are not reduced, the tax shall be increased.
For all those to whom the left party now gave more money: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
In order to get the pensions or sick pay, from whose account 1.8 billion have disappeared, people need not be afraid to get that money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - next year, not only 163 billion will be missing in the state treasury, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will increase faster and faster, along with the costs and interest.
The state will need the money for the compensation, then it will no longer be enough to raise the VAT only slightly or to reduce the maternity allowance, as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
As a result of the transfer of funds in favour of some electoral groups, five billion will be missing next year for the expansion of highways and railways.
These are mainly the sections won in the competition, which can no longer be re-projected and possibly discounted.
You get the most, which is also not free.
This means delay or suspension of thirty large buildings, the European money supply is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD has proposed that it solves the outflow of money in a salomon way - it attacks the CEZ stock dividends, in which the state owns the majority, and from these the money is then distributed to the transport funds.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never safe and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, 18 billion euros went into the budget from CEZ.
Annually, the dividends pay the environmental damage liquidation, the pension account is replenished and this money also serves as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also increases the actual budget deficit to the level of 5.7 percent of GDP under EU rules.
However, this does not end the carnival of revolutions.
Nearly three billion dollars went down the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crimes or for expenses for litigation, even for building saving.
Whether the state can do without this money is not certain.
This is pure gambling.
If we lose an international court case, then we have to pay for it anyway, Janota makes clear.
The minister must then save the money within the department or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserves.
One hundred million are also missing for the already begun two billion project "State Treasury", which is supposed to allow monitoring on-line, for which the individual authorities spend the money.
The first phase starts in January.
Should the finance minister not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to be stopped and in this case sanctions will come, warned Janota.
Your next smartphone will have two operating systems
Americans expect for the future with a mobile phone, on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The presented plans look promising.
It is enough to press just one button, and from Windows Mobile will change Android within a few seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware wants to present, which focuses mainly on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to run two user profiles simultaneously on your mobile phone.
You can switch between these, you can separate them into two home and work profiles.
Both will work in parallel, said Srinivas Krishnamurti from VMware during an interview for Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and presented for the first time a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smart phones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully introduced the smartphone test pattern to journalists with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM of 128 MB, on which the mentioned systems Windows Mobile and Android ran simultaneously.
The development of the new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
Now, VMware is working with European and American operators on smartphone virtualization and the devices are expected to arrive to the customer by 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains torments the hotel owners
Skinless slopes are not only of concern to the inhabitants of the Giant Mountains.
The lack of snow also deters people from ordering ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
Therefore, in the Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but now they are afraid to order binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask if in our opinion this year’s Christmas festival will be on snow or “on a mat”, the operator of the information portal Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura, said.
If you want the New Year’s Eve stay in the spindle mill exactly according to your ideas, you should not hesitate to order.
If you prefer saving money and the quality of the stay comes in second place, you can try to wait a few more days.
The Spindelm<0xC3><0xBC>hle hotel owners now offer mostly only weekly stays for New Year’s Day.
I think they’ll try to sell them for a while, but then they’ll have to give up and go on for a shorter period of time.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear, Jandura estimated.
Free beds on all winter dates always offers the travel agency Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half of the seats are still available.
That is why we have already prepared some more affordable Christmas stays for the last moment, said the director of the travel agency Ingtours, Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can still offer New Year’s Eve in the Giant Mountains, but there are fewer available places here.
Good sales also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year, the interest in winter stays is also negatively affected by the fact that there is always no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for snow to fall.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowy within a week, Christmas will also be sold out, says Schiefert.
Conversely, and slightly better than last year, it manages to occupy the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than last year.
On New Year's Day and Christmas, we only have a few free rooms left.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also run well, informed the director of the best pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Hotel Omnia is also 80 per cent occupied for the New Year’s Eve stays at the central parking lot in Janske Lazne.
On the other hand, half of the beds remain free for Christmas in the newest hotel in Janske Lazne.
We were pleasantly surprised this year of January, for which we are already about 60 percent occupied.
A little weaker is now in February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in the stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly also increase, said the director of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch.
The giant mountain hotel owners are now waiting for a bigger snowflake.
On Thursday it should cool down and if there is rain, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that there will be another warming, Jiri Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Weather Agency in Hradec Kralove.
USA: Repetition is Mother of Wisdom
It is almost comical with what student zeal Barack Obama, the president with his reputation as the smartest, repeats his predecessor’s strategy in the Afghanistan question, which he himself considered to be the dumbest.
When he finally decimated his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he wrote it off over the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Way Forward" without procrastinating.
Three years ago, he himself criticized the Bush idea of sending fresh troop contingents into Iraq, which was plagued by the civil war, as an "irresponsible and, consequently, a catastrophic decision".
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy based on military recommendations was the only possible and very successful one, so much so that today the news about Iraq is no longer talked about at all.
Bush’s reputation was not improved by this, because objectively he left his successor a much more grateful starting situation than expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
He was again asked by the military to increase his troop strength, especially by the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, even in spite of his subordination habits, harshly criticized the poignant shooters in the White House.
He called for 40,000 soldiers to be able to reverse the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but did not come up with a better idea and so he cheated the general by 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he pressed the pledge for another 5,000, even if he himself originally expected at least 10,000.
His plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to complete this process within three years is highly problematic for the entire Obama strategy. The whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halved increase will have the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the brotherly war of recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders honor the values.
The Afghan situation is marked by the contraindication - no one can be trusted and no agreements are made.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, which are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if formally founded correctly, remain only sham structures, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balancing of interests between the various ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the incomprehensibility of the conditions that further complicate the Pakistan and Iran influences.
The establishment of a “capable state” which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation is also very unrealistic.
Time horizon of Obama strategy alienated by his voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened further and is now on the verge of explosion.
Believing that the little soldiers who broke into the war cry about the "early return" can create a miracle here, only a truly romantic soul, which cannot be impressed by facts.
From a political point of view, the timing of the troop withdrawal is purely irresponsible, because the Taliban will accept this as the indirect confession of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is declining.
Europe’s politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another possible factor that can radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on the Iranians do not work, a very serious question arises for the United States whether the problem can not be solved with troops.
This question needs to be answered in the period in which America is moving toward Obama’s withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that three years remain until the presidential election, and thus there is still enough time for him to resort to a different strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
The managers of Bank Goldman Sachs no longer receive bonuses in cash
The senior executives of American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive a cash bonus this year.
This was announced by the company, which reacts to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of money, which can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the shares can be withdrawn from managers in the event that they act excessively risky.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is at the forefront of efforts to combine Wall Street premium bonuses with long-term performance.
I believe Wall Street is aware of the further direction it is going in,” said Douglas Elliott, a former JPMorgan banker.
The problem lies in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after setting aside nearly $17 billion for premium bonuses for the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the total amount of premium bonuses over the course of this year will probably exceed 20 billion dollars despite the measure shown today.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries since the start of the financial crisis.
The UK reported on Wednesday that it intends to tax the bonuses of bankers who exceed <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 once with a 50 percent tax.
France is also taking similar steps.
This year, women have won Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics.
Five record-breaking women in Stockholm today took over this year’s Nobel Prizes in the specialist categories and for literature from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI Gustaf.
In addition to the four scientists, the German writer of Romanian descent, Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, was among them.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, have been awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The award for chemistry was presented to the Israeli Ada Jonath, along with the Americans, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for educating the ribosom structure and function.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics, which the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson received for analysis of the economic report.
The only category in which no woman received a Nobel Prize this year was physics.
Today, scientists Charles Kao for fiber-optic research and George Smith together with Willard Boyl for the CCD chip invention, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines or astronomical telescopes.
Each of these laureates has received the diploma, the Nobel Medals and a certificate on the acquisition of the prize money.
In each category, there are 10 million Swedish kronor.
If there are multiple prize winners in each category, the money prize will be divided among them.
According to tradition, the American President, Barak Obama, received the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo this afternoon.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy surrounding his appointment because he is only at the beginning of his journey, and is also at the forefront of the country that is waging two wars – in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In keeping with his policy, however, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the achievement of world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering the resignation. Klaus invited him to the castle
President Vaclav Klaus receives Finance Minister Eduard Janota early on Friday, who is considering his stay in the government because he does not agree with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form released by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget and perhaps also the stay of Janota in the cabinet will be the topics of Friday's meeting.
The budget is also criticized by Klaus.
According to him, the government deficit is too high, which also deepens the crisis of public finances.
The meeting was briefed by the President's spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
On Monday, Janota wants to negotiate with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer, about his further stay in office.
According to the budget law,which now receives Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should have a deficit of 163 billion kroner.
However, on Wednesday, the parliament voted on the proposals of the left-wing party on the money changeover and increased the money for the salaries of state officials, for the maintenance of social benefits and direct wages of farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
Between the left-wing party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right-wing party, on the other hand, a sharp domestic political dispute has arisen, which is why the question mark arises about the further work of the Fischer-Officer Cabinet, on whose design the ODS, CSSD and the Green Party agreed in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget, as adopted by Parliament, virtually liquidates the package of austerity measures implemented by the fisheries government in the autumn, and that, in their understanding, the government should end the state debt.
Klaus, who can but does not have to sign the law on the state budget, explained today at the discussion breakfast with the entrepreneurs that the politicians have neglected for a long time the "serious problem" that represents the "unsustainable deficit" of public finances.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only bring a strong government, which could build on a broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, said the budget was horrendous and the government should consider its continued existence.
ODS Chairman Petr Necas told the CTK that the concept of the civil servants’ cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party is obviously no longer working.
Prime Minister Fischer referred to similar words as "strong sayings".
The head of the CSSD, Jiri Paroubek, responded to the Topolanek words that the state deficit was appalling, that the former government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that exceeded 200 billion crowns.
Already on Wednesday, the CSSD assessed the approval of the state budget for the next year as a success.
The People’s Party was also pleased.
Mandela was played in the new film by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman.
The South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film "Invictus: The Unbeaten" shows the world a lot of the country, whose struggle and victories despite some criticism that the main role was occupied by an American actor.
The story tells of sports, race relations and about Nelson Mandela.
The tireless fighter against the racist apartheid government system in the South African Republic and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, represents in his life story the American Oscar-winning actor, Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the 19-year-old Mandela if he could portray him in the Eastwood film.
Matt Damon takes on another significant role.
I told him, "If I'm going to play you, I have to meet you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who had received the award for his role in the Eastwood drama from the boxing section of "Million Dollar Baby", already represented the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which in the end he became a slaveholder, a fictional U.S. president, representing and also important to God in "Evan Allg<0xC3><0xA4>cht", as many people as possible.
The former South African statesman was in prison for 27 years for his active work in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was set free in 1990 and for four years he became president of the country.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unbeaten", and at the same time it is the name of a poem by the English author William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how to speak
The film depicts a true event in which Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to unite the country. The new President Mandela knows that his people still remain racially and economically divided even after apartheid.
He believes he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who are outsiders around the world.
Finally, the South African team rose to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the cinema screen.
He had no other goal than to play this role so as to bring it as close to reality as possible, Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was for him to shake Mandela’s hand.
I’ve found that when I shake your hand, I take over your energy, it’s being transferred, and I felt like I know what you’re feeling, he said.
For me, it’s important to be a different person.
In the film, Matt Damon portrays Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the harsh rugby world.
It was a big surprise for him when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember when I was ringing the doorbell that he opened and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, 'In the movie I look a lot bigger.'
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, he has received positive reviews under the direction of director Eastwood "Invictus: Unbeaten" and there is also talk of prospects for an Oscar.
The film critic of the Daily Variety magazine, Todd McCarthy, summed up his analysis in the following words: "This was a very good story, a very well-executed film."
In the film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent positive reviews.
Light secret about Norway solved: the Russians have tested a rocket
A special light effect was observed over Norway of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry has just admitted that an intercontinental ballistic missile has been tested near the Norwegian border.
However, the launch was not successful again and the missile, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, will slowly become a nightmare for the Russian generality and the Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence on the ground during the missile test did not have a positive effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava is usually not started at all or has been damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers it is already written about "Bulava" as about a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly, but shines
This was the 13th attempt, which was normal in the beginning.
It was only at the end of the flight that technical damage to the rocket occurred.
The engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, "Bulava" launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which sailed under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows firing from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light caused by an indefinite flying object over northern roads was actually the damaged "Bulava".
In addition, the Norwegians have not doubted from the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
This time, the Generalitat has defended itself against it and claims that it is impossible to speak clearly of a failure.
The first two stages of the rocket did not fall out and only the third stage was affected by the accident.
In the previous cases, the engines were immediately damaged in the first stage.
Even if no test launch was carried out without error, the Ministry of Defense’s leadership considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success therefore meets the generality with optimism and so it is still claimed that the "Bulava" will fly once without problems and even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of up to 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defenseman Vyacheslav Fetisov, at the age of 51, presents himself again in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup holder is helping his team CSKA Moscow in trouble, and is probably already in the Friday duel KHL against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who completed his career at the age of forty, in 1998, is currently president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas was injured, we urgently need another defender.
Fetisov has regularly trained and agreed to support the team.
We only need to clarify a few remaining formalities, the AP quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
It is not clear whether the return of the famous ice hockey player will affect only one game.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, Nemcinov said.
When Fetisov returns to the ice rink, he becomes the oldest Russian professional ice hockey game after AP.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played an entire season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one and was able to score 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
In the dress of the Soviet Union he has won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championships and he has also triumphed in the Canada Cup as well as in the Junior World Cup.
In the second half of his career, he also gained success in the NHL, where he won the Stanley Cup twice in the Detroit Dress.
He has been a member of the Ice Hockey Star Room since 2001.
Hyundai gave in to the unions. All overtime is canceled
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the union on the abolition of all overtime.
Due to frequent overtime arrangements, the union announced its readiness to strike on Monday.
This was confirmed by the spokesman of the Hyundai automobile factory, Petr Vanek.
However, the management wants to agree with the trade unionists on a Saturday shift this week.
We must not give up our production plan, which is a principle, so on Saturday, December 19, volunteer overtime was proposed for the reason that two layers of work would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz wrote that the company offered employees who would work the Saturday shift a bonus of 400 CZK.
The employees will also receive it afterwards for the Saturday shift from November 28.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of employees for the proposed overtime.
Either they get paid the overtime surcharge or they can take a replacement holiday on December 28 to extend the Christmas holidays, Vanek said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday class will be paid the fare and lunch.
Taking into account that overtime was the most urgent and burning point regarding the demands and complaints of the trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect on the abolition of all overtime for the month of December, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
The employees of the automobile factory had until last week been forced to work almost every day after the eight-hour shift for another 2 over-hours.
As of the signing of the agreement, the willingness to strike on the part of the trade unions will be revoked.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists are expected to take place on Friday afternoon.
Trade union leader Petr Kuchar said on Wednesday that if they can agree to meet the demands and sign a joint document, they are ready to lift the strike readiness.
Last week, on Wednesday, the situation in the automobile factory escalated when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike for constant overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management, on the other hand, considered that the employees had to do the overtime to meet the automotive supply needs.
The trade unionists also demanded in their Monday’s strike readiness statement that the employees who had cut off production the previous Wednesday should not be sanctioned.
In the area of overtime, trade unions are demanding that overtime work be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, this year they are demanding the payment of 5,000 kroner.
Hyundai’s Nosovice automobile factory now employs 2,000 people.
Serial production started at the company in November last year.
By this September, about 80,000 vehicles had been manufactured here, the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also works in ‘steeled’ HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists are testing new compounds to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also acts on viruses that are already resistant to drugs.
This fact prevails against the disadvantage that the connection to conventional virus variants does not work as strongly as one of the already existing drugs.
AIDS cannot be cured yet.
However, the composition of the drug can prolong the life of the patient and prevent the proliferation of HIV viruses in the body.
However, your intake is accompanied by a whole range of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of virus proliferation also results in the development of so-called resistant viruses against which drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, from the VSCHT (Chemical-Technological University) Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to dealing with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances called metallocarborane act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
The metallocarboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus proliferation in a different way than all the drugs used today, so they can overcome the resistance problem.
In their work, the scientists arrive at new "improved" compounds, which were prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the virus protein.
The metal carboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-layered cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms coupled by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Insidious and persistent virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus, which is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV virus cleavage caused by the HIV protease, no mature infectious virus particles would be produced.
When we turn off the HIV protease, we also turn off the multiplication of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in the press report published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences CR.
In the paper, which was published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe entire series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are coupled by a short organic chain, which is then systematically further modified.
Slightly weaker, but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against the HIV protease was tested in the test tube, also against their persistent (resistant) variants, which were obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of the metallocarborane on the usual enzyme variant is not as strong as that of the clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants, against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action, as well as its other properties, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical designs, makes the metallocarboranes interesting compounds for further research aimed at the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry of the Academy of Chemistry.
Dispute over budget. ODS went on fisherman who defends himself
The chairman of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approved budget for next year as "horrific" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its continued existence.
The statement of the ODS called the Prime Minister as "strong statements".
There is supposed to be time for analysis.
Deputy ODS Chairman Petr Necas said that the concept of the civil servants’ cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party is obviously no longer working.
According to Necas, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on the minority in parliament when it comes to the fight against the rising deficit, or whether he wants to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary links.
The approach of the SDGs and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, Necas pointed out.
Parliament adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday, but with proposals for changes by the Left Party for more than 12 billion crowns.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has opposed the proposals of the Social Democracy that they covertly increase the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic is expected to have a surplus of 163 billion kroner.
The ODS has left the Chamber before the vote, so it has complied with the government's wish, because the amended budget is also only a less bad variant of the budget provisional.
Disappointment and senselessness
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of his disappointment and sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government was still assessing the current situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign in the event that the amendment proposals would be accepted, the situation would have looked different.
According to Czech television, Janota joined the prime minister for Monday after the government deal.
He said he is considering his further stay in the office.
The reason for this is his disappointment at negotiating the budget.
To what extent Fischer is in favour of the further fight against the budget deficit, according to Necas, the Social Democracy (CSSD) nominees who had enforced the changes in the budget have nothing to do with the government.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will step down if parliament continues to pass deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sick pay and pensions or the service bill.
Topolanek: Ministers nominated by ODS were not wrong
This is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS have not made any mistakes, Topolanek pointed out in a text message from the United States.
It has mentioned that in some ministries in the deputy function there are people who confess to TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to give up the fight against the deficit level of public finances, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he relies on the left-wing majority that is currently in parliament".
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the bourgeois democrats.
I have not thought about it, and if that is the case, then I will deal with it," Defence Minister Martin Bartak, who was nominated by the Citizens' Democrats, told reporters in parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels in the afternoon for the European Council meeting.
The ODS resigned at the request of the Prime Minister
At the same time, Necas stressed that the SDGs would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister explicitly asked the MPs of the Citizens’ Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We are not orphans, we are not small children, so he responded to the question of whether the SDGs were not pushed back during the political negotiations on the budget by the absence of the party chairman in Parliament and in the Czech Republic.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
Already when I gave up the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily about the Bolshevikization of Parliament and the destruction of everything positive, Topolanek himself responded.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railway), fewer trains will run for approximately the same fare.
From 13 December, the Czech Railways will stop or limit some less-used express and local trains, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total traffic volume will be reduced by two percent from the day of validity of the new timetable compared to today.
Most fares including basic and customer fares will not be changed.
Several connections to the capital receive, for example, the inhabitants of the Ostrava area, the railway uses trains of the Pendolino type for this route.
The express train will no longer travel to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Fewer express trains will also run on the route Prague - Pisak - Budweiser, in principle, direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The biggest reduction is planned for the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (K<0xC3><0xB6>nigsgraz), a total of eight percent, on the contrary, Prague and the surrounding area can look forward to an increase.
Two night trains will also be cancelled on the route Prague - Tabor - Budweis and on a few days a week the operation of some high-speed trains on the route Prague - Pisek - Budweis will be reduced.
One of the biggest changes is the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, currently the inhabitants of Milovice have to switch to Lysa nad Labem.
It is the 15th route of the Esko suburban traffic system, which can be opened thanks to the electrification of the railway from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance routes to the capital will end at the destination station Prague - Hauptbahnhof.
The CD introduces more lines SC Pendolino between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run in two hours.
With the Pendolino, passengers have been unable to travel to Bratislava since December 13.
This year's regional rail bill: an increase of 200 million
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport. In total, the railway will receive four billion kroner in order to pay for the so-called loss of liquidity in the next year, the same as this year. The local trains will supply the districts, in total, they will pay eight billion kroner for this next year, with the state paying three billion kroner.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For local trains as well as express trains, the railway has concluded a ten-year contract again, so far the contract has only been concluded for one year.
The railway praises the system, perhaps that is why it did not use the vast majority of tickets to raise prices.
Changes only occur with one-day network tickets CD Net and with cheap internet tickets eLiska.
For passengers without the customer card, the price of CD Net is increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the driven plug, until now it was uniform for the trip between any district cities and cost 160 kroner.
Philippine militants arrested more than 50 people, children were released.
Militants kidnapped 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
This was stated by the AFP agency, which initially only informed about 65 detainees.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 militants allegedly used the hostages as a living shield when fleeing from the police.
The local negotiators are now working to release the remaining hostages.
According to the AFP agency, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is the arms faction of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police pursued the kidnappers because of the violence, which called for acts of revenge between the two local clans of families.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, due to the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed, the right of standing was imposed.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre, which was associated with the election to the governor's office, were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of participating in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, Patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
On Tuesday, however, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government.
South Africa’s history affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Nelson Mandela
In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Clint Eastwoods comes to the American cinemas "Invictus: The Unbeaten", which includes part of the life story of the former President of the Republic of South Africa, Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous fighter against apartheid has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was allegedly elected by Mandela himself a few years ago.
The supporting role of the legendary South African champion in rugby, Francois Pienaar, has been given to Matt Damon.
With the release of the film, reactions from critics as well as the public will also be heard.
Nelson Mandela
His full name is Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakhar Prize, and in 1993, together with de Klerk, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because it comes at a time when in South Africa, on the one hand, preparations for the World Cup culminate, but at the same time the media shake the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the news agency AP, the reactions to the new film in South Africa are positive for the time being, despite numerous reservations against the cast of the main roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film.
I have dreamed of this role for many years and have been well prepared for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela several times in person so that I could receive his energy, as they say, he performed in an interview after the film’s festival premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good if we can remember Mandela’s personality and his message with this film.
This is a story of South Africa, but it affects every person, he added.
In the dress of the rugby national team
The film is based on the book by British writer John Carlin, loosely translated “In the Role of the Enemy”: Nelson Mandela and the game that united the people portrays the South African human rights defender within his first presidential term.
In the course of the film, Morgan Freeman strives to bring together two racial and day-to-day demarcated populations and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the World Cup field in his role in the South African National Rugby Dress, which was won by South Africa at the time.
For the entry of the grass in the dress, which in South Africa is considered almost like a sacred act, Mandela collected large ovations fourteen years ago, mainly from the white audience and thus won the recognition of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may accomplish it by bringing people back together into a single nation, led by rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa is improving will only show.
However, the white South Africans are skeptical, as Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to the UK, has revealed in a recent interview for LN.
The championship begins on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers burn for several 10 million crowns
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the company Ceps in the switchgear at the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district fire brigade Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units were involved in the fire.
Initially, the fire brigade wanted to burn out the transformers, but later it changed its view and now the fire is extinguished with a mixture of water - foam and special extinguishing agents.
The cause was a technical defect, a transformer internal short circuit.
No one was injured, the accident threatened, according to the company's spokeswoman, Pavla Mandatova, the security operation of the management system did not.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will be counted only after the fire.
According to Mandatova, the destroyed transformer must be replaced by a new one.
For over 10 years, nothing similar has happened at the company Ceps, errors of this kind are rare, she added.
According to CEZ spokesperson for North Bohemia, Sona Holingerova, the power supply was not interrupted, and the fire at the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps operates in the Czech Republic as the sole operator of the line system, the 400 kV and 220 kV power lines.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switchgears with 67 transformers, which transmits the electrical energy in distribution system and line track with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jancura files criminal charges for defamation against three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is today suing three social democratic leaders for defamation.
Against Michal Hasek from the district of South Moravia, Radko Martinek from the district of Pardubice and the head of the district of Olomouc, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute radio interview.
The lawsuit is related to the company’s effort to operate regional train services in some districts.
However, all regions have finally signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three leaders attack us and say that we take out the raisins, while we have submitted the offer only about the scope, as it was agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways, which were completed last week.
We have no choice but to defend ourselves.
Because of this slander of the Society Student Agency, Jancura told the Radiojournal.
At the same time, he stated that he has evidence from all districts that they have taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the collection of the criminal record for the continuation of the media show of Jancura, which serves him as a free advertisement for his company as well as for his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend my good name and the good reputation of my district, and I also call on other leaders to do so.
I assume that it will also become clear in this matter that it is Jancura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses false and untrue arguments, Hasek said.
Jancura reported last week that he has invested several million crowns in advertising, which will point to the disadvantageous step of the districts.
He told the Radio Journal that he is interrupting the campaign after Christmas and wants to continue it after the New Year.
He said he would continue to campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the districts agreed to operate regional rail transport with the Czech Railways and had not tendered for the order in a high of 150 billion crowns.
According to Vancura, such conduct is unlawful and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train traffic in the districts, according to Jancura, he was already threatened by a member of the CSSD.
The only threat was that if we don’t give up, we could lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a member of the CSSD, I know who it is, I do not say his name, said today Jancura to the Radiojournal.
Free and voluntary vaccination against pneumococcal disease
Immunization against pneumococcal changes the usual from January.
It is the first to be free and voluntary for families.
But even now, voices are saying that the mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of the free pneumococcal vaccine culminate.
The Institute of Medicine already sets the maximum prices for the vaccines that the health insurance companies have to pay.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination process.
New Vaccination
Vaccinations free for August children
Starting in January, children can be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease free of charge, who were born on August 2 last year and later.
The condition is that they have not yet received a vaccine dose.
Those who have already started vaccination in the last year or earlier will also have to pay for further revaccination themselves.
The first dose should be given between the 3rd and 5th month of the child's life.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns and more for one dose.
For the vaccination of the youngest children, four doses are required.
Overall, experts estimate that the health insurance for the vaccine doses spend 300,000 to 450,000 crowns per year.
However, they save on the treatment that children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about 500,000 per year on all of the children’s area vaccinations.
The mandatory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococci cause middle ear inflammation, but also serious infections including brain skin inflammation and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections kill up to 28 children up to the age of 10 after being examined in hospitals every year.
Outside the Czech Republic, mandatory vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease has been introduced in about 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be mandatory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
As of January, it will be paid by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
For example, the head of Nahla’s citizens’ association, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned that the mandatory vaccination would be better.
His association has been promoting the pneumococcal vaccine for the long term.
The experts at the international conference, in which our association was involved, were not very satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
That's not entirely ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in enforcing at least that.
I think that’s the path we have to take now, Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal disease.
At this point, we are not considering this at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sesen.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors claim.
The chairman of the specialist society of practical pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that a voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the number of repeat vaccinations "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as a voluntary," says Cabrnochova.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of parents to vaccinate their infants against pneumococcal disease by next year.
The vaccination against pneumococcal disease is also groundbreaking in that it is paid for as the first area vaccination by health insurance companies and not by the state.
The insurance companies should spend the money on prevention, so they save for further treatment, Cabrnochova explains.
The doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
This, however, is a concern of the practical pediatricians, which concerns the purchase of vaccines.
After the initial project, the vaccines should be purchased by the insurance companies and then received by the doctors in the same way as other vaccines issued to them by the state.
Some MPs, however, feared that the insurance companies could "extract the money from health insurance".
That is why doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance companies pay for them.
According to the estimates, the individual practical doctors will have to invest 40,000 crowns per month, which is a significant sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
U.S. artist's son involved in 'museum theft'
The son of the famous American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta was accused of attempting to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father’s museum.
According to the Pennsylvania Police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught with a trailer when he was loading 90 paintings into his vehicle.
It is said that Frank Frazetta junior and another man used a excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
The 81-year-old Frank Frazetta Senior is famous for his portrayal of figures such as Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
According to the Associated Press, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying Frank Frazetta Junior may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported that, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed he was instructed by his father "to enter the museum by any means necessary to bring all the paintings into a warehouse".
The agency said Frank Frazetta Senior refused to grant any permission.
Labour defends government and tax hikes
The ministers defended the tax increases and spending stops announced in the preliminary report against criticism of the opposition, the economy and the unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had let an opportunity “dwindle” to show that he was serious about reducing the deficit by delaying the decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer also came under fire for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5 per cent increase in social security and a 1 per cent cap on public payrolls for 2011.
Social security aggrieved
Unions have protested that low-wage recipients are being punished for a recession they did not cause and warned of impending “problems.”
The rise in social security – to about <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion a year – has angered the private sector, which says this is a job tax, although the focus should be on the economic recovery.
The increase, which is limited to those earning more than <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
MOTION FOR A RESOLUTION on the proposal from the Commission
Increase in social security by a further 0.5% from April 2011
This year, the economy shrank by more than the expected 4.75%
New 50% Tax on Banker Bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses rejected
Tax discounts for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in state pensions by 2.5%
According to estimates by the Treasury, someone with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 will be <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year poorer and someone with <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 a year will be <0xC2><0xA3>190 poorer, while a person with an annual income of <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 will be <0xC2><0xA3>110 richer.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "difficult decisions", but they also said that 60% of the additional tax burden would be borne by the 5% of top earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the outlined tax increases and spending caps would be “a drop on the hot stone” compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big numbers, they will bring us the deficit halving and this is absolutely necessary over the next four years," he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
The Labour Party’s predictions about future economic growth – which affect the size of the new debt and the speed of the deficit deduction – were questioned after the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to revise previous figures.
He said in his statement that the economy is likely to shrink by 4.75% this year – far more than the 3.5% decline predicted in April – while the debt would be <0xC2><0xA3>3 billion higher than previously forecast.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who want to launch a new ad campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour’s “debt crisis,” said the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 billion debt over the next six years is unsustainable.
They added that ministers have failed to present a credible plan for how they will repay this and push themselves “cynically” before difficult decisions until after the election – which must take place by June 2010 at the latest.
"They didn't say anything significant about what they were going to do," said Shadow Treasury Secretary Philip Hammond, "they had their chance to do it, and they let them pass."
"The important announcements are made only after the election, whoever wins them".
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be kept from future cuts, unlike in the Conservative proposals, which see the deficit cap coming faster and more likely.
But the Liberal Democrats said the money won by the tax hikes and spending stops is used to cover next year’s spending, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans were “built on sand.”
The BBC’s political editor, Nick Robinson, said that at the time of the announcements – such as the above inflation adjustment for some disabled people’s pensions next April – the chancellor would be subject to the blame for the voter turnout, as the money could simply be recovered next year.
Labour insists on providing the extra help when people need it most and that the situation is reassessed in September 2010.
"Hohler Etat"
Although the ministers have not announced any government details beyond 2011, economists say the pressure on public spending will only come to bear in the medium term.
The recognized Institute for Tax Investigations said the Chancellor’s figures would mean strong cuts in many areas, possibly also in the fields of transportation, higher education, science and defense in the future.
“It only shifts the pain to later,” said its director Robert Chote.
“Significant announcements will only be made after the election, whoever wins them,” added Roger Bootle, an economic advisor at the accounting firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow pre-state report. The markets recognize that."
FBI Investigates 'Determination of US Citizens in Pakistan'
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist links in Pakistan.
The men were arrested in a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in eastern Punjab province, the American embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it is investigating whether these are the same men who were reported missing last month in the U.S. state of Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said they were also looking for information about the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani descent, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
“If they are American citizens, of course, we are very interested in the charges that are being brought against them and the circumstances in which they are being held,” Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was aware of the arrests and was in touch with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to find out their identities and the purpose of their stay there, in case it is actually the missing students,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had been interested in the house earlier and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men.
The Reuters news agency reported that it declined to comment on the arrests, but it said the U.S. must “work more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to eradicate the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The five students were reported missing by their families in Northern Virginia at the end of November.
Amnesty condemns ‘abuses’ in Iran
According to a report by Amnesty International, human rights in Iran are still just as bad as they have been for the past 20 years.
The report details “abuse patterns” by the regime, both before and after the contested presidential elections in June.
One man cited in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has rejected previous criticisms of its human rights record.
Officials said the criticism was politically motivated.
Following the contested election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran, leading to the largest street protests since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens received prison sentences and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
BBC Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, who is now in London, said that at the start of the protests the top leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the allegations of abuse and ordered the closure of the Kahrizak prison.
But since then, there has been no tolerance on the part of the authorities for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International cited the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged with "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election results.
"They hit me in the face more often," he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head ... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was still bleeding and half unconscious, released on the street, Amnesty said.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters who had been arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others were raped.
The Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations, but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former inmate who said he and 75 others had been detained for more than eight weeks in a container at a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government’s reactions to it, but so Amnesty, the mandates and power of these bodies would be unclear and the results obtained by the parliamentary committees would not have been published.
The group said at least 90 people had been arrested in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was set up in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow have been used to turn a landmark in Bristol into a racetrack.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders who fought for cash prizes.
At the top of the slope in Brandon Hill Park there was a short jump at the beginning of a 100 meter long slope.
Student John Hickman, who studied medicine in the fourth year, said there was a beautiful view from the top of the slope, but it was also quite intimidating.
It is a great view with all the lights of the city glistening below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talent."
Prizes were awarded for the best pieces of art executed on the slope - or tricks.
After the event on Thursday evening, the snow is left to melt.
Still she and I
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted in favor of a ban on the construction of minarets and concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe is widespread, John Bowen, an American academic, has written a well-founded and well-considered report on whether Muslims can be integrated into one of Europe’s declared most secularized societies — and be integrated.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's latest work: "Why the French don't love headscarves" (original title: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves") (2006), an elegant and tightly-arguing study of a dispute that has plagued and affected the country for over a decade and a half.
Bowen’s latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the 5 to 6 million Muslims in France, as Bowen calls "Islamic Freedoms".
He is a good listener, he reproduces debates between teachers and students about the issues that worry them the most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly profane matters, he claims, that make up daily life, in stark contrast to the political dramas that the media engage in.
The author recognizes a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly with the exception of Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim on the one hand and a good citizen on the other in a modern secular society.
They don’t have all the arguments on their side.
The Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists who interviewed Bowen mostly disagree with their Salafi counterparts – proponents of puristic Sunni Islam, which is associated with Saudi Arabia – who today show a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But an agreement requires a give and take on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French political decision-makers (and the intellectual elite who so passionately guard the separation of church and state) really feel committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may have experienced harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants, and Jews, who in turn had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He recognizes a "aggravation of the value screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The world's most desolate view
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that characterizes it melts at an alarming rate, taking with it life that can’t survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have moved into the newly open water, with diplomats, lawyers and now also authors in their keel water.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws in "On Thin Ice" (original title: "On Thin Ice") a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Wandering through the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of arctic explorers who have proven themselves in hunting polar bears.
Admiral Nelson’s encounter with a polar bear as a valiant 14-year-old sailor at sea, who fought only with his musket’s shotgun, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears caught swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were taken to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance at the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 polar bears at a performance.
Even today, zoos still typically have a millionth of the habitat of a wild old animal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore has become quite green from the algae that grow in the hollow hairs of its fur.

Ellis refers to the reports of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat posed by hunters for the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America, and Russia, enforcement continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and motor sled-driven Inuit use powerful assault rifles to track their prey.
Ironically, the ice will last the longest in the waters in the north of these two hunting nations.
In his new book "After the Ice" (original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine "New Scientist", offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future could develop.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the speed of change.
However, this is not due to a lack of explanations.
Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering journeys in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for the first time hinted at the vortex of pack ice.
In the Cold War, submarines measured the shifting gears during landing.
A useful addition are satellite measurements and the large-scale deployment of measuring probes on icebergs, but still much is achieved by fearless people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the peculiar, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice, which is formed by saltwater inlets that are compressed during freezing.
But, from the bear on the ice to the microscopic wonders in the ice, all are threatened when the summer ice disappears, which is expected between 2013 and 2050.
“In a few months, it could be us.”
Marines were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths in Arlington
Commander-in-Chief De'Angelo Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women in whose footsteps they walked.
“In a few months, from wherever we are brought back, we could be,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I wish someone would do the same for me, so I try to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered on Saturday morning to lay wreaths on the graves of veterans in several sections of Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992 when he and a few others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife, Karen, who make this trip every year, stop in different cities along the way to hold events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which expanded the event to other states.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, in areas of the Pentagon, on graves at the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second time, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase and transport the cranes.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased professional soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way of giving back to those who brought the victims.
She said this is a small contribution to how we can support our soldiers as civilians.
It’s like visiting a family cemetery.
Packed in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers wandered across the extensive lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers targeted older graves from the First and Second World Wars and the Vietnam War, as these are not as often visited as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The mood was cheerful, children played and couples held hands as they carried the fresh pine branches to the graying gravestones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red bow attached to the upper part.
Section 60, which is located nearby and where mostly veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, remained almost quiet.
The United Service Organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of the current wars filled this area.
Some cried openly, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the icy air.
Some read the names carved in stone, while others bowed down to small black-and-white square cards, which had been stuck in the damp mud for those whose gravestones had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears in front of her son’s grave.
She drove 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave site of Marine Infancy Officer David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free... my son paid for it, she said.
"When I've been gone for a long time, I want someone to remember him."
U.S. Government Contractor Arrested by Cuban Authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who sold mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, State Department officials said on Saturday.
The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Bethesda-based Development Alternatives Inc.
The company is working on projects for clients such as USAID, the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers of the U.S. Interests Office in Havana are trying to gain access to the prisoner who was arrested on December 5.
The special indictments have not yet been released, although under Cuban law a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything, under the charge of “danger.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include light protests and critical writings, are at risk of arrest.
Government-hostile graffiti and statements are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing blogger community led by popular reporter Yoani S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez, who often describes how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government officials.
S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been rejected.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to heighten tensions between Castro’s communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which had sought a “slow” approach to improving relations with the island.
The news of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy emphasizes that the United States will provide a return if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and desirable products in a country where the average earnings of a government employee is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has only allowed ordinary citizens to buy a mobile phone since this year, they are used today to send text messages, since a 15-minute phone call would cost a daily wage.
Internet usage on the island is extremely limited.
It is accessible in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and in some government places, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
In Cuba, the arrest of an American is rare.
Most of the few U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Interests Office in Havana.
Berbena said she could not give any further information about the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - the release of free mobile phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the group "Human Rights Watch", who recently released a hard report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, Same Cuba", citing the Castro's incitement to falter.
Vivanco said the defendants would very often be arrested, convicted and imprisoned within a day.
He said that probably any solution would be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are moving toward more dialogue.
Pakistani Government Officials Reveal Plan to Send Men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities discovered on Saturday an allegedly leading head of a conspiracy aimed at sending five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said they hope this case could help uncover an extensive network of terrorist recruits who radicalize the Internet.
Investigators said they had been looking for an opaque insurgent, known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after he found them out because one of them had made comments on YouTube's online video site approving of terrorist attacks.
Saifullah became the leaders of these men after their arrival in Pakistan and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan’s tribal belt, home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of Pakistan’s intelligence service who was briefed on the matter said on Saturday that Saifullah could not convince the al-Qaeda leaders that the men are not part of a CIA conspiracy to impersonate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were detained for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest, which have become a terrorist haven.
They were seen as part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official, who wanted to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said the men were by no means discouraged and continued to seek the right recommendations to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of the five men - who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underscores the crucial role of the applicants in identifying future terrorists and, possibly more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. Secret Service has made it a matter of utmost urgency to house human assets inside Al Qaeda.
The applicants of the organization act as gatekeepers who do not let in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who could be spies.
American would-be recruits are subjected to a special examination by A Kaida, analysts said.
But because of their potential access to U.S. targets and their propaganda value, they are also seen as hugely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become much more cautious about who they allow access to in recent years, as U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
If you try to include someone in these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?, Kohlmann said.
The model is now much more based on the Internet.
Tens of thousands of protesters call for climate action in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday, calling on negotiators at the city’s Bella Convention Center to take bolder action on climate protection.
Demonstrators said 100,000 people had joined the event, while police estimates were more likely to be around 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists set off small explosives near some government buildings in downtown.
On a day when the UN-sponsored climate talks were little in the way, thousands of activists with banners read “There is no Planet B” and one in Spanish declared “The Earth says enough.”
Some stars joined the protest, for example the Danish model, photographer Helena Christensen, who said that the trips to Peru, her mother’s birthplace, make her aware of what heartbreaking problems the country has to contend with because of the already noticeable effects of climate change.
This is part of the reasons why I decided to take part in the big demonstration - to spread the word and appeal to the world leaders to reach a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no way around it.
Police prevented protesters from getting too close to the Bella Center and said they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carrying handkerchiefs.
Under Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a spectator who declined to be named because he was involved in the climate talks, masked protesters in black clothing set off several explosives near the Copenhagen Main Canal, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as light rockets, but then were followed by "a few big explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration throughout the afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "This is something I was not even aware of."
He then continued in Mandarin and said, “Because the venue is big, I can’t hear what’s going on outside.”
He noted that it depends on the individual’s perspective whether the demonstration would harm or help.
It shows the concentration of the general public and various sectors on the topic of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "you can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Test data show persistent race air
The math performance testimonials were welcome good news for public schools in Washington, D.C., last week.
Although the Washington district is still far behind the country’s top-performing schools, evidence shows that fourth and eighth graders have made faster progress in the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what’s included in the latest figures from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) is the persistent performance gap between African-American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white Washington D.C. quarterbacks rose from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) over the past two years, but their African-American peers rose only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance air actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of African-American eighth-graders remained basically the same, falling by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white students was not included in the test data, as the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is also not more encouraging.
The gap that separated white and black fourth graders in 2003 when the first NAEP was recorded in this district was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
And although the score reached by the children of both groups has increased over this period of time, the difference has hardly decreased by 58 points now.
Some education advocates in the district expressed concern last week that the results, which were celebrated by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were being driven for the most part by white students, who are already powerful children anyway.
This suggests that we have raised the overall score by treating those at the top of the scale, which is problematic and difficult, said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group advocating for education equality in Washington, D.C.
“I don’t jump up and down for a span of two or three points,” said Democratic Washington City Councillor Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth grade of Eaton Elementary School.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee’s management style, said the message of the exam scores is that the city’s middle schools urgently need attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect that.
But what scares me is that we don’t spend nearly the time and energy we have to spend on our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of underperforming students.
This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, that targets students in the upper grades of elementary and middle school who have not mastered basic reading skills at the beginning of their schooling and who are significantly behind their peers.
Everyday Mathematics, a curriculum that focuses on games and life-like experiences from kindergarten to sixth grade, was brought to Washington under former Principal School Inspector Clifford Janey and is credited with some of the NAEP progress reported last week.
I think we need to continue working to bring the best measures to the benefit of students below grade level, Rhee said.
Others say that the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system while continuing to provide the extra money and resources for the low-performing schools that are needed to reduce the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley, who is studying urban exam results.
The conventional remedy is to direct its resources and management reforms to the schools located in the poorest areas of Washington, D.C.
The objective could lead to political repercussions working against this important agenda item.
The weak point is, of course, as with other city school inspectors, that she is trying to keep the white and black middle class.
Our focus is to ensure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the neighborhoods so that all families, regardless of where they live, can be sure that their children can receive excellent public schooling.
Janey, who is now a school inspector in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most significant elements to closing the performance gap is extending the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in Washington, to compete with charter schools.
You have to increase the school year to about 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement with his teachers’ union last year on 185 days a year, which he sees as “a milestone” on the path to a bigger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people as a prospect for the future
The tour bus reaches Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, steps out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white columns, the brick facades and the emerald green lawn.
Graciela’s parents barely finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was rescued in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus.
Their attitude and that of the other eighth graders in the group who explore Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 per year, was that of an awe-inspiring visitor rather than that of an enthusiastic future student.
"Yes, I will be here soon!" cried Graciela, who wanted to study medicine when the leader announced that they had now entered the building for natural sciences.
“Wow, really?” she said thoughtfully when she was told the school’s low professor-to-student ratio.
College in Pennsylvania was the 7th that the children attended on their three-day tour and now they have fully embraced the intended message: the question is not whether to go to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is growing concern about the large number of children born to Hispanic immigrants in the United States who do not finish high school or become pregnant as a teenager, but on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands who receive the college education necessary to rise to the middle class.
In fact, one in five of this “second generation” of Hispanic Americans graduate from college – a remarkable achievement, as many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the U.S. without having completed high school.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they show the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country’s workforce.
Those who study high-performing children say they often have a natural affinity for school and a drive to succeed.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her get to college, especially if these efforts persist over a longer period of time.
If you look at low-income children whose parents don’t have the experience and skills to help them find their way through the system, then a single measure at some point won’t solve the problem either, said Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis who studied Hispanic students.
We need to think about providing a supportive network for these children from preschool through high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela’s college tour is a useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP – up a gear – and provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to start college preparatory programs that begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they graduate high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60% of whom went to college.
Iraqi Oil Ministry signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has been able to get larger oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure at two auctions closed on Saturday.
The 10 contracts signed with foreign oil companies by the Iraqi oil ministry suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are ready to play an important role in the renovation of the Iraqi oil industry, which has been paralysed for decades by war and economic sanctions.
U.S. companies were only able to buy shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that has made a bid has pulled the shortcut.
Two American companies were able to conclude contracts for fields auctioned in June.
The thinly seeded representatives of American oil companies at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of U.S. companies, Asians and Europeans are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns underscored by massive coordinated bombings on Tuesday and political instability by the U.S. military’s withdrawal have likely deterred U.S. oil companies from engaging more heavily in Iraq, which has the world’s third-largest proven crude reserves, analysts said.
U.S. companies have been disadvantaged in some cases because competitors, especially the Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labor costs and are more likely to take risks because they don’t need to hold shareholders accountable.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies able to enter into contracts with the ministry.
Larger U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which maintain close ties with the Iraqi oil ministry and have been on hand with technical advice in recent years, have come out empty.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main players in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has bid for more contracts than any other company and was able to go home with large packages of contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the spokesman of the oil ministry, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the world’s great economies as well as a technology power.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can compete with its fellow citizens and will fulfill its obligations to Iraq.
Companies pre-selected for bidding issued bids, which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil the ministry was willing to pay to increase the emissions of each field beyond the current level.
Al Qaeda's top planner reportedly killed in Pakistan
An apparent U.S. missile strike along Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al-Qaeda operative this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
This would be, if confirmed, the second deadly attack on a senior terrorist organization official this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region, were reportedly killed by a number of rockets hitting their vehicle near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan’s illegal tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a spokesman for a Pakistani civilian intelligence service from Miran Shah said by phone.
Locals suspected of belonging to the militants ran to the site and quickly took everything that was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US counter-terrorism agency cited unspecified evidence that Somalis were among the dead.
Somalia has been described as the leading military planner of Al Qaeda, which led operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in conspiracies around the world, noted a senior official who wanted to remain anonymous, and referred to the delicate nature of U.S. airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Assuming its central role as a given, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from al-Qaida’s top leaders and turned them into operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second U.S. official said that Somalis had quickly risen into the al-Qaeda hierarchy and maintained best ties with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be known to some Americans, said the second official, but this in no way diminishes the danger he posed to us and our allies.
If confirmed, Somalia would be the second leading al-Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area and three other top activists.
The pace of attacks by CIA drones has declined since the summer, according to a summary in the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a nonprofit organization, from an average of six operations per month to two.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their attackability while brutally killing suspected informants, the website reported.
U.N. envoy in Kabul to resign
The UN’s top envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would step down from his post in March, ending a stormy term that was clouded by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
Eide’s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send another 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. envoy said he supported the troop increase, but he also expressed concerns that the U.S. timetable for military withdrawal, which is expected to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the build-up of the Afghan security forces and thereby send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
Commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian aides to help with Afghanistan’s political transition.
The troop increase on the military side must correspond to an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he did not resign, but only fulfilled an agreement reached in March 2008 with his family to stay in Kabul for only two years.
He said he wanted the notification to the UN.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now passes on so that he has time to arrange for a replacement.
What I said is that he better start looking for a successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to U.N. officials, Ban began his search for a replacement.
UN officials say he has considered the Swedish-Italian-born Staffan di Mistura, who recently led the UN mission in Baghdad and the Frenchman Jean-Marie Guéhenno, who previously led UN peace operations.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country’s presidential election and concealing evidence of massive voter fraud.
Eide has denied all the accusations, but he also said that Galbraith’s allegations – which were fired – “undoubtedly caused damage to the mission because there was already a great deal of skepticism about international interference in the election.”
Eide said he had recommended the appointment of a leading civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also insisted that the UN leadership would allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries to donate to the Afghan mission, saying this would strengthen their confidence that their money would be used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the curtailment of his forces in Afghanistan, saying the cumbersome UN-settlement arrangements had undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed in such a way that since May, he said, I have only been able to hire one person.
This is catastrophic and cannot go on like this.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that the world powers would soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran because it did not participate in talks about its nuclear plans.
During a seven-day trip through the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, Gates spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. soldiers in northern Iraq and played down the prospect of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good options to choose from, he said in response to a soldier’s question about the likelihood of such a development.
“One of the things that is on my mind is, if we have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, the war’s own unpredictability.”
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions aimed at Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some sanctions could also affect the average Iranian.
He said a "package of positive and negative incentives" is needed to "convince the Iranian government that it is actually less protected with nuclear weapons" because "your people will suffer tremendously" from the sanctions.
On Friday, in a statement by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the U.S. government joined European top politicians in warning that Iran must expect “credible” consequences if it does not comply with the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organization.
Iran continues to claim that knowledge of nuclear technology should be acquired only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on October 1, Iran said it would resume talks to limit its nuclear program and refrain from a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The U.S. government has pushed for this type of agreement to build trust between the two parties and gain time for negotiations.
But Iran seems to have left negotiations on the provisional agreements since then -- in part, experts say, because Iran's leadership disagrees on whether to commit to the United States.
That Iran has simply left the international community standing for some of the proposals they had already agreed to in early October, openly stating that the international community, including the Russians and Chinese, has brought them together in a way that they have never been in connection with important additional sanctions on Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set Dec. 31 as a deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before continuing to pursue other options, including those that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “overwhelming sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian delegation to the United Nations condemned what it called Thursday's "baseless and unsubstantiated allegations" by some Security Council members about Iran's nuclear activities, saying they are willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "in order to resolve a long-term problem".
Gates, who was due to return to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to Iraq’s oil-rich Kurdish region to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly with regard to borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent delays in U.S. plans to reduce U.S. troop strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying to Masud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government, "We will maintain your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you."
A Course Change in Older China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that taught them that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain other children" and "A baby more means a grave more".
They learned these lessons so well that, as government officials in Shanghai, who suddenly began to change course due to the low birth rate and aging population this summer, and encouraged young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and final: “No way.”
We have already invested all our time and energy in a child.
There is nothing left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after the introduction of one-child policy in China, which has spawned two generations of notoriously fat, sluggish single children, affectionately called “little emperors,” a population crisis is brewing in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 at the time this policy came into force, the UN said.
The Department of Population Affairs is determined, while the number of the population aged 60 years and older in 2020 is expected to increase from 16.7 percent of the population to 31.1 percent explosively by 2050, far above the global average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is stronger in rich coastal cities with educated populations, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60-year-olds and older made up almost 22 percent of Shanghai’s reported residents, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of Shanghai’s Urban Population and Family Planning Commission, said couples of childbearing age must have babies in order to “help reduce the ratio of aging population shares and alleviate the labor shortage of the future.”
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the developed countries, like Japan and Sweden," she said.
A step-by-step relaxation
Anchored in the country’s 1978 constitution, China’s one-child policy is likely to be the most controversial provision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy must expect enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination in their workplace.
Chinese state representatives have attributed it to this policy that the critical use of natural country resources could be avoided, whereas human rights representatives have condemned abuses in the enforcement of the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who have already had a child to abort.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their stance on one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife have been single children -- and in 2007, the tone of many harsh slogans was softened.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Institute of Population Research, said government officials have recently even discussed more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children in which a partner is an only child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births.
Posters that taught families to have only one child have been replaced almost overnight by guidelines detailing who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration has sent out city employees and volunteers for family planning to visit couples at home and push information sheets under the doors.
She also asked for psychological and financial advice for those who have more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, family planning officials said.
Disappointing reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outskirts of Shanghai said there was a surge in requests from couples who want a second child after the campaign started, the urban districts, on the other hand, reported no change.
In the municipality of Huinan with a population of 115,000, as an example, only four to five applications are still submitted per month.
Disappointed Shanghai officials say the number of births expected in the city for 2010 will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign -- slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee of the Shanghai municipality of Caolu, said financial considerations were probably the main reason why many people no longer want to have children.
They want to give their best to their first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and this was also legally allowed.
But they own, like many Chinese, only a small amount of government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West mistakenly rate the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is pregnant with her first child in the seventh month.
Yes, we are robbed of the opportunity to have more than one child.
But the problem is not just in politics.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of staff, said she only wants a child because she was also an only child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We’re not used to taking care of others and we don’t really want to.”
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, said it bluntly.
For middle-class parents with a double career, which lowers the birth rate, he said, it’s about being successful and being selfish.
The age group of today’s 20- to 39-year-olds grew up watching their parents struggle during the early days of the Chinese capitalism experiment and they don’t want such a life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, places huge demands on the time of the parents.
A mother must give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there is the spatial question -- "You have to rebuild your apartment" -- and the life planning -- "If the child is 9 months old, you must already have a resume ready for the best preschools."
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to achieve a higher standard of living, he said.
We don’t want to make too many sacrifices.
UN Group drafts plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- which has so far been characterized by wild possessions and mutual accusations -- refocused on Friday with the release of a document that records an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with industrial nations shouldering the greatest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, has shown both the remaining obstacles and the way forward.
But he was seen as making important progress in a negotiation that is running out of time as more than 100 top politicians from around the world will arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, formulated by a specially created UN working group, is silent on the amount of money rich countries should give to poor countries so that they can overcome global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options for key issues, including how industrial and large emerging markets can limit their carbon emissions and how high the upper limit of the global temperature rise that policymakers would bring.
The process will be given great flexibility, according to John Coequyt, executive representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what UN climate chief Yvo de Boer has called “the big picture.”
It shows the outline of a possible agreement in which industrial nations together would reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also gave talks on Friday a boost through its pledge to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change, from mastering floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
Friday, however, brought the same verbal fireworks that had set the talks last week.
U.S. climate commissioner Todd Stern has rejected formulations that call for mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for developed countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging markets, if they are not funded by industrialized nations.
This move announced that the Obama administration is moving a harder line with China than representatives of the Bush administration not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without major emerging markets getting up and taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text is not going far enough to ensure that the cuts could also be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern delivered his statement an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei’s statement that it was either lacking “reason” or it was “highly irresponsible” of him to say earlier this week that the United States would not help China financially to globalize.
Because the future economic direction of the major world powers is at stake, fault lines have opened up both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and the emerging countries.
The current fight is about saving individual economies as well as saving the planet, with China and the United States fighting over their respective commitments, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific need to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to act more aggressively to blame the countries with very high greenhouse gas taxes for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will develop, says Ulate, who also serves as a regional climate change consultant for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change indicated that they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, even though the leading participants say the talks will lead, at best, to a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, with 43 members, submitted a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads the international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said the small island states’ offensive is “putting political pressure on the entire political process,” partly because they are now united and calling for action from emerging countries such as China and India.
The talks were given a new urgency when the delegates focused on the fact that most of the open issues still need to be resolved before the leaders arrive to reach an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and Chinese Deputy Minister, got off their planes and rallied through the corridors of the Bella Center to meetings behind closed doors and press conferences to settle claims being negotiated over the next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering — 13,000 people go into and out of the convention center daily, guitar-playing activists stage nightly shows in which they make fun of the countries they believe are betraying and selling themselves, and draft contracts are handed over from hand to hand rather than by email — is already a challenge.
The intensity is just building up: almost all the important ministers are now here and from Wednesday there will be 60 heads of government in Copenhagen.
We’re coming to the Oberliga,” said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president of global policy at Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain’s first 225 km/h high-speed train redefines Monday’s feeling
On Monday morning at 5 p.m., a whistle will pierce the darkness to announce a train departure, which represents a revolution in traffic in the UK.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h from Ashfort, Kent to London St. Pancras and cover 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on board the first Javelin pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new UK service will eventually connect to an international rail network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large metropolitan areas of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter cities, work hours would be radically reduced, and switching from plane and car to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and congestion on the roads.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental damage could still be on the brakes on British high-speed rail.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to submit a feasibility study to the government, will hand over the report to Lord Adonis on Dec. 30, according to the Times.
As a result, it receives a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new railway line, which will connect London with the West Midlands, will pass through urban areas and places with a range of five metres where the impact on the environment is controversial.
In the open terrain, the plan will show the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final track.
HS2 will also create three options for a larger, north-leading high-speed rail network.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in the spring.
The preferred suggested option is a Y-shaped route guide, in which a single high-speed route would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would divide into or near Birmingham and one branch would lead west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
“It seems to be the best working option,” said a railway insider.
After completion, the journey time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first part, which would not open before 2025, would allow travelers to travel the London-Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared to just over an hour today.
The designs offered the trains the possibility of driving at a speed of 400 km/h, making the British rail network the fastest in Europe.
The first route was planned in such a way that 400 meters long trains with a maximum capacity of 1,100 people can ride on it.
Up to 18 trains could be in operation per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This, in turn, would mean that there would be a need for a terminal in London that could handle 20,000 passengers per hour.
Given the spatial constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he believes this plan should be continued, but the lengthy public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be made only after the parliamentary elections.
But even if it sets the wheels in motion, the rail network must be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from the high-speed lines to existing rail lines in the north of Birmingham, leaving the journey time between London and Scotland at over three hours.
This is considered to be a crucial tipping point for ensuring a change from the plane to the train, a guideline for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers Raised for Mortgage for 75,000 Pounds Conservative Orangery
Alan Duncan, the leading lower house member of the Conservatives, has billed the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he built in his home in his constituency.
The party’s prison spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron because he complained that members of the lower house must live “of lean rations,” has raised his mortgage by 75,000 pounds to build an oak timber truss at his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer the additional interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds per month.
The House of Commons approved the motions at the time, and they were not challenged by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of the House members' spending, and last night Duncan said the motions "could not have been cleaner or more comprehensible."
Duncan, one of the richest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-story house in a village in his constituency of Rutland and Melton.
Nearby houses have achieved a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes kitchen, living and dining rooms, but the Fees Office, an expenditure control office of the lower house, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year he planted a conservatory, which is referred to in the plans as an "orangery".
Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked by the Standards and Privileges Committee during a recent review of his previous mortgage contracts to comment on the increased fundraising.
The committee released him last month after an investigation of his expenses for breaking the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a mortgage over <0xC2><0xA3>271,406 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300,000) from his London home to his constituency, which he had bought in 1991, a year before his election as a Member of Parliament.
Documents released this week show that by March last year, Duncan was getting about 1,400 pounds (1,500 euros) per month back as mortgage interest.
In April, his claims rose to more than 1,800 pounds (2,000 euros) per month.
The interest rate on Duncan’s RBS mortgage has not changed during this time, suggesting that the entire increase served to fund the <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>85,000) withdrawal.
The normal stepless RBS mortgage rate fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March this year, where it still stands.
The latest documents published by the House of Commons show that Duncan continued to claim his entitlement to <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,400) per month this May.
Duncan lost his post as opposition leader to the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying after the spending scandal that members of parliament would live on “poor rations.”
"Essentially, working for the state means living off lean rations and being treated like shit."
He said, “I have spent my money on my garden and claim a vanishingly small portion, measured by what belongs.
And I could have demanded the whole damn sum, but I don't."
The MP, a millionaire from his previous career as an oil wholesaler, was attacked for the first time in May for his spending when it became clear that he had asked for thousands of pounds for his garden before clearing it with the Fees Office that this "could be considered an excessive demand".
A protester has dug a hole in Duncan’s lawn in the form of a pound sign after it became known that he had demanded 4,000 pounds (4,500 euros) over three years.
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This had been approved both by the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg for the value increase."
He added: “There is no debate about evasiveness and swindling or a bending of the rules or anything like that.
Everything is perfectly comprehensible and moves strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer."
Come to admire all of your believers in Brighton’s beach hut Advent Calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found new life content as an interactive Advent calendar for the winter months.
"Beyond", an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discoveries through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for each December day with Christmas songs as a theme.
The event started on December 1st and visitors were allowed to view the latest hut every day from 17:30 to 18:30 with free mulled wine and traditional Mince Pies, filled with dried fruit pastries.
The Christmas songs selected so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first No<0xC3><0xAB>l", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer clergyman of the Chichester Diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to people and hold exciting celebrations.
The idea for the beach hut Advent calendar began as a conversation with some friends at dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we try to express this through our spirituality.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world for climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated worldwide and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on the fight against climate change, where police have made several hundred arrests.
At least thirty thousand people, according to the police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers, are marching in the cold of the Danish capital, on the fringes of the United Nations climate conference, which is expected to lead to a conclusion by Friday, which could come into force from 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, Danish chair of the climate conference, the increasing mobilization in the world for climate contributes to what is illustrated by these demonstrations that the “political price” of failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed when a group of 300 protesters, all dressed in black, smashed windows with paving stones and hammers, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-restraint police immediately and without consideration intervened.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to their assessment, mainly members of the "Blacks Bloc", this extremely violent splinter group, which has already become famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France, in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the demonstration, has harshly criticized the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters had been arrested "without distinction", and has stressed that about a hundred of you "were still detained in the streets on Saturday evening", despite the extreme cold and handcuffs.
The rather peaceful move has gone from the parliament towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations took place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without attempting to enter.
A stage was installed to welcome the speakers scheduled for an evening of candlelight, with the participation of the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, but also many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of them wearing sky blue raincoats, made their first appearance in Copenhagen this morning as they followed the call of Earth’s friends to form “blue tides” for “climate justice.”
Today we are taking to the streets to demand a redress of the ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, Filipino activist of the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t go on like this and say to ourselves: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that dry up, watercourses where you can walk, as has never been the case in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of globalization critics has approached environmental organizations.
The MEP José Bové, a figure of the critics of globalization, announced that he came to Copenhagen to link "Climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between the fight against climate change and the fight for another world."
The Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands that are particularly at risk as a result of warming, has given the go-ahead for the demonstrations.
Around 50,000 people have taken to the streets in Australia, according to organisers.
In Manila, there were several hundred people, mostly students, who marched in red and hoisted bandanas, in which they praised the solar energy.
In Hong Kong or in Jakarta, but also in Canada, marches of a few hundred demonstrators took place to demand an energetic approach to climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organized by the network "350" gathered a few hundred people, namely in Paris, in Marseille (south), in Lille (north), in Bordeaux (west) and in Lyon (east).
Some people gathered in Geneva.
The separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia has denounced that this is a "strike".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist Georgian territory as independent, Tbilisi denounced the "strike".
About 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian War of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetian territory, another Georgian secessionist territory that was recognized by Russia.
The polling stations are closed at 17:00 GMT.
Voter turnout was about 58% a few hours before the polling station closed, according to Abkhazian election commission officials.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the previous president, Serguei Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
This election is a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili regrets that Abkhazia is now under total Russian occupation, his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze, has declared.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this area with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, which is illegally occupied by Russia.
After being separated from Georgia during the 1992-1993 conflict, with several thousand people dying, Abkhazia wants to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state, said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the electors who went to elect to a polling station located in a school in the capital Soukhoumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region with beautiful black sea landscapes.
Large signs on which Bagapch can be seen alongside the Russian president and the head of government, Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin, are all over this small area, which has 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, which is located in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, has prepared a warm welcome to the Russian representatives who have come to monitor the conduct of the elections.
We, the Abkhazian people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, as an allusion to the support of Moscow, in particular with regard to the decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, and has raised a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented by the former vice president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as the one in Abkhazia leaves Russia in control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this limit, a second round of elections must be organized within two weeks.
Climate: Demos Worldwide, Incidents in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated around the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement from the Copenhagen climate conference, where police, ready to use at any time, arrested about 700 people on the verge of an important demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to police, hundreds of thousands according to the organizers have demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which until December 18 receives delegates from 193 countries, who are in search of an agreement that will come into force on January 1, 2013.
From the parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Center, where the negotiations take place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not attempt to invade.
A stage was set up to welcome the speakers for an evening of candlelight, attended by the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu.
Moments after the train was pulled over, a group of protesters, all dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, started smashing into windows, an AFP journalist noted.
Anti-riot police officers immediately surrounded you and intervened without consideration by throwing some of you on the ground.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the "Blacks Bloc", these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, a police officer suffered a chin injury caused by a paving stone during the incidents in which about twenty people were provisionally arrested, according to the police. Four vehicles burned near an occupied house.
"We are in control of the extreme groups," police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen said as the helicopters of the security forces circled in the air.
Most of the demonstrators who arrived by train or by their own vehicle from German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan, were Europeans.
However, there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Almost 3,000 people, mostly in the sky blue raincoat, formed in the morning in Copenhagen after the call of the "Friends of the Earth" to a first group, which should represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice".
“Today we are taking to the streets to demand that the ecological debts be repaid to the people of the South,” said Lidy Nacpil, an activist with the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can no longer say to ourselves, 'We still have time,'" says singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
“In Africa, there are rivers that defeat, there are watercourses that you can walk through, which was never the case before.”
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of opponents of globalization has approached environmental protection organizations.
The French MEP and critic of globalisation, José Bové, told AFP that he had come to Copenhagen to "connect climate justice and social justice." "There is no longer any difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world."
Oxfam has mobilized several personalities, such as Danish model Helena Christensen or former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who turn to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, which is home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to global warming, has given impetus to the demonstrations.
In Australia, according to the organizers, about 50,000 people have taken to the streets.
In Manila, a few hundred people, most of them students, dressed in red with bandanas, made advertisements for solar energy in front of the city administration of the Philippine capital.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, hundreds of protesters have also gathered in an action against climate change.
In France, several hundred people gathered during the demonstrations organized by the “Network of 350”, in particular in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
Several people gathered in Geneva.
According to Chatel, the subjects of geography and history emerge strongly from the school reform of the lycées.
National Education Minister Luc Chatel explained in an interview published in the Sunday newspaper "Journal du dimanche" that the subjects of geography and history emerge strongly from the school reform of the lycées, even if they are not taught compulsory in the terminal (12th school year).
"Premi<0xC3><0xA8>re (11th year) students now have all four hours per week and the same program," confirms Mr Chatel.
For the minister "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile", but in general a concentration "of the best students."
"The economic-social profile and the literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific one," he continued, stressing: "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who would have been outraged by the lack of historical-geographical education in the terminals at technical lyceums."
On Saturday, an IFOP survey published in the Humanities found that almost seven out of ten French people (69%) criticized the state project of abolishing compulsory education in history and geography in Terminal S (12th academic year with a scientific profile). Many teachers and intellectuals complained about this project, as well as links to it.
The Minister replied, however, that there was no question as to a limitation of the philosophy of the S-Terminal programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the education reform for teachers, while 16 organizations (students and unions) had called for Tuesday to protest against the project, which they believe will fall victim to the educational training of future teachers.
The Minister pointed out that in Master 2 (M2) they undergo a subject-related aptitude test at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year an admissions test in which their teaching skills are tested.
In addition, they carry out internships during the year in the M2 and then teach one year before the students as a teacher in the internship.
He went on to say, “If you add up all the internships offered before the performance test, you’ll reach even more hours you spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours.”
The minister finally declared that he wants to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education."
He confirmed that he wants to abolish the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the "Ecole Normale Supérieure"
Fifteen minutes to talk about the deployment at the Copenhagen summit: this is the challenge that Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, had to face on Saturday morning at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Rue d'Ulm in Paris.
As an AFP journalist noted, the Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, in which experts turn to the public for fifteen minutes each with filmed contributions.
Edouard Hannezo, 22 years old and one of the organizers of this day, explained on the sidelines of the conference that the name of this event goes back to the name given by the students to the fish in the school basin.
"Among the experts, around twenty participants were selected, also according to their charisma," he said.
"Climate warming can be talked about for hours, but the core goals can also be explained in a few minutes," said Jean Jouzel of AFP, who spoke freely only with the help of slides about 50 people ago.
"This is part of our role as scientists," he said, hoping that listeners would learn that "the Copenhagen conference is based on an absolutely serious scientific dossier."
The videos filmed by these conferences will be available online on the school’s website from December 15.
The next "Ernest" day is scheduled for February and will take place every two months thereafter.
Delay in payment : angry prison guards, actions planned
Unions of correctional officers called on Friday for a general day of action to ensure that premiums and overtime, whose payment has been postponed for budgetary reasons until January, are transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The 2nd Union of Correctional Officers ("FO-Penitentiaire"), called on employees who do not have a job to demonstrate in front of the prison on Tuesday morning and to block them in order to draw attention to the "theft of what they deserve".
The 3rd Union of Prison Officials (CGT-Penitentiaire) called for "a strong mobilization in the various prisons" on which the non-payment of overtime, night surcharges and Sunday and public holiday surcharges in December is branded as "disgusting and unacceptable".
The first union of correctional officers, the Autonomous Federal Criminal Institution Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show discontent and anger."
The head of the penitentiary and the Ministry of Justice stated that overtime had risen sharply in 2009 and that not all of the overtime was planned in the budget, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
As the Ministry of Justice announced in the evening, Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Marie has sent a letter to the unions of the prison officials, in which it is guaranteed that the payment will be made in the next month.
“I am very well aware of the efforts of the staff to keep and modernise our prison system functioning,” she said in a statement.
"I have instructed the management of the prison to take immediate action so that such a situation, which has arisen due to the lack of assessment of the resulting overtime, does not repeat itself in the future," Alliot-Marie added.
The December salary is therefore low, except for the management staff who benefit from high service and target bonuses, explains the UFAP/UNSA, for which the "budget constraints" must be maintained.
“This is an absolute scandal,” outraged the interregional trade union FO in Marseille and announced to boycott “all assemblies and convocations” up to new instructions.
"The staff does not go to work on Sundays and holidays, if the hours from October to December are still not paid. This also applies to their overtime," the FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
“At a time when we are being burdened with more and more tasks without more staff being hired, the attempt to enrich ourselves with the staff’s funds is more than inappropriate,” said the CGT union of Bordeaux.
According to the trade unions, the situation is not the same in all regions; some are less affected than others.
In any case, however, it is wrong, states the Secretary General of the UFAP, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
Obama thinks he’s distributing Christmas presents better and better than he’s getting himself.
US President Barack Obama, who will spend Christmas with his family for the first time in the White House, has told TV talk show host Oprah Winfrey that he is always distributing better gifts than he gets himself.
In a special broadcast broadcast on ABC on Sunday evening, the president and his wife, Michelle, gave insight into how they will spend the holidays in their new illustrious home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be with us from the party.
"Santa Claus loves Bo too," Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog also gets a gift.
Michelle Obama strongly refuted her husband’s claims about the quality of the gifts. “I gave you beautiful gifts last year,” she teases the president.
"So please," he scolded her, pointing to the pearl necklace of the First Lady: "And who gave you this one?"
During this one-hour broadcast in an informal atmosphere with the well-known television presenter who had so vehemently supported Barack Obama during his election campaign, the president and his wife also spoke about gifts they had loved most as a child.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-speed bike and also a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought to him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember when my father visited us once at Christmas and brought me a basketball," the president said.
“It wasn’t until much later in my life that I understood that I had this ball from him.”
The First Lady, for her part, remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know how to arrange the furniture in a house at all, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse," Michelle Obama said.
Johnny Hallyday re-operates, RTL confirms he was put into an artificial coma
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to significant "damage" after an operation in France. According to the people surrounding him, the situation was "under control", although RTL confirmed that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician was re-operated overnight from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, after the American doctors had made "damages as a result of the operation of a disk drive" that he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his production company in Paris, which added that Scherne had suffered a stroke.
However, the singer’s production company wanted to make it clear that the situation was “under control” and said that a new medical report would be available within 48 hours at the latest.
However, according to RTL, the singer's partner during the last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
Only after 48 hours, however, did you have a little more certainty about the patient’s condition than he opened his eyes, RTL added.
At the request of AFP, there was neither confirmation nor comment from the production company.
RTL also confirms that "it emerges from certain sources" that after its first operation in Paris "no drainage" was laid.
The rocker had been operated on in the international clinic of Parc Monceau because of a tape-disc incident.
The surgery, which was planned for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor who had already treated many stars.
This was not available on Thursday night for comments to RTL.
Following Johnny Hallyday's surgery, the singer was admitted to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday due to a follow-up infection following the surgery.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend is going through a "deep valley", but he assured that there is "no need to worry" about the rock musician, as he is "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he left for Los Angeles, and I told him it was nonsense to sit on a plane for 12 hours after an operation like this," Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "responds well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection is contained".
Mr Camus also stated that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and he had not felt any particular concern.
Still, the singer’s concern for his health had grown since he spent nine days in a hospital in July after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone’s surprise, Johnny Hallyday had a “small bowel cancer operation,” resulting in a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health problem has been extensively commented on. Fans and journalists have not missed that the singer on stage had trouble moving.
It was not until mid-November that the people surrounding him had to deny re-introduction to the hospital.
Euro-2009/Kurzbahn: First place for Bousquet over his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medallist at the 2009 World Swimming Championships, won an international title on Thursday for his favourite distance, 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 short track in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while one expected a true record flood.
A record was improved by the Hungarian Evelyn Verrasztto over 4 x 200 m layers and the other two by Russia at 4 x 50m layers of gentlemen.
Damage for Bousquet, who wanted to grab the world record at the 50m freestyle, whose record he holds in the big pool (20.94).
At one of the two King's distances in swimming, 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed in 20.53 sec. in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually it's eight) - a premiere on an international level.
Bousquet defeated Croatia's Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russia's Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"One can believe in ever greater and in the present case I have said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try."
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are prohibited from January 1, 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 in the same competition for the first time.
The use of the combination has not paid off this time for the German Paul Biedermann, double world champion in the pool this summer in Rome and world record, in the end.
The young swimmer has not managed to improve his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), yet he has prevailed with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
“I didn’t give everything this time.
I knew I couldn’t set a world record today, but I defended my title and fulfilled my task.”
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future," Biedermann said.
U.S.: Zola's gravestone estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman tombstone, which appeared exclusively with the French writer Emile Zola, was valued at $1.5 million above its value on Thursday, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This plate is two meters long and 63 cm high. It dates back to the 3rd century AD and was always valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars.
The marble, on which "four scenes of the Dionysus are depicted in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece. There are only four or five of them in the world," Florent Heintz, vice president for auctioning Roman and Egyptian antiquities at the Sotheby's, told AFP.
It was sold among hundreds of pieces.
“The sale is still going on, but this part is certainly what the buyers have been bidding for the most so far,” Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this marble part by Emile Zola goes back a long way.
The record was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borghese family at home, after which it appeared piece by piece with the French actress Cécile Sorel, who found it used in her bathroom of her Paris hotel and with Paul Reynaud, Minister in the Third French Republic and President of the Council, before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next 50 years are in the dark.
When searching the Louvre database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of a "heritage of Emile Zola", which was opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of the "Thér<0xC3><0xA8>se Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico has been thwarted
On Thursday, Mexico had declared the conditions for the transfer of ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil no longer concordable after this leadership was rejected by the coup government as unacceptable.
After a telephone conversation with President Zelaya that took place that night, everything seems to indicate that there is disagreement about the possibilities of carrying out this transfer, said the Mexican foreign minister, Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration agency, the plane, which was delivered by the Mexican government, arrived in Salvador on Wednesday for the purpose of transferring M. Zelaya, returned to its place of departure.
The coup government wanted to force Mr Zelaya to "give thanks" and apply for political asylum abroad under the guidance of Mr Zelaya.
However, the ousted president rejected this as he wished to return to Mexico as the most welcomed, incumbent head of state.
"The coup regime has failed again by trying to get me to give up at my expense ... they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has frequently spoken out since the beginning of the political crisis that has been going on for five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the ousted president, who fled to the Brazilian embassy of Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, with a few chords.
The Mexican Embassy has presented us with a request for guidance, but unfortunately we cannot accept it, as it does not include a request for asylum, said Oscar Raul Matute, interior minister of the coup government, to Honduran Radio HRN on Wednesday.
I do not seek asylum in any country at all, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview with the Telesur channel, whose headquarters is located in Caracas.
A possible departure from Honduras, he had stressed, would only take him as president of the Honduran people.
Rumors of Zelaya’s departure on Wednesday had mobilized supporters of the ousted president, who had opened up to the Brazilian embassy and gathered around it, after which the military there had stepped up its efforts.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the stance of the coup government.
This, in his opinion, reveals the marginal character of this government in the face of international norms.
Zelaya, who had approached socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, had been overthrown on June 28, the day of the referendum he organized to prepare for his re-election, contrary to the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and Congress.
From his exile in Costa Rica, he had returned surprisingly on September 21 and had fled to the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be jailed for high treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
Putsch president Roberto Micheletti managed to organize a presidential election on November 29 to replace Zelaya.
While Porfirio Lobo was recognized by the United States during the disputed election, he was rejected by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil.
Three days later, the Kogress had massively voted against Zelaya’s return to office until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street is on the rise, the U.S. trade balance feeds optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed with a high on Thursday, the figures of the American trade balance testify to a recovery in the price of the shares of the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones has increased by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq rose from 7.13 points to 2,190.06 points.
The extended Index Standard & Poor’s 500 was posted at 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There is good news from various industries, judged Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
However, this remains anecdotally on the premise that the market only focuses on “half-full glasses,” she said.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily focused on the U.S. trade balance figures, “which show an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October from September.
Analysts, on the other hand, had expected a deficit growth.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, which reflects the economic growth of the main trading partners of the United States, commented Christopher Cornell of the company research Economy.com.
In return, unemployment reports in the United States have risen against all expectations in the last week and have now reached the level of 474,000 requests.
However, the average value of new job seekers has dropped to “the low point of the year” over the past four weeks, said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has fallen.
The 10-year yield on government bonds rose to 3.482 percent from 3.432 percent on Tuesday night, while the 30-year yield on bonds rose to 4.492 percent from 4.408 percent on the previous night.
Cuba: Hundreds of partisans in power chant "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, hundreds of Cuban-backed partisans vacated the wives of political prisoners gathered in Havana for the purpose of World Human Rights Day, and also foiled another rally that temporarily arrested a dozen dissidents.
Around the forty "Ladies in White", wives or close political prisoners, were tipped off on the open road by government partisans under Raul Castro, just as they were on their way to the center of the capital to demand the release of political prisoners, a journalist confirmed to AFP.
Down with the Yankies!, "Soldiers!", "the street belongs to the revolutionaries!", "Fidel and Raul live!" the authorized partisans chanted with raised fists against the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the "Ladies in White" had taken place in Havana the night before, in which there were no injuries or arrests.
In the Havana district of Vedado, on the other hand, a dozen dissidents who also attended the demonstration in the face of the International Human Rights Day on Thursday were temporarily arrested by civilian police, an AFP reporter confirmed.
According to this journalist, the police forced the dissidents exploited by the partisans of the government under violent use to get into civilian vehicles.
The temporary detention of dissidents under such circumstances is generally limited to a few hours only.
As applicants for the Sakharov Prize awarded by the European Parliament in 2005, the "Ladies in White" have organized an unapproved march for the purpose of the "Pray for the release of all political prisoners", whose number according to the dissident list is about 200 people, Laura Pollan, one of the leaders of whose marriage Heeman.
Mr. Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents detained in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities regard the regime’s opponents as “soldiers” or “agents” in the service of the declared archenemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that Cuban television reported on the demonstrations that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and “counter-revolutionary”.
Cuba, led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of defamation of rights and freedoms, especially that of freedom of expression.
Madman kills 80-year-old with knife and leaves 5 injured in Clichy-la-Garenne
A man armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) on Friday afternoon and injured five more people.
According to the first information of the survey, the 28-year-old assailant had injured the 80-year-old with two knives in or in front of a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures for a hitherto unknown cause, and this, according to police reports, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to an official of the Alliance police syndicate in the hospital, died the consequences of his injuries.
In or in front of the same pharmacy, he has engaged a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about in his thirties, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were taken to the hospital, where the 80-year-old died.
The other injured person is in danger of death because, according to police sources, vital organs were apparently affected.
The pregnant woman has become ill as a result of the events and she is said to have been hospitalized in a "shock state" according to a police source.
The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to police, immediately escaped to the street, the same boulevard Jean Jaures.
He had injured two other passers-by, apparently by accident: a thirty-year-old and a forty-year-old, the latter of which was heavy.
The scenario remained in the dark in the evening.
He had been armed with two meat knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a manager of the Alliance syndicate in the Hauts-de-Seine region.
Several passers-by, including youths, are said to have tried to contain the insanity, according to eyewitness reports obtained by AFP.
I saw a guy in the three-pack with a green vest.
Three young men tried to intervene.
They couldn’t because the guy was well built, reported Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A horde has fallen on him, he added, including a city police officer who broke his wrist.
Still on the boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the height of the house number 61, two city police officers, including their supervisor, tried to arrest the armed man and were injured with knife wounds, police said.
The incident took place in one of the main battlegrounds of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passers-by came up to me to tell me that there was an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put them in first aid position and noticed a flapping wound in the stomach area, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old person came, injured by cuts.
State police officers eventually arrested the man, who did not carry identification papers.
The Nanterre prosecutor's office has commissioned the district prosecutor's office of the Hauts-de-Seine criminal police (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The man was hospitalized on Thursday night.
In view of his condition, he has not yet been brought to justice.
A police source does not rule out his being taken to a nerve center.
According to another police source, six police officers wanted to arrest him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He found himself "in a state of overexcitement" like "all the mentally confused of this kind, in which the forces release themselves during the course of the action".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for suspension of prosecution
The lawyer of the French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly asked on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to drop the prosecution against his client, who is currently at his place of residence in Switzerland due to a moral violation of more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of the “Pianist,” has denounced gross procedural errors at the time of the trial in 1977 before three judges of the appeals court in California’s second district.
I demand on the spot a release from prison, explained M. Hummel, before adding that the behavior of the judge Laurence Rittenband, who was in charge of the case at the time of the trial, "lets a cold run down your back."
According to him, the now deceased Judge Rittenband had discussed with a prosecutor before his trial, who told him that Roman Polanski had earned a breeding house -- which represented a serious procedural error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired", specifically by the prosecutor David Wells.
Mr Wells said at the end of September that the authors of the documentary had lied.
Should the Court refuse to suspend the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel requests the conduct of a trial which would enable him to present the evidence for his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, has repeated the evidence already explained in the first instance, i.e. that a discussion on the lifting of the charges against the accused cannot be seriously considered, as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, even before the announcement of the sentence for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
Since then, he has not traveled to the United States.
Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama had stated that Roman Polanski “must be there to attend the hearing.”
Do you want to spread the message in this matter and not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other defendants, which is a way out?, asks Ms. Asayama.
In her opinion, "the filmmaker asks the court for a favor and thus despises his authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to announce their decision – even pointed out that “there are other escape alternatives”.
Hummel was not the only one who had applied for the suspension of prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the abolition of the criminal procedure.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate being harassed by any resurgence of the Polanski affair, adding: “No one in this room can say that this procedure was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26 on the grounds of an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was then sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad in anticipation of possible extradition.
Wall Street is slowed by the rise of the dollar and closes without a course.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday without a price in a market that was torn between better-than-US indicators and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
Based on the final figures available at closing, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technologically dominated Nasdaq posted 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
“Honestly, the market is pretty quiet,” noted Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains tight, the trading volume has become very small and I think that this will remain so until the end of the year."
The trend was supported by the release of better-than-expected economic indicators that “have helped improve the market view of the robustness of the economic recovery,” Charles Schwab’s analysts summarized.
In the US, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, which is already two months in a row and far more than expected.
Consumer confidence in the U.S. improved significantly in December to 73.4 from 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan’s Index Forecast.
However, the indexes were slowed down by a new rise in the dollar exchange rate, which has reached its highest level against the euro in two months, "which is pushing down sectors vulnerable to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have thus lost some ground.
The bond market has declined.
On Wednesday evening, the yield on the 10-year Treasury bond increased by 3.540 % compared to 3.482 % and that of the 30-year bond increased to 4.497 % compared to 4.492 % the day before.
Miss World election in South Africa
After a month of touring South Africa, the 112 candidates for the Miss World title will cross the final hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream: to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world and to watch this in front of a billion television viewers.
During this major beauty fair, which will be held for the second time in succession in the vicinity of Johannesburg, five of them have already won their ticket to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were named Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their African stay.
This was a real whirlwind of pleasures.
Beautiful cities to visit, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, were simply exceptional.
I’ve seen a lot of things and had a lot of experiences!” said Miss Sierra Leone with great enthusiasm.
This competition will take place for the ninth time in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, at 5 p.m. (15 p.m. Central European Time).
I could not imagine a more beautiful country to hand over my crown.
This experience was simply fascinating.
I am happy to have made this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with candidates and the rediscovery of "stunning landscapes".
After a month of galas, rehearsals, meetings with the press and safari, the Miss now focuses on the competition.
Indian Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will also be present at this election, as well as to emulate Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and became both Bollywood stars.
It is, of course, every woman’s dream to be crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world, but it is not just about appearance.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, throws Miss India with a broad smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be highlighted with music and dance.
The candidates parade in traditional costumes and not to forget, in swimsuits.
The show will be presented by a television host, Chinese Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee official Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with an unsurpassed cordiality and pride, assures Julia Morley, chairwoman of Miss World.
The candidates, as last year, made a safari, visiting the famous township in Soweto, but this time cost by bike and local cuisine.
However, the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who gave them his hand, was quite extraordinary.
Not common for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Their most beautiful memory, however, is undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a kind of country to promote a little more for this event.
I'm wrong with people I'd probably never be able to get close to.
I will surely return to the 2010 World Cup, promised enthusiastic Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
News of Johnny Hallyday is "very positive" according to his son David
News of Johnny Hallyday is “very positive,” his son David said on Friday on his arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father, who has been in the hospital for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press when he left the plane, in which he arrived shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 a.m. GMT) from Paris.
The singer's son, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would be "fastest" to go to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection following an operation on a disc in Paris on November 26.
The singer was "put into an artificial coma that night in Los Angeles in order to relieve his severe pain and be able to carry out his treatment," the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial coma by doctors at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted to Paris on Monday due to a bacterial follow-up infection following a disc surgery on November 26.
The singer had to undergo surgery again on the night of Wednesday to Thursday due to the pathological changes caused by the last intervention.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event at the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where her daughter Jade goes to school, an AFP photographer noted.
Yves Catoné, head of the orthopaedic and traumatological surgery department at the Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re Hospital, announced that he would visit the singer at the Los Angeles hospital on Monday.
The producer has put a heavy burden on neurosurgeon Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had committed the purest massacre.
The surgeons in Los Angeles said they were completely upset, Mr. Camus said.
“I’ve heard that you may be going to court,” he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "traveled far too fast and this with the permission of the Paris surgeon to Los Angeles".
I personally phoned this doctor, who assured me that he sees this trip as completely unproblematic, which surprised me very much, since I myself already have two disc surgeries behind me, he added.
Shortly before, he announced at RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital "without drainage, without everything" after the operation.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in the artist community.
He had the actress Marie Trintignant, operating in Vilnius a few days before her death, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at that time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, who has already been convicted several times due to failed operations and not to be forgotten, due to tax evasion and fraud.
Me Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the <0xC3><0x84>rztekammer, described him as "a man without a scruple" who has to answer "regularly" to the board of directors and "everything else is recommended".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday about his lawyer, Me David Koubbi.
He explained that the intervention would have been "perfect" and the post-operative examinations would have been "normal".
The operation "did not cause any bleeding and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been emerging since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear that for a continuation of the tour on January 8 (in Amiens) it is a bit too short, explained Mr. Camus.
The party alliance UDF (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise) becomes energetic and calls on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The party alliance, which is overseen by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou's MoDem party, reacted strongly on Friday to an attempted takeover of the seal, the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, by the chairman of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, and urged him not to use this document again under threat of prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he believes that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou would not be worthy of defending this political legacy after he had reached out to the left.
By the way, the Minister of Defense, whose party partner is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To reinforce his efforts, he had received the support of MP Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now at NC), who claims ownership of the UDF brand, since he was the first to apply for this brand in 2004 at the "Institut national de la proprietaire industrielle".
However, the place of business of the party alliance UDF, supervised by Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrous's friends, broke the silence and made it clear that they could not be expropriated and, under threat of prosecution, gave the Minister and the Member a deadline to stop using this seal and to give them the rights of ownership of the brand.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to take over the UDF Seal+, the party alliance wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 bureau members, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the MoDem party, and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist B.C.
You probably also believed that you had the right to have the name of this movement +Nouveau centre+, the slogan + of today’s UDF+, printed on their political material as well as on the homepage of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF’s office said, urging the NC party to “immediately remove the mention of the UDF name from all material as well as from (their) website.”
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required "to transfer the ownership rights of the trademark to its legal claimants".
If you refuse to do so, we will sue you to enforce the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that "UDF has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave in 2007 to found a competing movement, as others had already done in 2002 to found the "UMP" party.
The Nouveau centre party therefore has, according to the signatories, no rights to use the UDF seal (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
They further recall that the last Congress of the UDF in 2007 approved the three-year accession to the MoDem party and the establishment of an office to defend the "material and moral interests" of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As far as Hervé de Charette is concerned, the office continues that "he was no longer a member of the UDF but of the UMP for three years at the time when he applied for the brand name".
He benefits in a scandalous and fraudulent way from the lack of depositing the acronym UDF in order to do this for himself.
Furthermore, you point out that this recklessness is the best way to turn into a crime, and ironically the NC strategy: "It seems to us in politics as well as in life more dignified to make a name for ourselves, rather than trying to get out of anonymity by not having the rightful ownership of a name, in a fraudulent way".
Affaire Liliane Bettencourt : Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier sentenced for exploitation of weakness
The Nanterre court on Friday decided to judge artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the 80s to steal a part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will have to answer in court on April 15 and 16, 2010 for exploiting weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum of three years' imprisonment and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>375,000.
This decision means that in fact there will be a process in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are fattening and at the same time have the reins of the cosmetics empire L'Oréal in hand.
However, the 15th Criminal Chamber also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliane Bettencourt, which is carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heir and main shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to submit to such an investigation, especially not under the conditions laid down during the investigations by the Nanterre Public Prosecutor's Office.
The doctors appointed on Friday are expected to present a report before March 10, 2010, in which you will make clear whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she will be subjected to these investigations.
"I will speak to her," Bettencourt's lawyer, Me Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
As for the lawyer of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very pleased with the court’s decision.
This is excellent news (...). The expert opinion will prove that he (Banier) has manipulated this old lady, which must be protected, he affirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt’s only daughter has filed a criminal complaint against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-round artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother’s weakness for years in order to obtain donations totaling one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
For her part, Liliane Bettencourt had always denied being manipulated by the photographer, whom she sees as a long-time friend.
Although the court would have to examine the admissibility of the lawsuit initiated by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers’ pleas led to a large family debacle on Friday.
For example, Liliane Bettencourt’s lawyer relied on three letters sent by her client to her notary (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she distrusted Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Bettencourt-Meyers’ husband.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Please explain to my daughter that I have been writing to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
I have never been able to speak to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise since she was married.”
Nanterre’s public prosecutor’s office is again of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to react in this way, especially since a guardianship judge has in recent days refused her request to initiate a judicial protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully legal, is not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place," said prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney.
The court has now decided to give a ruling after the process for the admissibility of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers took place.
Manager Revolution or the End of Strategic Early Enlightenment?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the big French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of the management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the companies vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis the consumers before the marketing revolution: It is for the staff to join "values" determined to impose the best, as it used to be on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the factory.
By putting the customer at the center of the business, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in the place ... although the authoritarian temptation products separate factors to impose the preferences of the customers again regularly!
A demobilization of employees can lead to a fatal demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are just the tip of a much larger phenomenon that especially affects employees.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, especially those of R&D and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) “demands from all parties involved ... a proactive approach and a forward-looking approach”; it demands from employees a commitment to which the instructions of authoritarian management completely contradict.
That is why we are calling for an operational revolution, which would consist in placing employees at the center of the company’s concerns on an equal footing with customers.
The very conditional benefits of internal opinion polls
Will the internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire that Orange submitted to its wage earners, stimulate this revolution in terms of management practice?
I'm afraid not.
- First, because I could see that the whole structure, given a new situation, after many detours, finally comes to do what it has always done.
Also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - increases in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most leaders have a greatly simplified conception of human behavior.
Originating from the major engineering schools, their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
Through intellectual comfort, they take over the old behaviorist theory, which was recently reactivated by the American "neurosciences" and unknowingly disseminated widely by research institutes and the media.
Thus, and by suggesting that it is possible to activate the "leverage" (sic) to engage employees, a recent survey by Ipsos, published in Le Figaro.fr, reinforces the leaders in an attitude towards a mechanistic control system that is unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure the mobilization factors
Instead, an operational revolution necessary for the smooth functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a definitive view of human behavior.
It consists in integrating a basic protocol into every thought or practice of management: for the wage earners, commitment to the company is only possible if it clearly appears as a means to realize some of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At the moment, only the studies from the multifunctional analysis take over this conception of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a predefined doxa, which allows them to estimate through their perceived image of the company what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and put their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way, they create a fertile soil that is conducive to the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo speech: ‘just war’ brings Obama praise from the right
American rights on Friday welcomed Barack Obama’s speech in Oslo the night before and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize had defended the notion of “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who mocked Obama’s October 9 award, this time applauded the president’s speech, following the example of former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin explained, the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the USA Today newspaper, adding that she herself had brought up the topic of a “sometimes necessary” war in her recently published memoirs.
The war is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, on Thursday sought to justify the use of violence in Oslo, a way to explain his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, expressed the opinion that the president had done "very good work" in Oslo.
I found that the speech was really very good, the former president of the House of Representatives, who particularly acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words, rejoiced.
In some parts I felt this speech was entirely historical, Ginrich, who was interviewed on the radio show "The Takeaway", explained.
The former MP, seen by some as a possible candidate for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination, said he was pleased to have seen a “President of the Left” reminding the members of the Nobel Committee that they “couldn’t be free and wouldn’t be willing to hand out a price for peace.”
For Michael Gerson, former writer of George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama gave “a very American speech.”
In addition to portraying himself as a "cosmopolitan", as "he always does", he "spoke like an American president", when he pointed out that the Europeans "live in a security bubble that they did not create themselves and for their protection they do not do much", according to Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced rights, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a Bush-era hawk, called the speech on the National Review Online website “boring, high-pitched, and uninspired.”
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama defends the use of the military.
If you pack the war under the guise of justice, you can easily justify the massacre to the innocent, he warns.
The press of the moderate left, however, continues to praise the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was awarded prematurely to Obama, called the address itself a "monumental work" for a speaker like him, known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "offers a roadmap to control international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression," the California daily said.
The New York Times said Obama "declared the necessary discourse" and described his speech as "difficult and exemplary at the same time."
Remote: Three marathons for a deal that secures supplies for Christmas
After a three-week negotiating marathon, the trade unions of the Road Association and the TLF - the only employers' organization that remained until the end - reached an agreement on Friday evening that put an end to the strike order and the impending severe shortage of supplies at Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport Dominique Bussereau "welcomed" the agreement, which was launched on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators parted ways early on Friday morning, hoping to quickly sign the agreement late in the morning.
This was despite the fact that the three employers’ associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting.
However, it took more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. until the conclusion of the agreement and it was not until 18:00 that the agreement was signed.
The conflict "would have caused a lot of damage to the companies" and "it was to be feared that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The agreement provides for a 4% wage increase for the lowest wages (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for workers with the lowest wages thus rises from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"That's not much, but we're starting small," said Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now instructed not to block the supply centers anymore.
"However, there will probably always be some dissenters who are not satisfied with the agreement," he adds.
TLF chairman Philippe Grillot called for a "good deal" even though it was "difficult to concede these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
"This agreement is based on common sense and respect for employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) spoke of "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said there was "an acceptable compromise".
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and for the maintenance of the overall road transport budget in the first half of 2010, which will in particular allow for tackling the issue of the 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "the lowering of taxes on employers in the amount of 100 million euros" was the subject of a government amendment to the revised finance bill for 2009, which was passed by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government calls for an “identical” vote by the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply initially to the companies affiliated to this organisation and then to apply in the event of an extension by the Minister of Labour for the entire professional status.
This will be the case "in the shortest time", Bussereau assures.
The opposition of the employers' associations can only delay the procedure.
The association FNTR denounced a "fraudulent trade" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to disturb the goose eaters on the approaching Christmas days, laments Unostra.
For the association Otre, the agreement threatens to "save the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry a large grave in the next 12 months".
Line RER A: Disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disruptions on the RER A line, France’s largest high-speed rail network for the Paris metropolitan area and the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France, continued over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the 2nd day of the strike between the unions and the head of the RATP (independent Paris passenger transport administration), which continued to let strikers stop with their demands for wages.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, there were no trains running between 10:00 and 20:00. On the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one of two trains was ready for use and outside the central line only one of four trains.
The connection to the trains of the SNCF was interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture, which forced the travelers to change trains.
Galeries Lafayette’s department store chain, which counts 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that “RATP is making efforts to connect the large stores with traffic technology.”
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The RATP section connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one in two trains to the main traffic time ran on schedule, and almost none during the low traffic time.
As already on Thursday, there was no crowd on the platforms, as the inhabitants of the <0xC3><0x8E>le-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
So early in the morning, the station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less crowded than usual, mainly due to the lack of high school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), stated that he would have been extra "a half hour early to get to work on time".
The SNCF, which had planned to provide assistance to passengers by civil servants and law enforcement, pointed out that there were no bottlenecks at Saint-Lazare station.
Trains operated by SNCF on line RER A from or towards Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed via Saint-Lazare station to ensure the connection to the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the general meetings of the strikers again took place, during which the results were checked, which the associations had classified as "poor" after the meeting with the leader on Friday afternoon.
The RER Managing Director proposed the specific elaboration of a protocol for the RER A line with regard to all relevant aspects, working hours, career paths, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud), they demand a long-due wage surcharge.
The CGT was outraged that the RATP itself was crippling its wage surcharge proposals, stressing that the leadership was "not able to solve a problem, while this was also possible with the long-distance riders and the SNCF."
RATP made it clear that a new meeting was scheduled for Monday for a "comprehensive review of working conditions".
This also shows the associations that the company “ignores the weekenders”.
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the headquarters of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leadership who so far rejected any discussion during the strike, and suggested a meeting after a pacification of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to expand to line RER B after a pre-announcement by Unsa and independents.
The associations call for a wage surcharge of 120 (unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants). In addition, they complain about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, on which millions of travellers are travelling daily.
RER drivers with years of professional experience receive a gross salary of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,200 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2,700 and a salary supplement of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>600 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>650 for shift services, as well as Sundays and public holidays.
Turkish Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party. Decision with serious consequences
Turkey’s Constitutional Court on Friday announced the dissolution of the country’s pro-Kurdish main party, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government enormously difficult, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community to put an end to the conflicts that have lasted for 25 years.
The “Party for a Democratic Society” (DTP) was dissolved as it had become a “place for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity,” said Constitutional Court President Hasim Kili<0xC3><0xA7> four days after the decision to the press.
According to Kili<0xC3><0xA7>, the decision would have been taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes required to impose the dissolution, and he pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including chairman Ahmet T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and parliamentarian Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from the political process for the duration of five years.
In addition, the judge announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Turk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party’s assets.
The DTP now has 21 seats in parliament (out of 550).
Before the verdict, the party leaders expressed the view that parliamentarians would rather leave parliament than act like partyless parliamentarians.
The decision followed a trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court Abdurrahman Yal<0xC3><0xA7>inkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "instructions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and numerous other countries.
Numerous observers are of the opinion that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party claims to have "no connection" to the PKK, but refuses to refer to it as a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate.
The verdict of the Constitutional Court works in between the government, which seeks to meet the Kurdish community and propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds in order to defeat the support of the PKK by the Kurds and put an end to the conflicts.
The DTP leaders reaffirmed that a break-up could lead to a resurgence of tensions in Southeast Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the detention conditions of the PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan had led to clashes with police in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP premises in the million-dollar city of Diyarbakir in the southeast, which is predominantly populated by Kurds.
The security forces used tear gas grenades and water cannons when protesters began to throw Molotov cocktails and stones.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
According to the verdict, Turk assumed that the court's decision would "deepen the despair even further".
"Turkey cannot clarify this (Kurdish) issue on the basis of the prohibition of a party," he told the press.
The government, consisting of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are opposed to the closure of the parties in principle.
This does not solve the problems,” Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
"This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic openness promoted by the government," said political market observer Ahmet Island.
“One can obviously expect a reaction from the PKK,” he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK announced an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snow can come
A really crisp winter, this is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to harass the citizens, says the winter service director of the FES.
But so that its employees can try out and master all the vehicle technology.
This could be the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
In doing so, the FES is proceeding according to an accurate plan.
As soon as it snows in Frankfurt and the temperatures are below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-routes are taken off with large scattering vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include main roads and thoroughfares such as the Neue Weg and the Hanauer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
But also fire access routes, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and routes with slopes, such as the Atzelbergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
FES service starts at 3 a.m.
The around 1040 kilometers would have to be scattered in a maximum of three hours with moist salt, which sticks better.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o’clock in the night, “so that the routes are free until the professional traffic starts”.
It will be difficult if it snows only at 7.30 am.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "because then no one is ready to make room for the scattered vehicles".
Only after that, if it does not snow further, are feeder and development roads, which also includes the Rat-Beil-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, next.
The last priority has side and side streets.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o’clock in the morning, the foot people of the FES are on their way, danger points and transitions are cleared primarily.
The FES usually can’t take care of all the bike paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges from 22 to 4.30 pm, says Brauburger.
Since there is a smoothness on this quickly, as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees, the spreader is on the way.
If necessary, they will also be called by the police.
The Cradle of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: The two-meter-long and 1.50-meter-wide animal ran on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
But Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these body features, reports Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday’s journal Science.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window on the early evolution of dinosaurs, Nesbitt says.
It shows us a lot about the relationships, the spread and the characteristics of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began an excavation at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in a day, which is unprecedented for deposits from the Trias, reports team member Randall Irmis from the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones quickly identified the researchers as a new species.
In the course of the excavation, they brought together the remains of a total of five individuals.
Find confirms theories about Dino's early history
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it’s an extraordinary find: “Dinosaur fossils from the Triassic are extremely rare, usually only individual fragments can be found.”
Other dinosaur experts don’t necessarily share the enthusiasm.
This finding is not particularly spectacular, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current teaching, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
However, many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, which is why the assignment of these ancient dinos is most controversial.
For example, experts debate when the lizards split into their three main lines of development: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the tyrannosaurus rex, the velociraptor, and also the birds known as the "long-necked" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the feral orniths.
After analyzing Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa Hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, Nesbitt says.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, the researchers found evidence of air sacs, as well as the descendants of the theropods, the birds.
Thanks to the airbags, the breathing of birds is more efficient than that of mammals.
At Tawa Hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of giant sauropods later also had air sacs and lightweight bones, probably the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, the researchers conclude that the lizards first appeared there.
According to this, the three lines of development separated early and spread from South America over all parts of the earth, which at that time as a supercontinent Pang<0xC3><0xA4>a formed a single land mass.
This is due to the fact that the team, together with Tawa Hallae, found the remains of two other, not very closely related theropods.
The three cannot be descended from a common immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says the Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
In his opinion, a distorted picture could result, because in South America only a particularly large number of primitive Dino fossils have been preserved, while on other continents there is hardly anything to be found.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare sideline of the reptile tribe to the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Middle Ages is still puzzling.
During the Triassic, the dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flight saurian and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread throughout the world and developed many new species, while the kinship on the border died out from the Triassic to the Jurassic.
The success story didn’t last forever.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction that the dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the other reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted so that they could beat the competition out of the field.
In any case, the success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite hit a group of animals that had also developed in the Triassic and since then has been tempted by a shadow: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or from Berkeley in California.
Lecturers from Naples are present, from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of the Frankfurt Goethe University is hitting waves worldwide.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, as well as universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police action initiated by the Bureau.
University President Werner M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Estler had cleared the building occupied by students and lecturers on the education strike last week because walls and artworks had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The damage, the signatories say, did not justify "the violent dissolution of self-organized courses of students and teachers by a police command".
The eviction constitutes an "unacceptable interference" with the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delegitimization and criminalization of protest" and diverts from the content.
The Bureau has refrained from the necessary discourse.
The lecturers call for the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage, it said.
Demonstration legitimized
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German trade union federation also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for our own future, says Verdi’s youth secretary Alexander Klein.
Hessen’s Minister of Science Eva K<0xC3><0xBC>hne-H<0xC3><0xB6>rmann (CDU) defended the action of the Unipresident and the police.
We are grateful to the President.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden Landtag.
We have an understanding of the protest, but no understanding of vandalism, says CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and the Left saw this differently.
The CDU is using painted walls to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (left).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, they were cleared.
The left has submitted a request calling on the Interior Minister to report on the police operation.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital Moscow, was in the Soviet Union a strictly guarded location for secret arms research.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Significant research and production sites for micro- and nanoelectronics are located here.
Since September 2008, Selenograd’s representatives had already established contacts with the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg – with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a "protocol on closer cooperation" in Frankfurt.
Moscow Deputy Mayor Yuri Roslyak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd led the Russian delegation, for Frankfurt was signed by planning agent Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the scientific research focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific Exchanges
It is about a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian science companies want to get orders in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include, for example, the Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the large companies Sitronics and Rosssiyskaya Elektronika.
The municipality was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planning city" for armament research.
Selenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name from the forested hilly landscape in which the research facilities are embedded.
Stuttgarter Bremsklotz
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be set high enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply about "the new heart of Europe".
S21 is much more than the laying of a train station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg’s state capital into a decade of unending construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 1980s.
Head train stations with tracks that end in the middle of the city were then considered 19th-century traffic-related fossils, which acted as brake pads for modern rail traffic, as it once took an enormous amount of time to retrain locomotives from the rear to the front.
Drive in, keep it short, keep driving - that's how it's supposed to go.
And that’s why the main train stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: a transit station, located about halfway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, on the trans-European rail line - hence the slogan of the "Heart of Europe".
S21 is now actually being approached, although the visions of the 80s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realized that it is almost priceless in the Hessian and Bavarian big city to implement the lowering.
However, main railway stations no longer have an entry and exit problem, since there are modern turnstiles with locomotives and control cars at both ends.
Nevertheless, Stuttgart 21 in addition to the ICE new construction route to Ulm is now under attack.
Local and local politicians have done it.
The railway is involved, also because it carries the risks of the largest single infrastructure project of the Republic of taxpayers and not of the state corporation.
In urban planning, the project can still be justified to some extent.
A new urban space is being created, which - it is believed the computer-generated graphics of the planners - is equipped with a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The transit station and the extension of the line are intended for passenger traffic, which - typically in the 80s - was attributed to huge growth.
At the time, there was no competition from low-cost airlines.
However, modern transport policy must first of all be about strengthening freight transport, since rail transport is significantly more environmentally friendly than by truck on the road.
However, the new construction route is not suitable for freight trains due to steep gradients.
Even more serious is the fact that S21 indirectly tangents many other railway projects.
Six billion euros are to be banned in Swabia.
That's the official number.
Experts consider ten to 15 billion to be realistic.
It is certain that in the next decade the money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
A total of sixty major projects are on the Ministry of Transport’s list.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180 km long route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built at a slow pace.
It would be urgently necessary to press the tube correctly here.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley route becomes the bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government examines verdict on airport
The state government has left open in the Wiesbadener Landtag whether it will review the decision of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to have the more than 400-page VGH ruling legally reviewed, said Minister of Economic Affairs Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Kassel had stated in writing on that day that in the event of the construction of the planned Northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport, the country would have to re-regulate the night flight ban.
The approval of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as provided by the state government, is not to be agreed with the legally required protection of the population from night-time flight noise.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether to review the ruling.
The opposition criticized this postponement and urged the government representatives to refrain from a review at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD group leader Torsten Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their promises made before the election to a night flight ban.
It’s damn hard to keep your word, Greens boss Tarek Al-Wazir said, alluding to the FDP election slogan “We keep our word.”
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel, the state government is trying to come to their night flights with "legal perversion and trickery".
A thorough legal examination takes time.
The coalition did not want to operate on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a legally sound decision, said Stefan M<0xC3><0xBC>ller (FDP).
As they represent the opposition, the statements of his faction on the night flight ban have never been.
U.S. banks pay back aid
The crisis-stricken U.S. big banks are stripping off their state bonds.
On Wednesday, the Bank of America repaid a total of $45 billion (about $30 billion) in aid from the bank rescue fund Tarp.
And Citigroup is also planning to reimburse the state aid, according to a report by the US broadcaster CNBC.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions associated with accepting the money – such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
The Bank of America had raised about $19 billion in fresh money from investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the sum out of her own cash register, which was well filled, among other things, by stock sales.
Bank manager Kenneth Lewis expressed his gratitude to the American taxpayer on Wednesday evening: the money injection had helped over a very difficult time.
The money house had risen to the height of the financial crisis with the acquisition of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to obtain money on the capital market to free itself from its liabilities to the state.
As early as Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a roughly $20 billion capital increase, CNBC reported citing circles.
A Citigroup spokesperson declined to comment.
By June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their aid.
Quick Choice
Everything went faster than I thought.
Just two weeks after the ZDF Board of Directors had pushed the acting editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster can present a successor.
Last night, the board wanted to vote on the personality.
The favorite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio in Berlin.
However, there was no confirmation from the broadcaster for this - officially, in order not to pre-empt the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role in not further damaging the ZDF-Intendant Markus Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, should this proposal not pass through the Board of Directors as well.
Frey, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 panel members.
The result of the vote has not yet been determined at the conclusion of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter had failed on his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members spoke out for Brender, seven voted against him, and Brender's election was a defeat for Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, an expected one.
The majority of the Union in the Board of Directors had already signaled weeks before the election that Brender did not want to confirm in office.
He organized the resistance against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
With the argument that under Brender the ZDF's news broadcasts had lost on-line quotas, he rejected another term of office of the highly respected editor-in-chief.
Until shortly before the election, there were protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was chanted.
More recently, 35 state lawyers had intervened in the debate, who considered Koch’s action to be unconstitutional.
It has no use.
To the person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked for S<0xC3><0xBC>dwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, initially to Today's Journal.
Subsequent stations: 1988 to 1990 personal speaker of the editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator of the "Morgenmagazin"; until 2001 head of the ZDF foreign policy; since then head of the ZDF-Hauptstadtstudio.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after the election of Brenders, who was still elected journalist of the year by the industry magazine Medium Magazin on Wednesday.
Koch’s opponent on the board, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, declared last week that countries should amend the ZDF state treaty in such a way that the lieutenant’s personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also ruled out an extract of party politicians from the ZDF’s supervisory bodies.
Brender’s likely successor, Peter Frey, had recommended a wise move to the Board of Directors – by harshly criticizing the board immediately after Brender’s election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he was able to nominate him to the post of editor-in-chief without losing his face, as well as to elect the board of directors without suspecting that a party member would take office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is assigned to the left-wing liberals anyway.
Studying is ruined
Success for the students: After a year of the education strike, the ministers of culture of the countries finally took the lead on Thursday: At a meeting of ministers of culture and university rectors, both sides agreed to improve the study conditions at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be able to complete their studies in the future.
In detail, they agreed to reduce the examination burden: in principle, each study module should only complete with a single examination.
In addition, the workload of the students is to be checked and "a realistic and justifiable measure" is to be ensured.
Politics and universities also want to simplify the recognition of examinations between universities within and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural requirements for bachelor’s and master’s degree programmes more flexible.
Moreover, there should be no deviating national regulations.
Fewer tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have carried the winged word of better studyability in their mouths.
Now, for the first time, it has been filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to reduce the number of exams in part drastically: "Each module usually finishes with only one exam," it says in a 30-page paper, which is intended to partially re-regulate the admission of degree programs.
With the "significant reduction in the examination burden", the Accreditation Board Chairman Reinhold Grimm explained, a "misdevelopment that significantly impaired the studyability" should be stopped.
In addition, the "studyability" in the future should be "the decisive criterion" in the design.
Modules such as content are "strictly to check" whether "unnecessary constraints of students in choosing the
Events" would be avoided.
The students would have "the right to receive play spaces that enable and promote self-initiative".
The rules should apply in the admission of new, but also in the review of existing courses of study.
These have to be “reaccredited” every five years – which means, however, that it takes until 2015 until all courses of study have been reviewed.
Ten accreditation agencies throughout the country are responsible for this, which are subject to the accreditation council set up by the countries.
In October, the ministers of culture had urged the countries "with emphasis" to influence the agencies in such a way that the amount of material is not too large and the examination regime is not too strict.
In some federal states, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the state ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country to date, Rhineland-Palatinate allocated additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Of the money, the universities are supposed to set up tutoring programs and strengthen student counseling, as well as examination and foreign offices.
The country and universities want to spend ten million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to bring a novella of the Higher Education Act into Parliament.
After this, only one exam is required for the completion of a study model.
The study design should be more flexible, in addition to ensuring the recognition of certificates of performance at other universities and facilitating access to the Master.
By the end of next year, all study programs in the country are to be checked for their studyability.
On Thursday, the government and opposition had again argued over the study conditions in the country.
In addition to praise, there was also criticism of the decisions.
The Federal Executive Board of the Juso University Groups demanded that the design of education policy should no longer take place "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the educational strikes, the students should now also "meet a word" as the affected.
The future academics received support from the President of the University Rectors' Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of the students," she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with whom the HRK consulted on a common reform paper.
The Education and Science Union (GEW) did not go far enough in its decisions: it requires a legal claim that allows every graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a further master’s degree program.
On the other hand, countries must ensure that there are enough master’s degree courses with the best possible study conditions available for today’s generation of bachelor’s students tomorrow, says GEW Board Member Andreas Keller.
Countries need to hire more teachers.
However, the ministers of culture did not express a free access to the master.
More than a footnote to Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller
Entering Germany and leaving is pretty much no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the lyricist Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, in which the latter, in disturbing language feats, deals with the arrival experience of a dissident who won freedom, but at the same time lost his language space.
Born in Banat, Romania in 1951, Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner had first worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as a lecturer in a children’s book publisher before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt poetry lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He caused considerable extra-literary excitement last Tuesday during a meeting in Munich, where it was "German literature in Romania in the mirror and mirror of its security files".
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner left a statement in which he confessed to fellow Romanian-German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his involvement as IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of those present, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner had won the German Language Prize in 1989.
The attempts to recruit would have begun in earnest, first in 1971.
I am, concluded S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, "so someone who has not defended himself enough against attempts of intimidation by the Securitate."
The lyricist Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is IM Walter.
Almost at the same time as the Nobel Prize for Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and its unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and in particular the community of German authors from Romania is shaken by a case that reveals the abyss and the inferiority of a political system that is based on surveillance and belittling.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is, to the best of our knowledge, not only the perpetrator, but also the victim.
In his Securitate-Act, IM Walter played a role, said S<0xC3><0xB6>llner’s confession to literary scientist Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of IM Walter for him.
He "cut it out" in all the difficult points for him at the time, according to Markel.
It is a moral need for him to make this remark.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner’s statement was unexpected in form and in front of this audience, however, it is completely surprising that the confession of a former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian intelligence service is not.
Germany had been a cozy reserve for security spitzels, Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller had already written in July at the time after reading her own file, 914 pages.
Those affected, it may be suspected, are speculated and in some cases probably also knew what the nickname was behind the nicknames Sorin, Voicu and even Walter.
In contrast to the now very procedurally secure screening of the Stasi files in this country, the handling of the legacy of security surveillance is still very diffuse.
Systematic education has been undermined and impeded in recent years.
A National Council for the Review of the Security Acts (CNSAS), corresponding to the Birthler Authority, was not established until 1999, but the issuance of the acts has since been rather sluggish.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the administration of the files.
After the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, the influence of former security members in Romania was confirmed in an interview in which a former security chief from Temesvar expressed his disdain for the winner.
She has a psychosis, after all, she was only questioned once.
The infamy of power here seemed to be able to express itself quite openly in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the S<0xC3><0xB6>llner case, as so often in connection with concealed guilt, is associated with unavoidable questions.
The thoughtful reaction of the listeners to S<0xC3><0xB6>llner’s confession makes us hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by ignorance rather than blame and shame.
To the genesis of the work of Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, it is more than a footnote.
Saturated supplement Champions League
It seemed as if there had just come a well-dressed salesman from a very nice Christmas party, on which a sporting goods manufacturer had distributed Goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of the outfitter, rose a quarter of an hour after midnight into a summoned C-K.
The man with the distinctive gleam was allowed to drive himself because of the still foreign city.
Otherwise, he would have been able to drive himself - after all, alcohol was not in the game, and drunk before luck was the 55-year-old was just as little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow the work continues.
Or just go right ahead.
In the words of the only three-day-old Swiss: “We have reached the final of the eighth round”, namely in the Champions League thanks to the 3:1 victory against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, “but we must not let ourselves be blinded by the success: it will be a brutally hard fight against the descent.”
The "much more important task" is ahead on Sunday.
Then it is necessary to repeat the royal class performance in everyday life in Mainz.
And to remove the once again revealed weaknesses after the quick three goals by Marica (5th), Tr<0xC3><0xA4>sch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Redemption
The Champions League semi-finals (16/17 + 23/24 February/ 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be played in Nyon on 18 December.
The joy of the fulminant coming of the Babbel successor was thus maintained.
Not only the supposed saviour, who in a short time had imparted self-confidence, commitment and playfulness to the uncertain Stuttgart professionals.
I approached the players and told them to think about their strengths, and I urged them to be braver, explained Soulenklempner Gross the simple-sounding recipe for success that had no effect under therapist Babbel.
He has ignited a certain magic, Babbel advocate Jens Lehmann admitted, “if there’s a new impulse in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn’t have thought possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who advanced to the best player on the pitch after weeks of injury break thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the detected "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way the new boss works: "He is a man who penetrates and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
Under Babbel, this was clearly lacking.
The VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain yet, warns Sportvorstand Horst Heldt
However, the VfB Stuttgart needs consistency above all.
Like Gross, the players and managers were careful not to overestimate the victory against a weakened and completely over-exaggerated defense of the Romanian guests.
They would also have won in Glasgow four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the evil awakening came to mind, Khedira said.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that although one goal of the season was achieved, the other was still a long way off.
We're not over the mountain yet.
The fact that Heldt was not fit to celebrate on his 40th birthday even after the first home win for three months, was due to the events of the weekend, which were freshly revived in the form of a television interview broadcast just before the start of the game by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions that others make and not the Jens, Heldt countered the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the board of leadership weakness and had decided to change coaches on the pressure of puberty fans.
Also that his free day after games had been cancelled, Lehmann regarded as a sign of lack of sovereignty and displeasure.
Lehmann's statements were "characterized by pure egoism", Heldt said back and announced consequences for the final man.
They will no longer be friends for life, the two forty-year-olds.
After all, they agreed with everyone else that without the preliminary work by the replaced coaching team, the strong performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a large share in the success," Heldt and Lehmann said unisono - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed.
World Heavyweight Championship
Hot duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson repeatedly provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the version of the WBC.
The verdict of the judges was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitali Klitschko remains the heavyweight boxing world champion.
The 38-year-old champion according to the version of the association WBC defeated the American Kevin Johnson by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109) on Saturday night in Bern.
For Klitschko it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice the world champion of the associations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn’t work out with the K.o. that everyone expected.
Klitschko expanded his record to 39 victories in 41 professional fights, twice having to beat himself because of injuries.
Challenger Johnson had to take the first defeat in the 24th battle.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, the 2.02 meter-tall Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight especially with his left hand.
Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, repeatedly evaded the World Champion’s blows, so that Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous rights to the finish line.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to get over the laps.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who went with Klitschko over the full distance of twelve laps.
Before the battle in the Swiss capital, the challenger had provided some vortex.
He insulted Klitschko as an “ugly zombie” who “cannot do anything right.”
During the weigh-in, the champion was then challenged on Friday to push Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of absence, he had beaten the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and regained his "WBC belt", which he had previously had to surrender without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreola of the United States in September.
I only got one hit in this fight and I am physically very well in shape, Klitschko had justified the quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the union of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of the associations WBO and IBF.
However, the belt of the WBA is worn by the British David Haye, after he was able to dethrone the 2.13 meter Nikolai Walyuev in November.
Haye had earlier in the summer canceled a fight planned for September against Vitali Klitschko.
It is alleged that his promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko at London’s Wembley Stadium.
Fall of Kunduz
Frontal attack from the opposition: Green party leader J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin has called Guttenberg a liar because of false information about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left demand clarification from the Chancellor.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a deliberate deception.
The minister said on the deadly bombing of two tanker trains from September "knowingly the untruth", Green Party leader J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin said on Saturday in the ARD news broadcast "Tagesschau".
It's called "landscape," he lied.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Protection Force for Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the substance of the report NATO had read to Mr. Guttenberg, Trittin said.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about the destruction of the kidnapped cargoes, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to the NATO investigation report, as many as 142 people had been killed or injured in the US air attack requested by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
Greens, SPD and Left called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government's Afghanistan policy - and whether the Chancellery, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate K<0xC3><0xBC>nast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The Chancellery did not influence the concrete actions of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were raised about the Ministry’s statement on the background to the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to the SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs correctly and fully informed about the background of the tanker attack.
Officials had said they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and had denied sensitive details to the minister.
However, the two top officials said they had even pointed to several reports from the Ministry of Defence, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
Wichert is said to have asked in a letter for clarification of the situation, reports the "Frankfurter Allgemeineer Sonntagszeitung".
He has not received an answer so far, he said.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and referred to the fact that this will be clarified in the inquiry committee of the Bundestag, which wants to constitute itself next Wednesday.
Dreamworlds
Some see images in the waking state and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It is not only the mentally ill and drug addicts who blur the lines between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything is fine.
When we lie with our eyes closed in our dark rooms, we can freely indulge in the wildest imaginations and imaginations.
However, those who experience dreamlike states in their growth, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, in the modern Western world are usually considered crazy or drug addicts, at least as speciallings.
But such images and voices do not arise only in the mentally ill or in drug addiction.
The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels sometimes cause the boundaries between dream, madness and reality to blur.
Dreamlike altered states of waking consciousness can occur in a variety of forms, at best we call them visions, at worst madness.
Although triggers and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of abduction, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions arise when the balance of the neuronal messengers of the brain - especially dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine - is derailed and the interaction of various brain parts is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusions occur very often during a schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity no longer has power over him.
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle conceived hallucinations as a form of dream in waking condition, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great similarity of the irrationality with dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "a psychosis, with all such inconsistencies, delusions, delusions".
It’s autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and quirky.
Gravity no longer has power over him, he hovers on the ceiling of the room.
He feels a kick.
Behind him winged devil figures with blood-red, distorted freckles, tooth-splitting.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, malicious voices are ringing from walls and radio.
He can no longer tolerate them, the voices that insult and offend him.
Henning T. rips two cables from the stereo system, knots them to a loop and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He climbs onto a speaker and puts the loop around his neck.
Jump.
The loop is loosening.
That's supposed to be a lesson to you, the voices in the drumming choir shout, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be healed!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychoses, the last is 2 years back, the first almost 20 years.
It was triggered by LSD.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manic-depressive, he takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and deepest desperation, he says.
The illusions are a cruel reality
About one percent of the population suffers from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is treated as the second most common disease after depression.
In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, sufferers can usually no longer distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they find themselves in a state of overexcitedness that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship or persecution.
Voice listening is especially common - voices that command, comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are also not uncommon.
The affected person can no longer separate the important from the unimportant, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like the dream, psychosis also opens the doors to a flood of ideas and fantasies that come from deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the Department of General Psychiatry at Heidelberg University Hospital.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the event, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he finds himself in a passive role, as in a dream, he is overwhelmed by the events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
It is usually not possible for them to reconcile reality, the delusions are cruel reality, excluding awakening.
Having experienced a hallucination once in your life
But unlike in the dream, Fuchs says, "the sensual and spatial structure of reality that is perceived in psychosis remains basically preserved."
The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are rooted in reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in the real context.
Why exactly our brain beats caprioles, researchers still pose puzzles.
“Exceptions can cause any person to lose their relationship to reality for a short time,” says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop a psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers assume that there is minimal brain damage in those affected.
We suspect that neuronal maturation of the brain is disturbed at an early stage of development, by a viral disease of the mother during pregnancy, for example, explains Fox.
But it remains a mystery how the disruption of the neuronal system occurs, which, moreover, does not manifest itself at all for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also trigger psychoses as they interfere with the transmitter system.
When our brain is hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and swallow expensive drugs to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get which, says L<0xC3><0xBC>beck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether deceptions are perceived as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of opinion.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, last year he evaluated his results in the book "The unreal world in our head".
Hallucinations are among the typical side effects of psychosis, but also of many other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline or depression, these often include diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s and brain trauma.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain hallucinates healthy people.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, are composed of memory contents that are usually held back.
They arise when brain areas in which sensory perceptions are processed are overactive or too little inhibited; when our brain runs hot or even when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also arousal, stress, love sadness or other mental states of exception.
In recent studies, up to one-third of respondents reported experiencing hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attending high school there.
A normal girl, actually.
If there were no pictures and voices.
In the break, it can happen that a sluggish boy with long, dark hair appeals to it.
When it answers him, the classmates look at it surprised - no one else sees or hears this boy.
They think the shy girl is a daydreamer, but Sarah K. doesn’t dream, she knows that.
She is awake, she hears and sees this boy, just as she hears and sees the girl in the bench next to her.
She can even feel his presence, at least for moments.
A pleasant feeling is that she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she sometimes asks herself.
But she knows that this boy and the other delusions are not real and disappear again.
At night, the appearances are usually frightening
Often the deceptions are also a burden.
While sitting in the classroom, she can sometimes not follow the teaching material, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just introducing a new classmate, while explaining mathematical equations for all the others audible and visible on the board.
At night, the appearances are usually frightening.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes much too rarely and much too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the pictures she sees of the freckles or the girl with the bleeding cut wounds on her arms and legs, appear before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, she screams at the figures.
Her parents and friends don’t tell her anything about what they would think of her as crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she made contact on the internet with the psychologist box, she knows exactly that she is not crazy.
Insanity is also a work of art out of desperation
If someone is socially isolated or suffering from irritable bowels, they are more likely to have hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect that the brain is then underworked and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, as a little girl was afraid of other children, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she calls Dad has not been her physical father since she can think.
Since visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain regions that also process real impressions and sounds, it is difficult for sufferers like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusions and reality. “Every experience,” says Kasten, “takes place in the brain, the reality is formed there.
Hallucinations are also images that make the brain appear, which is why they seem so real."
Even nocturnal dream images value boxing as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their delusions as unreal.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate the hallucinations as a special ability.
Boundary state between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our very consciousness-centered world, imaginary experiences are mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
A psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also carries positive, creative delusions – it is also a work of art out of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneeiroid experience form, a special form of dream-like altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroides are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams, which the experiencer considers real and which he cannot distinguish from the waking state even afterwards.
The oneioid state of consciousness occurs in trauma or disease-related extreme situations, for example in polyradiculitis patients who experience motor paralysis with full consciousness.
When a person is threatened with self- and world-loss, for example, by persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world decoupled from reality, Schmidt-Degenhard says.
A kind of borderline between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to cope with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is present in the imagination.
An intense form of meaning-making and sensibility in a situation that is inherently intolerable, which allows us humans our own ability to design, not to succumb to a nothingness of the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memory
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" as a rescue of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his consciousness goes on trips for days after heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplant, while his body is condemned to be motionless on the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunges into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who produce drugs from blood.
Taken by a Greek on a motorcycle to his home country, he surfs with his hospital bed in the snow of the Alps and meets a Korean mafioso.
He is fully awake in the imagined event, everything is real, even later in the memory.
These inner journeys differ fundamentally from any dream for Clauses.
Dream is another state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories from mental journeys are still clear to me after years and in extraneous details.
Clearer and more intense even than really experienced.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other life-world experiences, says the psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Ultimately, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations, and drug addiction show how fragile our inner images of external reality are also in the wake.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up the psychologist box, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
An experience that can also be enriching.
The snow can come
Burda
Children to take over the publishing house at the age of 27
The new publisher Kallen is an interim solution: in the long term, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his company to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
In the future, the holding company will continue to belong to 100 percent of the family.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children over the long term.
Both children inherit at the age of 27 and have the firm will to join the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We have carefully arranged the details of this.
The question of whether they are also active in the company arises only after that.
The question is also whether they are able to do so.
It is not possible to introduce 7,500 employees to their children if they are not adequately qualified.
This will benefit the children and the company as well.
Burda had announced on Thursday that he would retire from the chairmanship of the board of directors from January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
The 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the Burda board since 1999.
At first, he was in charge of technology.
Later, with the Treasury department came the responsibility for the company’s assets and after the resignation of J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Todenh<0xC3><0xB6>fer also those for direct marketing, abroad, printing and finance.
For the first time, no family member is at the top of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
The naming of kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years," Burda said.
The holding company should also be 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda said.
Regarding the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda said that even family businesses are not safe from destruction: "This always concerned families who were infected by a capital addiction, who have completely speculated and thought that they could rise to the very big player.
That was never my strategy.
He had "never had a world power dream," Burda said.
I do not see myself as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I also do not want to play in the World League with 'Time', these stores have become too big.
Perfect Beauty
Everything you want in terms of beauty and well-being is now available to you.
At least that is what El Corte Inglés has done, which recently opened a store with an area of more than 1000 m2 in the shopping center in Callao (Madrid), where everything is just about personal care.
In the wellness area, which is located on the eighth floor, you will find, among others, prestigious companies such as Hedonai, which provide laser hair removal; Spaxi<0xC3><0xB3>n, with rooms to relax and for beauty treatments; the hairdressers Luis & Tachi, Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane with their natural cosmetics.
But there is also a food department that stands out through its tea house with more than 130 different types of tea.
Enjoy a relaxing massage together with your partner while at the same time having a fantastic view of the capital, or rent for two hours the relaxation area to set up your own "beauty party" with eight girlfriends and then relax in the hot tub or with massages and a glass of champagne, these are just some of the opportunities to relax.
The total area is 250 m2, which is divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments as well as for hydrotherapy.
For example, for cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this type of equipment, in addition, there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training units of the customers and thereby offer them a completely personal training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touchscreen located opposite the devices.
After that, various videos will show you how to properly perform your training sessions.
The head of the gym assures that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching exercises) are perfectly enough to train the body muscles.
Then, after you have trained your body, even if you want to visit the hair salon, the company Luis & Tachi has a room in which treatments for the recovery of hair splendor, shine and health for your hair are offered in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the keywords for this wellness area in the middle of the city, which is always open from 10:00 am to 10:00 pm 365 days a year.
The most diverse décolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer and that is why it is a good opportunity to copy the appearance of the stars and bring their festive dresses into our wardrobe.
The shape of the décolleté, which is very important for highlighting the silhouette, is one of the points that need to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa, together with the city of Barcelona, has created the "LIVE office".
This is a project for the development and promotion of the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE-Office" (Logistics for the introduction of electric cars) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of electric cars in the city and make agreements regarding mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to summarize opinions and measures of the areas involved.
This is an attempt to push forward the means of transport of the future.
3 "electrical cities"
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities selected by the government in the MOVELE project to accelerate the introduction of the electric car.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The aim of this framework agreement is to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities are, among others, activities related to energy and, in particular, to its performance.
However, it is by no means the only initiative that Endesa participates in with regard to the promotion of the electric car.
The company participates in standardization groups throughout Europe and maintains a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees "a horizon of calm" for the automotive sector
The Prime Minister, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, prophesied of the Spanish automotive industry, which is the country's largest exporter, "a horizon of calm".
At the presentation of the economic report for 2009 by the President of the Government, Zapatero once again recalled the measures that the Government has put in place to support the automotive sector during the course of the year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the automotive industry, today we would have a panorama of the neglect and closure of some of our main production plants," he said.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the future of this industry, which is our largest export industry," he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the overall plan for the automotive industry (PIA), provided <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800 million for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn provided investments of more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 billion.
The Prime Minister explained that these investments are intended both for the development of new models, as well as for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also underlined the government's measures to boost demand, in reference to the 2000E plan, which are implemented in cooperation with the Autonomous Communities and the car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows to reduce the emissions of new vehicles sold in the Spanish market by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in approvals, which in November "increased by 40%".
On 20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
In Madrid, the first edition of the International Classic Motor Show will be held, an exhibition for professionals and lovers of the world of engines.

Skill tests with classic cars and motorcycles are also carried out on a specially designed race track in the outdoor area of the exhibition grounds.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Environmentally friendly sportiness
Mazda wants to prove that sportiness is fully compatible with the protection of the environment.
For this reason, Mazda recently introduced the Mazda3 model with the automatic stop and start system of the engine, named i-Stop, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out for its good grades in the overall picture.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its road behavior, the mechanics, the i-stop system ...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
Furthermore, the game of steering wheel is excellent.
Looking further at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, you can see that Mazda has a variety of buttons and switches in the eye-catching colors red and blue, on the same line as the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us in part of the style of the Honda Civic.
Therefore, it can easily be said that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German cars, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than ever the appropriate comfort, so that four adults can drive comfortably.
To all this comes a spacious and clearly shaped trunk.
So far, the stop and start system is only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed transmission.
This engine is a real pleasure. It stands out for its finesse, its quiet sound, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometers a year should consider this i-stop with a petrol engine because of its great comfort in the gearshift and its low consumption, even if at Mazda especially the diesel models are the best-selling ones.
With regard to the equipment, the so-called Sportive model selected for the test drive is a special feature, since it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
From the series equipment stands out above all the assistant for the lane change (RVM), which thus eliminates the dead angle, but also the controls for traction and stability, speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the on-board computer with a large screen, the sensors for parking and air-conditioning, an independent air-conditioning.
In addition, this version also includes, as if that were not yet enough equipment, the Premium package, which contains the following for an additional 1,500 euros: in addition to other elements, especially the learnable Bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD charger.
Facsimile
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, due to its driving behaviour and the variety of equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometers a year can also buy the i-stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 gasoline engine with 150 hp.
The only negative about this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury model and 23,270 euros for the tried and tested Sportive model.
In return for this high price, however, the Mazda3 offers us every day the highest driving pleasure.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars shined, dressed in models that look just as elegant as they do sexy, more than ever.
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, opted for a dark "Lady" dress.
The Promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device with which you can only read your emails without a way to see certain attachments or browse the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when it chose Time magazine as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it on the road is more unlikely, but the idea itself is still of interest to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek costs very little and has a very cheap flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After the company saw success with this, it has launched two new devices: one intended only for Twitter, the other with a lifetime free data service, quite unlike the Peek, where you have to pay a six times higher price.
Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limits as its American counterpart, but has a surprise ready.
The monthly maintenance price for the phone, about 12 euros per month, includes roaming for the whole of Europe.
Those who travel the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to give up all the data in order to be able to read their emails once you’ve crossed the border or when you’re desperately looking for a cafe with WIFI (or a way to connect with Fon).
The idea of roaming with flatrate is incredibly seductive and should have been possible for a long time.
It is true that some phone providers already offer special contracts and prices for stays abroad, but in my experience you need a doctorate in physics and good glasses to be able to read all the small print.
The European Commission’s repeated criticism of affordable roaming rates for the whole of Europe has almost always gone unnoticed.
Outside of your own country, you are always afraid to read your emails, and rightly so.
The fact that a small device like FonPeek (while it is always surprising that it has the name Fon, although it does not have Wi-Fi) can offer this type of tariff means that phone providers need to slowly but surely rethink and start considering different ways in which they can use their data network.
Kindle is another good example of this, its prices include downloading books and other requests on the Internet.
With no padding and no hooks.
This is an internet-enabled device and you only pay for it once, that is, at the time of purchase, and not month by month.
And that’s exactly what I expect from FonPeek one day, a purchase option with lifelong Internet access like Peek already offers in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I read my emails with the phone, thank you.
But I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Fetish Color of Michelle
Yellow is without a doubt the favorite color of the American First Lady.
Already at the inauguration of Barack Obama as President of the United States, she appeared in a dress and a coat of this color and has chosen the same color again to accompany him at his, no doubt, second most important moment in his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar models on both occasions: in addition to being almost the same color - a shiny green-yellow -, the clothes consisted of three parts - dress, jacket and coat made of the same fabric, and in addition, she wore something roughly embroidered or a necklace.
It even goes so far as to make it appear at first sight that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and had decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the type of fabric from which they are made.
At the inauguration, she wore a lace dress and a patterned velvet dress in Oslo.
The accessories were also different: for the first time green shoes with half-high heels and for the second time a decent model, but gold-colored.
The hairstyle was also different every time: the hair was put up as a hair wreath on this occasion, on the previous one she wore her hair open.
75% of working mothers have problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the result of the study "Fertility and Career of Women in Spain" carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute for Women.
The survey of 9,737 women between the ages of 15 and 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of working women see their career opportunities limited in the labour market due to their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are major differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children, depending on whether the women work or not and if so, what type of profession they practice.
Those of them who do no other work outside the house, work only half-days or have no fixed employment contract, are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women with a permanent job, especially in the public sector, postpone the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore also have fewer children.
“Women in the 35-49 age group with a permanent job only get their first child on average 3.7 years after contraction, a number that increases to 4.1 years for women with permanent employment who have taken longer to achieve this and who have completed their contraction and the first child much later.
In addition, the type of work also has a major impact on motherhood, albeit less than the calendar in terms of readiness to receive," explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that must be taken into account in the age of women in marriage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age at the time of marriage and the first child is the higher the level of education.
This difference was also found in women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years old, depending on whether they only have a primary school diploma or a higher education, were, on average, mothers for the first time with 25.1 or 32.1 in each case.
Furthermore, there is another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While women with a primary degree get married before their first permanent employment and have their first child, women with a middle or high school degree do just the opposite and first seek a permanent employment and marry after that and then have their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L’Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its all-envied list of ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The main actress from "Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l", one of the most elegant actresses on an international level, will thus become another famous poster like before her Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before her, the last to join this exclusive club were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millionaire").
For men, the cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's acting colleague in "Lost").
The award ceremony of the British fashion industry
The British have an important word to say in the fashion world.
Her top representatives – fashion designers and models, both from yesterday and today – met at the annual award ceremony held in London at the Royal Court of Justice.
On that occasion, they all appeared.
Ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
The Poker Game by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicente presents in "Poker of the Ace" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente) the threefold X-ray images of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, also in real life).
In doing so, he does not use a predictable and fear-inspiring genre (short biography, life and work), but looks for a similarity to the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting and Vincent does not spare himself from any horrors or enlightenments.
Besides the fact that this book is a delicious reading pleasure, it is also a moving invitation to read and read again and again.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
On Albert Camus: "In reading his pages, I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual drive, just as I have always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the unholy fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nihilist, allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a stunning poetic humor, without any sense, like the knife blade that almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was taken by this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, dermaben, in whose flesh the emotions due to adultery united with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in coming to heaven along the way of forgiveness."
About James Joyce: "The Odyssey" was published in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the 8000 summits in the world literature, you have to climb up the north wall, on the wall, where the best climbers try again and again.
William Faulkner: “It was a funny thing.
He sometimes said about himself that he would be the heir of a landowner of the county and again other times he said he would be the son of a black man and a crocodile.
Both dreams bore witness to a certain greatness.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the insane cry, which was shouted from a bridge from that personality from Munich, so that his echo echo echoed in his literary way until deep into the night of the 20th century. This he did on a journey in which he fled from himself and with a roar filled with violence.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed: my dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power so that I can finally stop writing like a woman."
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave are engraved these verses of Spencer: 'Sleep after effort, / after the storm of the harbor, / after peace after war, / after a full life one finds pleasure in death."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her luggage she always had her depressions with her.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII was spying on her between the Azaleas or singing the birds in Greek.
There is not a single other case known where the man brought up so much patience and was in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent was still much greater than her madness."
About P<0xC3><0xAD>o Baroja: "What did Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n-Santos do other than try to infiltrate Joyce into Baroja?
What did Benet intend if he did not bring Baroja to Faulkner's arms?
What did Cela do, except to destroy that man's glory, so that he could put himself on this podium?"
Feige Aggression
My 70-year-old mother walked through our neighborhood in the village of Fuenlabrada last week, when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old walked next to her and our dog, our dog is a mix that we brought from the shelter and who weighs just six kilos, and then out of the blue they passed him two feet.
Our indignation cannot be expressed at all, since it is incomprehensible to us, where there is supposed to be fun in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which of course was executed on the leash.
In addition, the suffocation that a woman who walked comfortably got when she wanted to correct these people because of the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a madman attacks a dog, he may also do the same with a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even with anyone who is deaf to him.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet neighborhood at five o’clock in the afternoon on a very ordinary Tuesday.
The dog barked all day.
Of course, we have returned an ad at a nearby police station, but we have great doubts about whether this will bring anything at all and to prevent any prejudices from the beginning, we just want to make it clear that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our outrage at what happened has prompted us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what needs to happen in the minds of these young people that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal funny, on an animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where the good education and respect for animals and people have remained.
Michelin and Fesvial together to use the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorcyclists, as both companies announced today.
This initiative aims to draw attention to the importance of wearing a helmet, since it is ultimately the only protective element that can prevent head injuries or even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which “comprises far more than just designing and manufacturing products that are becoming safer with each passing day” and further reaffirmed that they also contribute with other actions of an educational and informative nature to get one step closer to this goal each day.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, which runs under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will in a first phase distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle workshops in order to achieve the best possible distribution.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is "a constant concern" of the company, and precisely because they see themselves as a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles always committed to the fact that one of their main goals must be the development of increasingly safer products.
Sales of small trucks are on the rise again
After almost two years, the car market for small vans is finally starting to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles approved in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% in relation to 2008, and, more importantly, they are the first increase in the number of vehicles with a steady decline after 22 consecutive months, according to the figures presented by the manufacturer’s association Anfac and the car dealer’s association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are only to be enjoyed with extreme caution at present, as the reference data used for the comparison are from November 2008, which was a particularly poor marketing year with a decrease of 60 % compared to the previous year.
However, it must be borne in mind that, apart from the increase last month, the total approvals of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous fiscal year.
Since January, a total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold, but this figure includes all vehicles that make up the van market: descendants of passenger cars, pick-ups, vans, small vans and lighter vans/carts.
Furthermore, the same thunderclouds in the sky are still the ones that are most in demand, because even if some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the majority of sales go to small and medium-sized companies, which in almost 100% of all cases make the purchase with a third-party financing.
These restrictions, which are the result of the bank’s overturned monetary policy, must therefore be accompanied by other factors, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the continuation of the bad economic situation.
With this panorama and in contrast to the passenger cars, the financial support when buying a Plan 2000E vehicle has not helped much.
However, this plan is not only intended for private individuals, even self-employed and small companies have a right to it if they want to buy a small transporter up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emissions, which may not exceed 160 grams per kilometre driven, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday again, Ganvam had reminded that it is absolutely necessary for the state to pay special attention to these small trucks as well as, of course, to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Car Dealers Association predicts a similar year for 2010 as the one just past, for which it expects a sales loss (in the case of passenger cars and off-road vehicles) of 19%.
Support for braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As was the case with the ABS anti-lock braking system back then, and as is the case with the ESP stability control now, the auxiliary braking systems for emergency braking must become mandatory equipment in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly approved passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, for the remaining vehicles a grace period was set until the end of February 2011.
The measure adopted by the European Union aims to improve the protection of pedestrians, but these braking systems can also help prevent many accidents due to their operation.
The task of the emergency brake assistant is to exert more pressure on the brakes in the event of a critical brake manoeuvre, which the system detects on the brake pedal based on the brake strength performed by the driver.
However, this system does not exert this pressure until the end.
According to an investigation commissioned by the component manufacturer for the Bosch vehicles, a third of the drivers involved in an accident before the collision were no longer able to step on the brake pedal and half of them had not braked with full force.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake assist, on the other hand, engages the braking system with maximum force and thereby reduces the braking time and thus also the braking distance that a car covers during the braking process.
According to an EU study, up to 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents – it is expected that one in four accidents could be prevented with personal injury – as soon as so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects (via radar or a camera) obstacles and warns the driver, while at the same time exerting a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver reacts, the system will help increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is already unavoidable, the brake assistant applies maximum pressure to the brakes to keep the damage as low as possible.
General Motors postpones plan for Opel until January
While the staff of the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new chairman of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American vehicle manufacturer indicates that he needs more time to plan for the re-launch.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, wants to ensure that the interested party gives its consent to every single point of the plan in advance.
And for this reason, it may be that the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries in which there are works, will be postponed until the beginning of 2010.
However, GM is assured that it will make a decision on the sale of Saab in the next few days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American automaker to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in touch with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch manufacturer of the Skyper sports car, which has back cover from the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more popularity.
If none of these buyers were to come to an agreement, GM could sell some assets to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, will continue to be maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
For the development of their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers used the Boxster S as a basis and really managed to make it lighter by 80 kilos, which now only brings it to 1,275 kilos.
In order to create something like this, they were the first to dispense with the automatic folding part of the roof, which was replaced by a tent-tile wall roof with further manual drive, so that only 21 kilos were saved; thanks to the aluminum doors used in this model, such as those of the GT3 "disappear" another 15; by removing the air conditioner, a further 13 times were added to the roof.
Then, by giving up the CDR-30 audio system, they had again achieved the missing kilo by replacing the door handles with handles made of fabric.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, the test drive was carried out with a vehicle with 6-speed manual transmissions, mainly on the smaller California highways, on mountain tracks that were really very curvy.
With his driving behavior, you can only give him the mark flawlessly.
However, the reduction in his weight did not in any way mean that he would no longer be so safe on the road.
It is rather the opposite: for a long time we have not tried such a small and light model, but at the same time it gives you a feeling of great safety in the corners, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm his muscles at a low pace in the time required until we give him the commands to race, brake, recover and then get everything out of his engine again ...
The car does everything we suggest with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering, which is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
A motor sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) has been very successful and you can increase it even more with the 'sport' option as well as by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time at the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is unimaginably brutal, whether from standing out or when accelerating again.
The suspensions are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the roads on which we drove with the Boxster Spyder was already quite damaged, but the car mastered the punches well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the entire track; and that, although we found ice in the morning gray and roll split in some of these curves in the morning.
In summary, it is an ultra-light car, a car with which you have an indescribable driving pleasure, as it is probably more rare and it contains much more than just a small improvement of the Boxster Ss.
The car will come on the market in February 2010 and cost 70,831 euros.
Bag Girl
The singer, a bosom friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetology clinic Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same neck stiffness as her Chanel bags.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she is a "Bag Girl".
The Baskonia gives itself a victory in Israel
The Caja Laboral, despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, celebrated an excellent triumph with 82-91 on his visit to the complicated football field of the Maccabi Electra and thus came first in his group after the grand appearance of Mirza Teletovic, who scored with eight of the best three times.
The Vitoria team was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and teamwork, even if they had to wait until the bitter end for their victory.
The great hits from the perimeter out with 16 rated triples probably contributed to their final victory.
The game began with the lead of the Blues, who sat at the top of the ad board from the beginning.
Since the first four baskets of the team from Vitoria already came out of the perimeter, it was already possible to guess that they had come to the field with well heated wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the team from <0xC3><0x81>lava opted for an inside game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, which was received on his return to the team with whistles and applause, which is his home to further expand their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic already started to stand out as the best of his team with 13 points, even though the "minus six" rating of Splitter already hinted that this would not be the best evening of the Brazilian.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game had not yet been decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians once again that not everyone wins on their playing field, and thanks to the repeatedly attacking "Hand of Elijah" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini contributed decisively to the "Yellows" turning the rudder (50-49).
Even More Disadvantages
The team of Ivanovic, injured, but anything but dead, had to prepare a couple of game moves with accuracy to get air again and at one of them suddenly came the gun of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triples and with the support of English and Ribas made sure that on the ad board the host was able to calm down again (again)
The Alaves were bluffed in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) already announced that they would not allow anyone to take back the victory they had honestly earned in the first three minutes.
Nevertheless, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and tried to give strength to their team again by three points off the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and although Splitter was eliminated due to fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis picked up at the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being offered the forehead
Unicaja lost loudly in Greece against Olympiacos and had to give up the lead in Group B of the Euroleague to him, and that in a game that was marked by the failures of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the domestic game, which made it easier for the Greeks to win.
The team from M<0xC3><0xA1>laga was not afraid of the atmosphere in the hall of peace and friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
Thanks to their play in the first quarter, the Andalusians were able to start dreaming. An aggressive defense and three consecutive triples, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinded the hosts with 12-18 in the 9th minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the erein Unicaja, although the local team with an innings between Bourousis, Vujcic and Shortsanitis managed to score the scoreboard in the 13th minute 22-20 in their favor, the minute in which due to an action it would be almost disbanded between the two Americans and William Bever.
The Greek team began to warm up at last and its superiority on both halves of the game, while the departure of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three errors caused by Carlos Jiménez left clear marks at the Unicaja.
Among their players in the field and the Lithuanian foreman Linas Kleizas, with his triples, they increased their advantage in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up was impossible
The third quarter was marked by many attacks against the team of Olympiacos, which proved to be superior despite its 19 losses and even managed to compensate the difference of the game played in M<0xC3><0xA1>laga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn caused the leadership within the group to fluctuate.
Unicaja tried to get over the many failures and the departure of the injured Scotsman Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, in the 31st minute, thanks to the spring guidance and the triples from Cook and the use of Lewis came back some hope at 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was actually impossible because the Olympiacos, once he attacked and showed his superiority with centimetres within the basket area, could not be braked.
Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase the basket difference to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja had to give up and leave the lead atOlympiacos.
How much should you earn based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now find out their salary, which they should earn based on their profile, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads of real estate, job offers and cars in Spain.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job offers available at Trovit in Spain. Users can enter a form on Facebook in which their profession, professional experience, age and the city in which they work.
Already a week after the application was available for the first time, the search engine found that the Spanish worker on average "feels badly paid," Albert Ribera, responsible for the product, said in a press release.
The Spaniards are the worst paid according to the data Trovit has through its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer receives an annual gross salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059, in contrast to the 24,000 euros a Spaniard earns.
As a result, a truck driver has a net annual salary of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>34,247 in England, <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>25,751 in France and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest-paid job in Spain is that of a waiter with 11,592 euros a year net; followed by the work of a salesman with 14,725 euros and that of a worker with 15,667 euros.
The most sought-after jobs on the Internet in the last three months are those of a driver, part-time job and social worker.
Brazil calls Zelaya a date to leave
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President, who has been removed from office, must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his mandate officially expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" was aware that before that date he must have left the embassy in which he had found asylum since September 21.
"He is aware that he has to leave on January 27 as his mandate expires on that day and he has to look for a new accommodation."
The broadcaster also quoted the former president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the scheduled date: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil," Zelaya said on the phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, this week he tried to take refuge in Brazil.
Zelaya's refusal to recognize the status of an asylum-seeking politician whom the "de facto" government, under the presidency of Roberto Micheletti, wanted to impose on him failed.
Thank you!
After the most enticing days since last spring, when asset inflation was the predominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is by no means surprising, as this is their natural state, in an environment where brokers make decisions about a naturally uncertain future.
The measure used to stabilize the markets was to settle the debts with the direct purchase of assets and to leave the liquidity free indirectly at interest rates that move around zero, so that the banks buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of assets are almost finished and, without calling into question their heterodox liquidity policy, begin to scatter some sand into the gear, as the ECB already predicted with its annual auction, taking place next week.
Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures, and we are witnessing a reversal in the reduction of risk premiums.
The volatility of the exchanges and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, even if they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to nationalize private risks and public debt was rising again.
Quality is once again the focus, and the USA, Japan and Germany are the preferred haven for investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences of the eurozone countries with regard to Germany.
Spain had hardly been affected by this episode of instability until now, but then Standard & Poor's came along and threatened to downgrade Spain's rating with a new revision.
On the other hand, some uncertainty does not harm to silence the defenders of moral risk, who should have tried again to create in the leaders of world economic policy an awareness of what they had caused, since they had the devastating effects that the restriction of credit had led to the abandonment of work.
Nevertheless, what has happened in Dubai points to a tribal war between the Emirs to restore power in the Emirates and the development in Greece has been predicted even earlier.
A government that ignores public debt, elections, and a new government that moves in the same direction.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and S<0xC3><0xB3>crates in Portugal to Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on its foreign payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro member state to no longer fulfil its obligations.
On the other hand, it makes sense that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to oblige its citizens to take extraordinary measures in order to maintain the stability of state funds.
Yes, we are as expected before an episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some deviations to too high amounts, this would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the differences in public debt increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
However, if European differences were to diminish and the Spanish continue to increase, this would be a special Spanish risk.
That of Standard & Poor's is a farce. While the local preferred indicators force a large part of the market research institutes to prefer their scenarios for recovery and to correct their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, which again with a Japanese scenario does not provide long-term prospects for the economy.
Again, it seems that it is an excellent opportunity to buy Spanish shares, although at the moment "caution when driving" is in demand.
Connected Branches
Iberdrola President Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n was the first to appear before Parliament's subcommittee yesterday, where the strategy on Spain's energy supply is being debated in these days over the next two decades.
After his appearance, which was followed by Gas Natural-Fenosa chairman Rafael Villaseca, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n gave the press some points about what he had submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to Iberdrola’s chairman, Spain will have to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion euros from that date until 2030, on the condition that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the investments needed would not amount to 60 billion, but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that we should no longer invest in increasing energy production capacity, but in distribution networks and international allies.
From 2020 the question will change and you should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with facilities for capturing carbon dioxide and, of course, especially on renewable energies.
In this case, he assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, under the prerequisites of course by other "support energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes that the bill for a sustainable economy, which has just been passed by the government, is in line with what his company has demanded, by no means wanted to say anything against this law, how to create incentives for national coal use, which would be the exact opposite of all policies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, "in the long term, this direction is clearly set, despite some "individual" measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola called them.
Be that as it may, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that investment decisions should already be made now, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" of Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for ground-based airport services, Swissport, is the preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for baggage services at ten European airports where they are represented.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, to which no figures have been announced so far, is set for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the government of Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares yesterday signed a protocol for cooperation in order to create an innovation center for intelligent infrastructures.
The alliance plans investments of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be the study of energy efficiency at highways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first motorway construction in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which they are already represented as energy and water companies.
The building in question is a tunnel that will cost $1.7 billion (approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, on the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The city council wants the construction to be completed by the end of 2014.
After the Public-Private Cooperation Administration (PPP) decided to advance the project according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for construction and toll administration.
In anticipation of the offers presented in May, the estimated investments amount to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.047 billion euros), with in the last phase three consortia, mainly consisting of European construction companies, competing with each other.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first company is one of Australia’s largest construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists for civil engineering.
Acciona’s team is joined by the Northern Direct consortium, formed by the British company Laing O’Rourke, the Australian Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure, and the French construction company Bouygues.
The third and final consortium, which is in the narrower election, is called LBRJV, formed from the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), the also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specializes in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises massive construction and privatization, but it has a hurdle to overcome as you only gain access through the purchase of a local construction company.
A strategy that the aforementioned companies have followed high-pitched or bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be pursued by the Spanish construction giants.
Even ACS has gained access to this market only through its participation of 30% in Hochtief, owner of the said Leighton.
Millions of assets
Acciona relies on this geographical area of utmost importance for the industry, in which it is already very well known due to its activity as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest wind farm (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies commissioned to build and manage Adelaide’s desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate itself in these two areas and use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure branches.
The subterranean toll route, which will be funded by the City of Brisbane’s Infrastructure Office and will link Northern Link (Nordzubringer), has the purpose of connecting the western highway in Toowong with the bypass road in Kelvin Grove (see map) on a length of 5 kilometers across the bridge to connect the bridge with each other.
The timetable issued by the city administration provides for the award for summer 2010 and the start of construction work in December next year.
Although this toll line is expected to open to traffic in the last months of 2014, it is expected that construction work will continue until 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government is involved in the financing with 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros).
For Hochtief, Brisbane is already a big business.
Australia is awarding significant contracts to Hochtief, which signed a contract with the government of 154 million yesterday.
The ACS subsidiary will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fiber-optic cables through its local subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will create fast Internet access for 400,000 people and employ the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has received the construction project of the King George Tower with 27 floors in the Australian city of Brisbane. The construction work has not yet begun and has received a total of 129 million for this.
Also in the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it competes with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools over 25 years.
The initial investment amounts to 75 million euros.
FCC Receives Order for a Tunnel in Slovenia for $64 Million
The FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has secured the construction of a 2.1-kilometer tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for the sum of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after it received the contract for the construction works to expand the Bosruck tunnel (Austria) over 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore receives advertising from Renfe
Renfe has attributed the advertising and marketing services for the next two years to the agency Mrs. Rushmore for a sum of approximately three million euros annually, the railway company said.
In this contract there is also the possibility of two extensions of 12 months each. Ms Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies that presented at this competition advertised by Renfe, of which 4 came to the final round, including TBWA, which has been responsible for advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of designing and producing the campaigns.
France Télécom fined over $63 million for shutting down competition.
France’s competition regulator has imposed a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million on France Télécom for anticompetitive behaviour in the country’s Caribbean territories.
According to the Authority, the telephone provider has restricted competition on landlines and mobile phones by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has collected more than 560 million euros in penalties since 1994 for hindering its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased, as the authority that oversees the competition is of the opinion that France Télécom has committed similar violations in the past and has therefore reverted.
Application trading
On the other hand, the subsidiary of the French company has followed the example of other telephone providers and has opened an application trading page on the Internet in order to increase revenues from businesses that do not originate from the telephone connection.
Basically, this website of Orange is active in France and the United Kingdom.
One has to wait until 2010 until these sites will also be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The Champions League game has brought Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a 476.4 million since its inception.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has developed into a source of income for the football club.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken in 476.4 million, bringing them the third and fifth place of the football clubs that have earned the most money in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League not only brings glory, it is also one of the main sources of income of the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (of which 12 are Spanish) that have participated in this event since its foundation in the 1992/1993 season.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The Wei<0xC3><0x9F>e Club is the third largest club in Europe, earning the most money from its participation and the only one to have won the trophy three times in addition to AC Milan.
The reigning Catalan champion and the last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 took fifth place.
The list leads Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also earned the most money through their participation in the previous Champoins League.
And that, even though they lost against Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only in third place of the countries that were able to raise money through the Champions League, although it has more titles than all the others (five, as opposed to four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This obvious contradiction is explained by the complicated money-sharing procedure that UEFA applies.
In this fiscal year, the organization, chaired by Michel Platini, expects revenues of 1,090 million through the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA expects 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that participated in the qualifying round (among them Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who took part received 3.8 million by their bluffing presence, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they contested.
There is also a bonus for winning (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and a draw (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 per team). The clubs that have reached the quarter-finals will each receive three million; the four that have reached the quarter-finals will receive 3.3 million.
The last four will each receive $4 million.
The winner earns 9 million, as opposed to the second, who receives 5.2 million.
Thus, a football club receives at least 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million in fixed income.
Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a, in turn, earned 2.5 million euros with his victory in the European Super Cup in August.
However, there are also the variable payments, for which 337.8 million are provided.
This money is allocated in proportion to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 allocated places.
The last year’s champion receives 40% of the allocated money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third place and 10% for the fourth place.

Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa group yesterday leaked details of the offer to buy shares, with which it wants to acquire an upper limit between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage that does not force them to make a public tender (OPA) due to the number of shares.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5025 per share, which is paid out over ten years and with an interest rate of 1% per year due to this shift.
Yesterday, the Sos shares closed at 1.85 euros, which is why Nueva Rumasa values the company 18% below the market value.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real rating of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 consultants.
The Jeréz group gives shareholders 15 days to express their interest in the sale of their shares.
CNMV assured that it had not been informed of this offer, although the company Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the authority.
At closing, the deposit would amount to 611.7 million, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its management.
In an attempt to stay on the sidelines of possible purchase offers and the litigation of his former managers, the brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar announced the appointment of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as head of internal audit.
A decision that makes her the first woman to hold a high position at the food company.
This is a newly created post, which is directly under the chairman of the group.
This is anything but free from controversy because the company is involved in a court battle over the suspicion of diverting more than 230 million Sos to other companies of the Salazar family.
It cannot be ruled out that Sos will shift further capital over the next few months.
With regard to Salazar’s loan, former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the postponement of 212 million without knowing their purpose.
CNMV approves Paternina’s public tender submitted by investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public tender for Federico Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer on 9 October.
The Authority stated that it had approved this tender after it had been demonstrated that the conditions were in accordance with the law and that the content of the explanatory memorandum submitted, following the amendments of 2 December, could therefore be considered ‘sufficient’.
CNMV has also announced that this offer is aimed at the acquisition of 550.008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, which in turn is 8.95% of the company’s capital, which consists of 6,142,786 euros in shares approved on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
In addition, it was informed that 5,592,778 million shares have been fixed, which cannot be transferred in any way until the closing of the tender and whose price was set by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws in force.
New programmes for the assessment of vehicles
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the car repair shops deserve
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are towed to workshops where an appraiser must assess the damage and repair costs incurred.
No single accident is the same and calculating the cost of parts and hours of work can be a lengthy and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros per hand, including the parts and working hours, can take up to two or three hours.
On the other hand, with the support of the latest computer science tools, it is a matter of minutes
That is why almost 100% of the reviewers use this type of system.
Service and application providers for accident assessment and repair collect the information they receive from manufacturers to process it afterwards and offer it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American group Solera, is the market leader; 80% of all reviews are produced with their products.
The two other companies competing with in the tool market for review and preparation of a report are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is anything but easy.
According to Eduardo Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, sales manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is becoming increasingly large, to the point that in the last five years even more versions, variants and motorizations have come to market than in the entire fifteen years before.
As soon as a new car comes on the market, work begins for the companies.
It is a laborious task, because every single one of the thousands of vehicle parts must be catalysed and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If it is a much sold model, the work can be completed in a week if the procedure proceeds quickly.
If it is a less common car, it can already take up to three or four months. Audatex currently has full information on 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the more exclusive models, for example, they have information about the Porsche models, but not about Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to the fleet of vehicles driving on the roads, it is over 99%.
Audatex has eight centres worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, the USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) to carry out the documentation work and to produce databases, each of which specialises in specific brands.
The national headquarters is located in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Every month, they record 2.5 million data and their customers receive updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information allows companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is the use for repairs and repairs, but depending on the country, there are also tools for the management of scrap parts or for calculating the incorrect or residual value of a car.
The only company that informs about a driver about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this offer in Spain, but in the United States.
By reviewing the products Audatex offers, you can easily get an overview of the type of support it provides to industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, where the star of the products is AudaPlus, a standard solution for assessing accidents for the reviewers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles as well as light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times estimated by the manufacturer or the painting prices.
This tool is paid depending on the purpose of use, i.e. for each opinion.
The most expensive will be for customers who rarely use it, a maximum of ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
On the other hand, every insurance company that makes thousands of reviews negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, it is possible to fully identify a vehicle and the equipment with which it ran from the assembly line using only the chassis number.
AudaGlass deals with the vehicle windows, and AudaSubastas is an internet service that is open to the specialist market and can be used to provide services for vehicles that have been declared to be in total damage.
Your statistics service is very useful in identifying trends, conducting geodemographic analyses or for obtaining information about the deviations by brand and model.
For example, you can examine how many models of a particular car brand had to go into the workshop due to breakdowns or how many of them were involved in a serious accident in a certain period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tools.
It distributes among others Gt Estimate, which is also intended for reviewers and in the same way provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official working hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns and maintenance of vehicles.
The GT guide for expert opinions is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 reviewers and 53 insurance companies.
Their business volume has increased by 20% annually over the last three years and in 2008 sales amounted to 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, they also started to go on the international market with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in 1966 in Germany and established in 1979 in Spain.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its business is done in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in North and South America, working together with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
Total worldwide sales of Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) amounted to $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company has revenues of 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock exchange and today its shares are trading at a value of $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and part of the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Auction of accident cars on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought a platform on the Internet for the sale of accident vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase meant the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company’s capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value increase, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This review and purchase service is exclusively aimed at industry professionals, such as insurance companies, reviewers, car rental companies, workshops, scrapyards and car dealers, who must register before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
Today, the site has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
Every day, 3,000 ads are managed and 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a vehicle whose chassis number has been deregistered may no longer drive on the roads, but certain undamaged parts may be used as spare parts.
On the other hand, cars with a historical value may be allowed again, even if they have been unregistered after difficult government procedures.
Cost estimate of the workshop in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the company Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps: identification of the vehicle, search for the spare part, creation and creation of a cost estimate.
The easy handling of these systems is a fundamental condition, especially in order to convince the older professionals who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer techniques.
The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are passenger cars, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an internet connection to use it.
After the model to be repaired has been identified using the chassis number, a graphic of the respective model appears and then the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables, such as the price for the working hours, surcharges or discounts and after that he can have the cost estimate printed and passed on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a review tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that the workshop does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros per year, an amount that the customer can immediately pay.
At the moment, the company Audatex is working on offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for for a long time, since you can choose a door with it, for example, and then turn the picture completely to look at the inside.
