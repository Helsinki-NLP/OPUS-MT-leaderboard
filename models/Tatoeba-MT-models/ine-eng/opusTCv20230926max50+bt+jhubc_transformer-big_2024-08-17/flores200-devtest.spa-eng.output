USA Gymnastics endorses the U.S. Olympic Committee’s note and recognizes that it is imperative that the Olympic family foster a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC’s statement that the interests of athletes, clubs and their sports can be served more appropriately if significant changes are made within our organization, rather than certifications being withdrawn.
USA Gymnastics supports an independent investigation that can shed light on how the abuse of the proportion that Larry Nassa’s survivors described with so much courage could have gone unnoticed for so long and accepts any necessary and appropriate change.
The goal of USA Gymnastics and USOC is the same: to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their dreams in a protected, positive and empowered environment.

In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs were feathered, an already widespread theory, it also offers specific data that fossils usually do not offer, such as their color and three-dimensional structure.
According to specialists, this animal has a plumage of brown color in the upper area and a pale or carotenoid shade in the lower part.
Also, the finding makes it possible to better understand the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the plumage of dinosaurs does not have a well-developed axis, called the rickshaw, but does have other feather features (pigs and barbulas), the researchers concluded that the rickshaw is likely to be the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the plumage suggests that its function was not related to flight, but was used to regulate the temperature or as an indicator of it.The researchers argue that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample analyzed presents features of the plumage of an adult and not of a chick.
The experts’ appreciations were that, even when it comes to the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample illustrates more the plumage of an adult than that of a chick.

While it was an eminently theoretical work, the program was written in order to simulate the observations made to the Sagittarius galaxy.
It would be the tidal forces between the dark matter present in the galaxy and that of the Milky Way that would cause the effect expected by the group of scientists.
The Milky Way influences the Sagittarius galaxy in the same way that the moon exerts an attractive force on our planet and causes tides.
Experts came to the conclusion that dark matter affects each other just as regular matter does.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around it in a halo class and is composed of numerous small particles.

Extremely resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was first detected by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African area of Zululand.
During an interview, he noted that the new variant generated “a lot of concern and alarm, given its high mortality rate.”
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have contracted the virus inside the hospital and that at least two of the infected were health workers at that hospital.
In one year, an infected person can infect between 10 and 15 people with whom they have had close contact.

In France, elections have traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a cubicle and enter a pre-printed sheet on an envelope indicating the candidate they have chosen.
After the officials corroborate the identity of the candidate, the candidate enters the envelope in the ballot box and signs the list of voters.
The French electoral law establishes the procedures quite strictly.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes have to be transparent, allowing voters and observers to verify that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that there are no additions other than those of those who vote, duly computed and authorized.
Candidates have the power to send representatives to control each stage of the process and, overnight, volunteers count votes under strict supervision and in accordance with specific procedures.

To me that didn’t make sense; it definitely wasn’t fair.
All I'm telling people is that you treat us the same way we treat you.
A bill was passed by California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, which does not allow violent video games to be sold or rented to minors.
The bill provides that violent video games sold in the state of California must be labeled with a decal with the legend “18” and penalizes their sale to minors with a fine of $1000 for non-compliance.
Attorney General Kier Starmer QC made a statement this morning informing that Huhne and Pryce would be taken to trial.
He has resigned, and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. Norman Lamb MP is expected to assume the position of Minister of Business that Davey leaves vacant.
February 16 is the date on which Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates Court.
Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback, 25, 21 years old, died at the wheel.
Edgar Veguilla suffered injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider needed facial reconstruction surgery.
Uka's gun jammed as he pointed at a fifth man's head. Schneider suffers permanent pain, does not see with one of his eyes, he lacks a part of the skull and his face had to be rebuilt with titanium.
Schneider testified through a virtual link from a U.S. Air Force base in his home country.
Carpanedo participated in two individual championship races apart from Wednesday's competition.
The first was the slalom, in which he won a "Not Finished the First Race", as did 36 of the 116 participants in that race.
In his other race, the giant eslalon, took tenth place in the women's group of seats with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes behind the first Austrian finalist, Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes below the ninth finalist, Gy<0xC3><0xB6>ngyi Dani, of Hungary.
Four seated skiers failed to complete their races and a total of 45 participants from 117 of the Giant Slalom did not reach the qualifying stage in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police force was able to recover the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya said: “We have arrested five individuals who abused the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop.”
Baba, Bhutha, Rampro, Gaza and Vishnu Kanjar are the accused.
According to police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the home at the time of the car’s impact, none of them suffered injuries.
However, the driver suffered serious injuries to his head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed as emergency services pulled the driver of the red Audi TT out of its interior.
At first, he was transferred to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been on the Edinburgh County Courthouse, charged with the murder of her son.
While she is in custody pending prosecution and trial, any statement by an eyewitness may be questionable, as her image has been widely disseminated.
It is a common practice in other regions of the UK, but as Scottish justice works otherwise, the courts considered the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said: “Journalists seem to be walking on dangerous ground when they publish photos or other information of suspects.”
The Crown Office, which is in charge of the prosecutions, pointed out to journalists that no further comment would be made at least until the prosecution car was dictated.
According to leaked information, the document will deal with the border conflict, which Palestine intends to resolve on the basis of the limits in force prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were also addressed, as reported, include the future state of Jerusalem, which both nations consider sacred, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley for ten years once the agreement is signed, while PA only accepts five.
During the complementary pest control trial, the rangers were required to closely monitor the shooters, as the shooter was monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
In a union between NPWS and the Association of Sports Shooters of Australia (NSW) Inc., suitable volunteers were recruited into the Association of Sports Shooters’ hunting program.
Mick O'Flynn, who is provisionally in charge of the NPWS Park Conservation and Heritage Office, said comprehensive safety training and training was provided to the four shooters chosen for the shooting operation.
Yesterday, Martelly swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
In four years, it's Martelly's fifth CEP.
Last month, a presidential commission advised the previous CEP to step down, as part of a series of measures that seek to lead the country to new elections.
The commission was the way Martelly responded to the widespread demonstrations that began in October against the regime.
The demonstrations, sometimes violent, were provoked by the fact that no elections are held, in some cases since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with overheating and operation problems have been reported, causing six fires and causing minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company categorized as “non-serious.”
The ministry spoke in relation to the delay in Apple’s report, saying it was something “truly regrettable.”
Mariana was shaken by an earthquake at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 a.m. GMT) on Friday.
The Northern Mariana Islands’ emergency management agency said there was no record of damage in the national territory.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported the absence of tsunami indicators.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former police officer from that country hijacked a bus and held captive tourists coming from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 against foreign visitors.
Several hostages have been rescued and, so far, at least six have been confirmed dead.
Both the six hostages, including children and the elderly, and the Filipino photographers, were released early.
Later, the photographers took the place of an elderly woman because she needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed the same path as his father and began studying medicine.
He received training in obstetrics and entered the National Women’s Hospital of Auckland in 1959.
Liggins began her research on preterm labor in her spare time while working in the hospital.
Their study showed that the baby’s fetal lung maturation could be accelerated through the administration of a hormone.
Xinhua reported that on Wednesday government investigators managed to retrieve the flight recorders from the black box.
Luna’s fellow fighters also paid tribute to him.
Tommy Dreamer said: “Moon was the first queen of the Extreme. She died the night of the two moons, something unique, like her. A strong woman.”
Dustin Gold in Powder Runnels stated: “Moon was as rare as I was; even more so. I love it and will miss it. I hope it’s in a better place.”
Since 2008, there has been an 8 per cent increase in those who oppose Australia becoming a republic among the 1,400 polled ahead of the 2010 federal election.
Julia Gillard, acting prime minister, argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that Australia should become a republic once Queen Elizabeth II's term ended.
34% of respondents share this view and want Elizabeth II to be the last queen to have Australia.
At one end of the survey, 29% thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible; at the other, 31% thought it should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist had to swim in the freestyle of 100 meters and 200 meters, and in three reliefs at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition has been questioned following his complaints.
It has not been possible to take pain-relieving drugs, because their use in the Games is prohibited.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known.
Many people checked the find using various types of hardware and software and at the beginning of February and it was released on Tuesday.
Comets may have served as a source of water for our planet, as well as organic matter, which has the ability to form proteins and sustain life.
The expectation of scientists is to understand how planets, in particular ours, originate, given that comets crashed into Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took over as governor at the start of the year and last month signed a bill that allows people of the same sex to marry.
He called the rumours “political talk and gossip.”
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the Federal Aviation Administration, would reduce the distances of air routes, which would save millions of gallons of fuel per year, as well as carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, in contrast to old ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to detect aircraft more accurately and provide more accurate data to pilots.
No additional transportation will be implemented and trains will not be stopped at Wembley, and parking for cars and the deterrence will not be available.
Due to the concern generated by the possible lack of transport, the possibility of the game being played behind closed doors was considered, without the fans of the team.
On Thursday, the journal Science reported an investigation into the appearance of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Experts from Princeton University in the U.S. and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species managed to evolve in just two generations, even though it was estimated that it would take much longer, due to reproduction between an endemic Darwin's tweezer, Geospiza fortes, and a tweezer of cactus, Gespiro.
Gold can take all kinds of forms and roll into tiny figures.
Not only can it be hammered and wound into sheets, but it is also possible to stretch it until a very thin wire can be twisted and braided.
It can become very thin and adhere to another metal. Such is the thinness that can be achieved that was used to decorate the hand-made illustrations in books called “illuminated manuscripts”.
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make a pH indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice will be altered depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the analyzed chemical determines its pH level.
Hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron, so a hydrogen ion is the result of stripping a proton of its electron.
Shake both dry powders together and, after doing so, with your hands sanitized and moist, extrude them to form a ball.
There will be a reaction between the moisture in your hands and their outer layers, which will feel strange to the touch and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, which were connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
In some homes in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece, traces of sewer systems were found.
They also had toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China; in Roman civilization, public toilets had toilets, and some were shared by men and women.
When you communicate with someone who is thousands of miles away, you are making use of a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space, as the light from Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and view we have.
A giant rocket, more than 100 feet high, is needed to carry a satellite or telescope into outer space.
The wheel has changed the world in surprising ways. The most important thing it has done for us was to provide us with a much simpler and faster transport.
Thanks to it today we have many means of transport, such as the railway or the car, among many others.
Below, there are more moderate-sized felines that feed on medium prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including independent domestic cats) that feed on small species that exist in much greater numbers, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of its success is the niche concept: each feline has a particular function, which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most socializing felines and their lives take place within large groups called herds.
The herds consist of one to three adult males from the same family group, joined by up to thirty females and their young.
Usually, females are closely related to each other, making them a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds have the same behavior as wolves or dogs, with whom they keep a striking similarity (unlike the other big cats) both in their behavior and in that they are highly lethal to their prey.
An integral athlete, the tiger has the ability to climb (but not too well), swim, make extensive jumps, and pull five times stronger than a robust person.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These are the only four felines capable of emitting roars.
The roar of the tiger is not a full-sounding roar like that of the lion, but rather like a prayer of words spoken to grunts and screams.
Ocelots enjoy feeding on small creatures. If possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds. Almost all of their prey will be much smaller than their own.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (preys) through the smell, smelling the soil where they have passed.
They have very good night vision and in dark places and, in addition, they move very stealthyly. The ocelots hunt their prey mimicking their surroundings and then swing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) moves away from the main one they come from (for example, if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they can’t easily retreat) they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they used to be used to.
The new environment has different resources and competitors and, therefore, a new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it had before to be a strong competitor.
There have been no changes in the original population, which still need the same adaptations as in the past.
As time passes, as the incipient population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that it will not be possible to classify them as of the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the development of new species, and is an inevitable consequence and fundamental part of evolution.
Plants generate the oxygen that people breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that they exhale.
The food of plants is generated with solar energy, thanks to photosynthesis. In addition, they offer us shade.
We build our houses from plants and with them we also make clothes. Most of the food we eat are plants. Without them, the animals would not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of his time, therefore, he feared nothing but others of his own species.
His long jaws had more than 70 sharpened teeth embedded as knives, in addition to another additional group in the palate, which means that anything that happened in front of him, had no escape.
We don’t have the safety, but he could have had viperin. His diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurids, and even he could have been a cannibal.
He also attacked any creature that entered the water: not even a dinosaur as huge as T. Rex was a threat to him.
While most of that food would seem quite familiar to us, the Romans also ate certain unconventional items at banquets, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails and even a type of rodent, the liron.
Another thing in which they differed was that humble people and women ate sitting in a chair, while the wealthy enjoyed sharing banquets and taking sides while eating.
It is not possible that recipes from ancient Rome included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
Verbigracia, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa and no ancient Romans ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a central temple considered their home.
People carried sacrifices for the gods and priests sought to meet the needs of those celebrating ceremonies and festivals.
The temples have an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
At times, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to form part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for his deity.
In the middle of the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not of greater importance.
The Hebrew families spent most of their time outdoors.
The women were cooking in the yard; the shops were just counters facing the street. The houses were built with stone.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests; therefore, wood was extremely expensive.
According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland by homicide and, during a journey that took him further west, discovered the island and gave it its name.
Even so, without prejudice to their discovery, the Eskimo tribes already inhabited the place for that time.
While each country separately was “Scandinavian,” there were marked differences in relation to the people, monarchs, habits, and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you may believe that a map of the treasure was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that is not true. While the back of the document contains something written, it is not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence has the phrase “Original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776” written on its reverse. The text is at the bottom of the document, face down.
Although it is unknown for certain who wrote it, it is known that it was barely made, the huge parchment document (measured 293<0xE2><0x81><0x84>4 inches by 241<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 inches) was rolled up to be saved.
Therefore, it is likely that the annotation has been added only as a label.
Although the landings carried out during D-Day, as well as the subsequent clashes, had achieved the liberation of northern France, the southern side still remained.
His government was in the hands of the French of "Vichy", who were a group that, in 1940, had agreed peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the so-called "Operation Dragon" was deployed, through which the Allies invaded southern France.
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces had achieved the liberation of southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization can be defined as a specific culture in which an extensive group of people live and work together; that is, a society.
The term civilization derives from the Latin civilis, which means civil, and is related both to the word civilis, from the same language, which means citizen, as well as to civitas, whose meaning is city or city state and which, moreover, determines in some way the size of society.
State cities are the forerunners of nations. A culture of civilization entails a prolonged generational transmission of knowledge, a lasting cultural legacy and a homogeneous spread.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical traces, and fail to be recognized as civilizations proper.
During the War of the Revolution, the thirteen states formed, at first, a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, in which the Congress was its only component.
The Congress had no power to fix taxes, and since it had an executive or national judiciary, such a function fell to the authorities of the states, which often did not cooperate to enforce all their laws.
Nor was it entitled to annul tax laws or tariffs between states.
The articles demanded the unanimous approval of all states to proceed with their amendment and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives used to be absent.
The Italian national football team, together with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the sports that are most practiced are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, skating and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in northern areas, with athletes participating in international tournaments and Olympic events.
There are about 7,000 islands in Japan (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the globe.
Because of the conglomerate/group of islands it contains, Japan is often referred to as an “archipelago” from a geographical point of view.
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when sailors from Europe who sailed through the place recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, that is, beautiful island.
The establishment, in 1624, by the Dutch East India Company, of a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiated a transformation in the aboriginal method of grain production, employing Chinese labor to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing Dynasty army (1644-1912) took control of the northern and western coastal region of Taiwan in 1683 and declared the latter as a Qing Empire dependent province in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated during the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government acceded to the Shimonoseki Treaty, through which it ceded Taiwan's sovereignty to Japan, which retained its control over the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three capital constructions: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and that of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the ends of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can visualize how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had already been restored and work is still ongoing.
For example, the most common fixed-image photography format globally is that of 35 mm, which was the most widely used film size towards the end of the analog film era.
Today it is still produced, but the most important thing is that its dimensional relationship was transferred to the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Indeed, the 35 mm format is somewhat confusing, as its dimensions are 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Therefore, it is said that the dimensional ratio of this format (dividing by twelve in order to calculate the simplest ratio of integers) is equal to 3:2.
Many typical formats (verbigracia, the group of APS formats) are the same or closely resemble this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which has been the subject of constant mockery and often ridicule, is a simple guideline that generates dynamism while allowing to give a certain order to the images.
It indicates that the most effective position where to place the central object is the intersection that is formed between the horizontal and vertical lines that divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this phase of Europe’s history, the Catholic Church, which had accumulated wealth and power, was questioned.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had succeeded in uniting European states despite their different languages and customs.
Its power, present everywhere, affected everyone, from the monarch to the plebeian.
One of the most important principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds are reserved for that specific function.
The central dome of the church had remained in Rome for more than a millennium and this concentration of power and money made many wonder whether this principle was being respected.
Shortly after hostilities broke out, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
While the strategy, which involved the interruption of vital military and civilian supplies, was successful, it violated international law generally recognized and contemplated in several international agreements of the last two centuries.
Britain extracted international waters in entire sectors of the ocean to block the entry of ships, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
Having received a reduced response against this tactic, Germany thought it would face a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
Throughout the 1920s, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was that of pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities that occurred during the First World War, countries wanted to prevent such a situation from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the U.S. to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents, a book of poems and a recommendation note made by Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of delimiting different periods of time. Each stage or each family in power constituted a different dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there was also a period of instability, with provinces divided; the best known was that of the Three Kingdoms, which developed over 60 years, between the Hhan dynasty and the Jin.
During these stages, a bloody war broke out between many nobles who disputed the throne.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of Ancient China was that of the Three Kingdoms, where thousands of people died in a struggle to occupy the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
There are many political and social consequences, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single sovereign.
Also, after the Revolution, the posts were open to all male candidates, which allowed the success of the most ambitious and prestigious.
The same goes for the military, as instead of basing the army’s charges on classes, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other people of the oppressed working class in other countries to face their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues beyond this worldly life. He used to visit a cave that became known as “Hira” on the mountain of “Noor” (light) to reflect.
The cave itself, which lasted over time, very realistically illustrates the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
At the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca lies a cave completely abstracted from the rest of the planet.
Indeed, it is very difficult to find, even if one was sure of its existence. Inside the cave, the isolation is total.
Nothing can be seen but the wonderful clear sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. From the inside of this cave, you can see or hear very little of this world.
Of the seven wonders, the only one still standing is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, erected by the Egyptian people in the 3rd century B.C., is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built to venerate the deceased pharaoh.
The Meseta de Giza, or "Giza Necropolis", in the Valley of the Dead, in Egypt, contains numerous pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many other such smaller tombs and temples were erected in honor of his wives and relatives.
The "arc up" mark resembles a V and the "arc down" mark is similar to a staple or square without its lower edge.
Above means you must start at the tip and push the bow, and below means you must start at the frog, where the hand holds the bow, and pull from it.
The upward movement of the arc generates a softer sound, while a downward one is stronger and sharper.
Feel free to make your own pencil marks, but don’t forget that the marks on the bow instruments have been printed there for a musical purpose and should therefore be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market women forced the terrified monarch Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, her two young sons (Mary Theresa, eleven years old, and Louis Charles, four years old) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd who shouted and threw threats against the king and the queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to completely open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a participant in the revolt shook the head of a royal guard executed in Versailles in front of the queen, who was panicking.
The Filipino people themselves paid the war expenses of U.S. imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime for the purpose of settling most of the expenses and interest on bonds that fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government in Wall Street banks.
From now on, the super profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the main profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars it is necessary to understand the context that gave rise to the establishment of the order.
The European historical period in which these events take place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, between the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (i.e. between the years 1000 and 1300 A.D.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages which, by convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept that pragmatically comprises a wide range of ideas, from the technological impulse or imperative to a strict sense that there is an underlying logic that drives the fate of humanity and that relates to the laws of science and how they are embodied in technology.
Almost all interpretations of technological determinism have in common two general ideas: that technological development itself unfolds by a path independent of any cultural or political influence and that, at the same time, technology has “effects” on societies that are inherent and not socially conditioned.
To give an example, one might argue that the existence of automobiles necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a reduced volume of cars, with which new manufacturing techniques are being designed to reduce the costs of owning a vehicle.
The massive use of cars also generates a greater incidence of traffic accidents, leading to the development of new techniques in the field of health to repair damaged bodies.
The element of cultural determinism was very much present in Romanticism, according to scholars such as Goether, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people and, over time, developed customs and cultures related to that geography that, being in harmony with the location of that society, were preferable to laws that were imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion city today, Constantinople was considered as such in feudal Europe.
Its fame for being the epicenter of luxury began in about 400 B.C. and extended until about 1100 A.D.
During the 12th century its status declined, mainly because, on their return, the Crusaders brought gifts, such as silks and spices, which were given greater value than the goods offered in the Byzantine markets.
The title of “Fashion Capital” was then transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style took place in the period between the X-XI and the XIV centuries.
At first, the way of dress received great influence from Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of communication channels, Western styles could take a delay of about 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant advances of that time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to clasp their clothes.
Subsistence farming is defined as the production of sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family group.
Subsistence farming is a simple, generally organic practice that combines the use of stored seeds originating from the ecological region with crop rotation or other comparatively simple methods to maximize production.
Historically, much of the main activity of farmers was subsistence agriculture, which is still practiced in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas and feelings of marginalization by social standards and gives them the ability to generate a sense of identity.
There are many factors that can distinguish subcultures: age, ethnicity, class, location or gender from their members.
The traits that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, sexual, geographical or be related to religion or politics, or a mixture of factors.
It is common for members of a subculture to exhibit traits of their belonging to it by resorting to the distinctive and symbolic use of style, such as fashion, gestures and slang.
One of the most commonly used mechanisms to graph the importance of socializing is to analyze the few and regrettable cases of children who, out of negligence, misfortune or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults during their growth.
These children are called "wild". Some wild children are confined by people, usually their parents. In some cases, the abandonment of a child is due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have suffered traumatic situations or serious child abuse before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been bred by animals and some have lived on their own in the wild.
When the wild child is raised exclusively by animals other than humans, it presents behaviors (within its physical possibilities) almost identical to those of the specific animal that cared for it, as well as its fear or indifference to people.
Although project-based learning should facilitate that process and make it more interesting, scaffolding goes a little further.
Scaffolding is not a learning technique; rather, it is an assistance that provides support to those going through a new experience, such as the use of a new computer program or the start of a new project.
Scaffolding can be presented in both real and virtual format; to put it another way, a teacher is a kind of scaffolding, but so is the small animated clipboard of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is embedded in software and its function is to question, stimulate, or explain procedures that may have been complex to the student on their own.
Children are welcomed into foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from negligence to abuse and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment where there is no love, care, and education; but it happens.
We can perceive that the family reception system provides a safe environment for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving tutors, sustained education, and reliable medical care.
The purpose of the family reception is to cover all the needs that were not met in the home from which they were previously collected.
The Internet unites and mixes components of mass communication and between people.
The different features presented by the Internet open the way to new dimensions from the perspective of the concept of uses and rewards.
For example, “learning” and “socialization” are noted as significant incentives for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
During a study of user reactions to websites conducted by Eighmey and McCord (1998), “personal involvement” and “durable relationships” were also detected as new motivational factors.
Through the recording of videos, important findings have been made in the interpretation of micoreexpressions, which are facial movements of only a few milliseconds in length.
Specifically, it is argued that by properly reading their microexpressions, it is possible to detect if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President’s Speech, explained how those who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can, however, evaluate sincerity accurately.
It even suggests that the skills to interpret human behavior can be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
Through the research work of the twentieth century it has been shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
The mutation process incorporates a new genetic variation; the selection process removes it from that set of variations.
Segregation and recombination skew the variation between one and another generation after generation.
In the savanna, it is not easy for a primate, whose digestive system is equal to the human, to meet their amino acid needs with the plant resources at its disposal.
What’s more, not doing so leads to serious problems: stunting, malnutrition and, ultimately, death.
The proteins present in the leaves and legumes would have been the source of easier-to-access plant resources, but they are not easily digestible for primates like us, except that they are cooked.
Instead, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest while providing a large number of proteins that contain all the essential amino acids.
In short, it should not surprise us if our own predecessors solved their “protein problems” in the same way as savanna chimpanzees today.
Sleep disruption consists of intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and falling asleep after a while (10 to 60 minutes).
This can easily be achieved with a more or less gentle alarm clock that makes you return to a conscious state, though without waking you up completely.
Registration is an additional requirement for the visa process. In some countries, you will need to register your presence and the address of your accommodation with the local authorities.
Other options that are based on the biological rhythm consist of drinking a lot of fluid (especially water or tea, known as diuretic) before going to bed, which will force you to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace a person enjoys is related in opposite ways to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the force of life that we count on. Each of us has the potential to find peace and absolute bliss.
We can all reach enlightenment. The only thing that hinders the way is our tension and negativity.
While the foundations of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, they spread along the path of Mahayana love and numerous yoga techniques of India.
In general terms, laism is very simple. It is based on kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that encompasses everything.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (lighting) is activated with yoga positions, breathing practices, mantras or visualizations.
Tibetan meditation focuses on Devata Yoga. Through the visualization of different deities, energy channels can be unhindered, chakras activated and enlightenment awareness developed.
The cooperation between the USSR and the USA was the result of facing a common enemy, Germany, during World War II. After the war, the clashes of system, process and culture ended up distancing the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, those who were allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would extend for the next 40 years and would be truly fought, through proxy militias, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, among many other sites.
Because by September 17, 1939 the Polish defense was already broken, their only hope was to give up and reorganize in the extension of the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans fell into disuse almost overnight, when more than 800,000 Red Army fighters of the Soviet Union entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the pact of Multilateral Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression and other bilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods is a much more effective way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the navy has always been to ensure that its country retains the ability to move its population and goods, while interfering with the enemy’s ability to do the same.
The North Atlantic campaign in World War II offered one of the clearest and most recent examples of this: Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic in order to support Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mainly submersibles, tried to cancel this circulation.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany could have taken power in Britain, as it did with the other European countries.
Apparently, goats were domesticated for the first time, about 10,000 years ago, in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
In order to easily obtain their milk, hair, flesh and leather, ancient peoples and tribes began to stay with them.
Domestic goats were usually gathered in flocks that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds of goats that used to be children or teenagers, similar to the most popular shepherd. These methods of grazing are still used today.
In England, the railways had already been installed by the 16th century.
Even though the carriage rails were made of simple parallel wooden boards, they allowed the horses pulling from them to achieve a higher speed and drag heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
The incorporation of sleepers to keep the rails in place occurred quite early, but gradually they realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were coated with iron on top.
This became a common practice, although the iron caused further wear on the wheels of the wagons, made of wood.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with other ones made of iron and, in 1767, solid iron rails began to be used.
The first form of transport that was known was walking. The human being began to do so in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning man standing).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not have the habit of walking upright.
While bipedal footprints have been found in fossil Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can start living a more planet-friendly life, be part of environmental movements, or even become activists and fight to reduce, to some extent, future suffering.
It is, in many cases, like asymptomatic treatment, but if we are not looking for a temporary situation, we should find the root of the problems and try to turn them off.
It is evident that the world has undergone great changes, the product of the technological and scientific advances of humanity, and the problems have intensified because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of people.
After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was sent and signed by Congressional President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson to John Dunlap’s printing press, a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as the “Dunlap Copies”.
It was John Nixon who first read the document and did so in the Independence Hall courtyard on July 8.
On July 6, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his army in New York on July 9, and another copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 photographs of Dunlap, which are known to still exist, are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript has been lost.
A large number of paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today.
Many people don’t picture them as dinosaurs, as they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many features in birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scaly and clawed limbs, lay eggs and move on their hind legs just like the T-Rex.
Currently, almost all computers operate on the basis of the manipulation of encoded data under the binary system.
A binary number can only have one of two values, they are 0 and 1 and, according to computer jargon, these numbers are known as binary digits, or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately evident. Its symptoms, such as vomiting, are too common to be able to give an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest indicator of internal poisoning can be found with an open vial of toxic medicines or cleaning chemicals.
Read the label to have specific information about the relevant first aid for that specific poison.
Entomologists use the term insect parasite in a formal sense to refer to this group of arthropods.
The word comes from its ancient relationship with bedbugs, a species highly developed to parasitize humans.
Killer bed bugs and bed bugs are nidiculous; they are adapted to inhabit the nest or home of their host.
Registered cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the U.S. amount to about 400,000, making it the most common neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
The central nervous system, junction of the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve, is the target of attack of multiple sclerosis.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple might conclude that raising a baby would not be most convenient for them or the child.
These couples may choose to plan the adoption of a baby.
In an adoption, biological parents waive their parental rights so that a different partner can take care of the child.
The main objective of science is to decipher the way the world works through the scientific method. Indeed, this method serves as a guide for most scientific research.
It is not, however, an experiment, it is a test that is used to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses, making questions and observations that guide scientific research.
The focus of both naturalists and philosophers was placed on classical works; especially on the Latin version of the biblical text.
Aristotle’s thoughts, especially questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the dominance of the Greek language waned, the West distanced itself from its Greek roots both philosophically and scientifically.
Often, many rhythms present in physiological processes and in behavior depend decisively on internal cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just about reactions to regular external stimuli, have been recorded in almost all living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks oscillate in a self-sustaining manner and have a free cyclic period of operation, even if there are no external stimuli.
One of the key indicators that DNA consisted of a genetic-type material was the experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase inserted their own DNA into a bacterium using phages, or viruses.
They performed two experiments in which they labeled the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the DNA protein with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether it involves germ cells, the mutation can have various effects.
Only mutations in germ cells can be transmitted to children, while those that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism usually attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, which includes wildlife and plants.
Some examples of possible activities on site are: hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks, and ecosystem information study.
An example is visiting, taking photographs and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their jobs and often cross paths with others whose jobs are in the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transportation system based on the use of private cars, and they hold it.
Currently, scientists argue that this massive carbon economy has deprived the biosphere of one of its regular states that has contributed to the evolution of humanity for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and makes use of transportation systems; and almost everyone complains about them.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear similar levels of claims about water quality or bridge collapse.
What is the reason for transport systems to give rise to complaints of such caliber and why do failures occur on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incapable? Or is there something more substantial that is happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the individual movement of drivers and vehicles between two points and of the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is not an easy task to study the flow of traffic, as it is not possible to make accurate predictions about the behavior of drivers.
Fortunately, there is a tendency for drivers to maintain relatively consistent behavior, allowing traffic flows to be logically consistent and subject to approximate mathematical representation.
In order to more clearly graph the flow of circulation, relationships were established between the three most important elements: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) velocity.
Such relationships facilitate both the planning and design and operations of road devices.
The first species to fly were insects, which helped them to evade their enemies more easily and to find food and mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to bend their wings backwards, sticking them to the sides of the body.
This provides them with a wider range of possible small places to hide from predators.
Currently, anisopters and ephemeropters are the only insects unable to bend their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus commented that the Solar System revolved around the Sun.
There were those who shared his theory, but many others believed the opposite: that the solar system orbited the Earth, even the Sun and other stars.
This seems to make sense, since your movement is not perceived on Earth, right?
The Amazon River is the largest and second largest river on the planet, containing 8 times more water than the river that follows it in size.
In addition, the Amazon is the widest river on the planet, at some points with an amplitude of up to six miles.
Of the total water coming from the world’s rivers flowing into the oceans, 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The great Amazon River has an extension of 6387 km (3980 miles) and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, it was never able to surpass those of Giza, neither in size nor in the sublime technique of its construction.
The ancient Egyptian people of the New Empire were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were more than a millennium old.
With approximately 800 inhabitants, Vatican City is the smallest independent country in the world and the smallest in population.
Italian is used in Vatican City, both to draft its regulations and to issue its official communiqués.
The language spoken daily by most of those working within the state is also Italian and the use of Latin is generally reserved for religious ceremonies.
All of the citizens living in Vatican City ascribe to the Roman Catholic religion.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known since ancient times, since they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to extract with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle developed the theory that everything is made up of a combination of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more similar to the states of matter (in identical order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, only at the same time it had the theory that they are transformed into new substances that make up the things we see.
Alloys are basically a combination of two or more metals. Remember that the periodic table has many elements.
Metals are considered elements such as calcium and potassium. Since then, there are also metals of the gold and silver type.
There may also be alloys with small amounts of elements, such as carbon, that are not metallic.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter, made up of small particles called atoms.
The size of the atoms is so impressively tiny that the end point of this sentence could contain trillions of them.
Therefore, when it was invented, the pencil won many friends.
Unfortunately, as a result of the implementation of new writing methods, the pencil is used less and has lost its status.
Nowadays, people write messages on the screens of their computers. They do not have the need to even approach a pointer.
It only remains to wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new emerges.
The atomic bomb operates on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It is similar to what happens when a heavy cart rolls up a hill, and when it divides the core once more, it releases some of that energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable, that is, they tend to decompose with a minimum or almost no thrust.
The surface of the moon is composed of rocks and dust and its outer layer is called crust.
The bark has a thickness of about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
There may be more seas on the nearby side because its crust is thinner, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on looking for what attracts or likes people.
These doctrines hold that people have certain needs or desires that have been internalized as they grew to maturity.
These theories analyze what causes certain people to want the things they do and what factors in their environment force them to do certain things or not.
Two well-known theories are that of the hierarchy of needs, of Maslow, and that of the two factors, of Hertzberg.
In general, there are two types of behavior when managers begin to lead their former peers. On one side of the spectrum, there is the attempt to continue to be “one of the boys” (or girls).
Managers in this category have a hard time making decisions that hurt employees, imposing disciplinary measures, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibilities and demanding accountability to staff.
At the other end of the spectrum, it mutates into an unrecognizable person who believes it is necessary to modify everything the group has been doing so far and do it their way.
Ultimately, the ultimate responsible for the success and failure of the team is the leader.
This way of behaving often ends up distancing the leaders from the other team members.
The same standards of excellence that conventional computers handle apply to virtual machines, although there are small differences.
Often, members of a virtual team operate as a point of contact for their closest physical group.
They usually enjoy greater autonomy than members of a traditional group, thanks to the fact that it is possible for their teams to meet according to different time zones that, for example, may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a real “invisible team” (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also an exclusive element of virtual teams.
The “invisible team” is the group in charge of the management and to which each member is reported. It is the one that sets the standards for each member.
One of the purposes of applying the theoretical concepts of organizational learning is to promote innovation, which is the process of creating a learning organization.
When all available resources are properly used in the operational departments of an organization, space is created for creativity and ingenuity.
As a result, it is possible that the process of an organization working in a team to overcome a difficulty leads to a new innovative process in order to meet the needs of customers.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must first generate a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuous approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide factual evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, thus reducing the field of research and giving it greater accuracy.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior contributes to the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in mental functions.
Thanks to the apogee of new technologies, we have the opportunity to see and investigate structures and processes that occur in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with abundant information and material to develop simulation models, which favor our understanding of mental processes.
While artificial intelligence is very much associated with science fiction, it is a highly relevant specialty within computer science, which is responsible for behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in the field of AI involves the development of machines in order to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include monitoring, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer inquiries, as well as facial, writing and voice recognition.
These issues have become separate disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the sectors of economics, medicine, engineering, and militia, just as it was incorporated into various video game software applications and personal computers.
Study trips are an important part of any classroom. It is very common for a teacher to want to take her students to places that it is not possible to reach by bus.
The solution comes from the hand of technology, through virtual excursions. Students can observe the objects displayed in a museum, visit an aquarium or contemplate beautiful works of art sitting with their class.
Sharing an excursion in virtual form is also a great way to reflect on an outing and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital and every year the page is updated, but previous versions are kept online that in the form of a souvenir album.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Even though students often start their blog experience with low-key grammar and spelling, this usually changes in the presence of an audience.
Because students tend to be the most critical readers, the blog writer begins to strive to improve his writing, in order to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging “demands that students be more understanding of the world than they are around them.” The need to animate the interest of the audience inspires them to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a resource that inspires collaboration and encourages students to deepen their learning beyond the typical school day.
The proper use of blogs “can empower students to be more analytical and critical, through the active response to Internet content, can define their positions in the context of the writings of others, in addition to establishing their perspectives on specific topics” (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada’s captivating bilingual capital and boasts a variety of museums and art galleries that showcase the country’s history and current affairs.
Niagara Falls are further south and the north is home to Muskoka’s untapped natural beauty and the extension that follows.
All these aspects, among others, are those that highlight Ontario as intrinsically Canadian in the eyes of foreigners.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are wild, almost uninhabited lands.
To make a population comparison that causes great surprise to many: in the United States live more African Americans than Canadians.
The location of the East African islands is off the east coast of that continent, in the Indian Ocean.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in itself if we talk about wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands constitute independent or associated states with France and are popular for their beaches and luxury resorts.
Islam was also brought to the lands by the Arabs and was imposed, to a large extent, on the Comoros and Mayotte.
The initial tip of European influence and colonialism took place in the 15th century, following the discovery, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, of the route that connects the Cape of Europe with India.
The region borders the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: All female visitors are advised to state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It will also be useful to wear a ring (just make sure it doesn’t look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can provoke what they consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon for them to be followed, taken by the arm, etc.
Be blunt in rejecting men and don’t be afraid to defend their position (there are cultural differences or not, that’s not right!).
The founders of the modern city of Casablanca were the Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC and the Phoenicians, Romans and merenids used it as a strategic port, called Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese as the White House, but in 1755 it was abandoned after an earthquake.
The city was rebuilt by order of the Moroccan sultan under the name of Daru l-Badya and the Spanish merchants who established their businesses there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring places in all of Morocco to go shopping.
In the surroundings of the ancient Medina, there are plenty of places where traditional Moroccan items are sold, such as clay pots, ceramics, leather products, water pipes and a whole range of trifles, although everything is prepared for tourists.
Goma is a tourist attraction in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the eastern border, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma and left much of its streets submerged, especially in the city center.
While Goma is fairly safe, any overseas visit should be considered in order to take note of the situation of the ongoing clashes in North Kivu province.
In turn, the city is the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano and its mountain gorilla sighting excursions are among the most economical in Africa.
To move into Goma, you can choose to take a wedding-wedding (mototaxi). The regular rate (local) is CDF500 (Congolese francs) for a short trip.
This, in addition to being relatively inaccessible, has given “Tombuctu” an image of exotic and distant land.
Although today Timbuktu is an impoverished city, it still has an airport and its reputation makes it a tourist attraction.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites at Risk, a product of the desert sands threat.
It was one of the most important stops of the special Wonders of the African World, by Henry Louis Gates, on PBS.
The city contrasts greatly with the rest of the country, as it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (PNK) is located in northeastern South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which develops a different wildlife.
This is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is recognized as the main icon of the National Parks of South Africa (SANParks).
As in all South Africa’s nature reserves, there are daily fees for conservation and park access.
It may also be convenient to purchase a Wild Card that allows entry to selections of parks in South Africa or to all National Parks in the country.
The territory of Hong Kong takes the name of the homonymous island, which is the destination much of tourists consider the main attraction.
The deployment of buildings that delimit the Hong Kong skyline has been compared with a luminous bar chart that is evidenced by the presence of the waters of Port Victoria.
The way to enjoy the best views of Hong Kong is to leave the island and head to the Kowloon shore, located in front.
It is in the reclaimed lands of Hong Kong’s northern coast where its urban development is concentrated.
This is the site that the British conquerors adopted as their own. Therefore, if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of this region, it is a convenient place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest chain of coastal mangroves in the world, with a length of 80 km (50 miles) from the coast towards the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The section of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Without prejudice to this, forests are not only mangroves, but they possess some of the last remaining trees from the imposing jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans comprises an area of 3850 km2 and about a third of its extent is covered by water or swampy areas.
The Sundarbans have been a temple of wildlife since 1966 and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Tigers of Bengal and some 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the station between districts (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those traveling east and to Jakar (also called Bumthang), depart between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m.
Because inter-district buses are often crowded with passengers, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.
Almost all districts have the service Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi ride is an agile and convenient way to move to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a sprawling structure that crosses it, connecting Oiapoque, a Brazilian city, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 m, with a length of 378 m and two lanes 3.5 m wide.
Under the bridge there is a free space of 15 meters and, although its construction was completed in August 2011, it was not enabled for transit until March 2017.
The full operation of the bridge is estimated for September 2017, which is when Brazilian customs controls are expected to end.
The area that currently constitutes eastern Paraguay was inhabited by the Guaran<0xC3><0xAD>s, who were the most important indigenous group in the region and who lived as seminomadic hunters, in addition to practicing subsistence agriculture.
The Chaque<0xC3><0xB1>a region was home to other aboriginal groups, such as the Guaycur<0xC3><0xBA> and Payagu<0xC3><0xA1>, who hunted, collected and fished as a means of subsistence.
Paraguay, formerly known as “The Giant Province of India”, was born in the 16th century, as a product of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began the colonization phase, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunci<0xC3><0xB3>n was established in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its idiosyncrasy and Aboriginal identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best teams and the best polo players in the world.
The most important tournament of the year takes place in December in the Las Ca<0xC3><0xB1>itas polo fields.
Other lower tournaments and games can also be seen in other parts of the year.
On the site of the Argentine Polo Association you will get information about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches.
The value of the Falkland Islands pound (FKP), the official currency of the Falkland Islands, is fixed in equivalence with the British pound (GBP).
There's only one bank on the islands where you can change your money. It's in front of the FIC West store in Stanley.
Pounds are usually accepted anywhere within the islands. At Stanley, you can also pay with credit cards or U.S. dollars.
There are chances that credit cards will not be accepted on the islands on the periphery, but you could use British or American money. Ask the owners in advance to define what the accepted payment method is.
It is practically impossible to change money from the Falkland Islands outside the archipelago, so try to do so before leaving.
Because Montevideo is located in the south of Ecuador, it is summer there when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with frequent temperatures above +30°C during the summer.
Winter cold can be misleading: while it is very rare for temperatures to be below freezing, wind and humidity interact to make it perceived colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specifically “rainy” or “dry” seasons; the amount of rain remains almost the same throughout the year.
While many animals in the park are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild, so you don’t have to feed it or disturb it.
According to park authorities, at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from the rest of the wild animals should be maintained.
No matter how mellow they may look, the truth is that bison, uapathies, moose, bears, and virtually all large animals can become aggressive.
Dozens of visitors suffer injuries each year for not keeping a proper distance. These animals are large, wild and potentially wild; therefore, respect their space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so you should avoid having or cooking foods that release a lot of flavor and maintain cleanliness in the camp.
The capital of Samoa, the city of Apia is located on the island of Upolu and has just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the port was the scene of a disastrous naval confrontation when seven German, American and English ships refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruise ship was sunk, and nearly two hundred American and German individuals died.
During the war of independence that faced the Mau movement, a peaceful encounter in the city had as a balance the assassination of the head of state Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are a large number of beaches, because Auckland has two ports. The best known are located in three areas.
In the North Harbour district of the Pacific Ocean, there are North Shore beaches, which range from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are almost all sandy with safe places to swim and mostly have pohutukawa trees that offer shaded spots.
In the port of Waitemataas, the beaches of Tamaki Drive are deployed, in the extravagant neighborhoods of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in the central region of Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes very crowded, with numerous and varied shops available about the thing. They are also safe for swimming.
Number One is the most popular local beer and is not complex, but rather pleasant and refreshing. The other regional beer is the Manta.
While there is a wide variety of French wines, those from New Zealand and Australia could be considered better to transport.
Local tap water is completely safe for consumption, but if you’re worried, you’ll be able to easily find bottled water.
Australians consider the notion of “flat white” coffee to be foreign. A black coffee is called “espresso”, cappuccino is served with cream (instead of foam) and tea is not taken with milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but delicious.
Numerous trips to the reef are made throughout the year and, there, injuries from any of these causes are rare.
In any case, accept the advice of the authorities, respect all signals and pay special attention to security alerts.
Cubomedusas are located near the beaches and estuaries of the rivers from October to April, north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside this time.
Sharks do exist, but they almost never attack people. Most of them fear them and would swim away.
The ocean is not the place where saltwater crocodiles actively reside. Its primary habitat are the estuaries of the rivers that are located north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance of the trip gives you peace of mind that you will have a place to sleep when you arrive at your destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with specific hotels, although through them it is also possible to book another type of accommodation, such as camping areas.
Usually, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transfers to and from the airport, and even combined packages of flights and accommodation.
They can also save you the reservation in case you need time to better think about the offer, or to obtain other documents for your destination (such as the visa).
However, any modification or request must be made through the travel agent first, and not directly through the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of those attending music events decide to camp on site and most viewers consider it a crucial aspect of the experience.

Some establishments serve free spirits, although drunkenness affects judgment and every good player knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who intends to drive in high latitudes or in mountain passes should foresee the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On roads with ice or snow, there is little friction, so it is not possible to drive as it does on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms can fall such an amount of snow that it leaves you trapped in a very short time.
In addition, visibility can be reduced by snowfall or by condensation or ice that forms in the windows of the car.
On the other hand, in many countries ice and snow conditions are normal and traffic flows almost without any interruption throughout the year.

Various methods of purifying water are known, some more effectively attacking certain specific threats.
In some places it is enough to boil water for a minute, in others several more are needed.
Not all filters have the same effectiveness and, if you are concerned about this, you should consider buying bottled water with a seal from a certified company.
Travelers may encounter pests from animals that are not known in the regions where they come from.
Pests are capable of ruining food, causing irritation or, in more serious cases, causing allergic reactions, spreading poison or transmitting infections.

On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, the section between Point Marion and Fairmont is one of the most challenging driving conditions and often runs through secluded and lonely terrain.
If you don’t usually drive on rural roads, be on the alert: there are many steep slopes, narrow lanes and closed corners.
The set speed limits are notoriously lower than in previous and following sections, usually from 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h), and their strict compliance is even more important than in any other section.
Interestingly, however, cell phone signal is much better here than in many other sections of the road like Pennsylvania Wilds.
The German pastry is of good quality and, in Bavaria, the cakes are quite tasty and varied, similar to those prepared in Austria, its southern neighbor.
Fruit cakes are common, with apples cooked inside throughout the year and cherries and plums that appear in the summer.

The stirrups are the mounts for the riders' feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
While they provide greater stability to the rider, they may present safety issues as their feet may get stuck in them.
If a rider is dismissed from the horse, but has one foot stuck in the stirrup, he can be dragged if the animal runs away. To reduce the risk, there are a number of safety precautions.
First of all, most riders wear taco riding boots that have a ready and fairly narrow sole.
In addition, there are mounts, especially the English ones, with safety bars that allow the leather of the stirrup to detach from its structure if a rider who goes out fired pulls back.
The Cocham<0xC3><0xB3> Valley is Chile’s most popular climbing destination and is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of extensive walls and granite cliffs.

Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular disciplines that consist of skiing or a board fixed to the feet, on a snowy terrain.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many fans, sometimes called "ski lovers", who organize their holidays entirely based on skiing at a specific site.
The idea of skiing is very old, as there are cave paintings depicting skiers dating back to around 5,000 BC.
As a discipline, alpine skiing dates back to not after the 17th century. In 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski backpacker: also known as rural skiing, cross-country skiing or skiing hiking.
While linked, it generally does not involve cross-country skiing or alpine-style mountaineering, developed on steep slopes and with much stiffer skis and shoes.
Imagine the ski slope as a hiking trail.
In satisfactory conditions, you will manage to travel distances a little longer than if you do it on foot, but very rarely will you reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a good weight backpack on conditioned tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling across several countries would mean having to manage visa applications and passport checks several times.
However, the Schengen area functions as a single country in this regard.
Usually, as long as you move within this region you will be able to cross the borders without going through a passport checkpoint again.
In the same way, with a Schengen visa, you do not need to manage permits for each of the member countries of this space separately. This will save you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal criterion that determines when a manufactured good can be considered an antique. Some tax agencies have established that objects over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition varies geographically, where the age limit could be more narrowed in places like North America than in Europe.
It may happen that products made by hand are classified as antiques, even being newer than goods of similar characteristics manufactured in series.
Reindeer breeding is a fundamental way of life among the lapons and the culture related to this commercial activity is important for many dedicated to other professions.
Even so, even traditionally, not all lapoons have been engaged in large-scale reindeer breeding, but have lived from fishing, hunting and other similar activities, using reindeer primarily as traction animals.
Today, many Laplanders work in modern commercial activities. Tourism represents an important income in Lapland, the S<0xC3><0xA1>mi region.

Transgender people who have not yet undergone surgery should not expect to go through the scanners with their dignity and privacy intact.
Return currents are the backflow of waves that break on the shore, often in a reef or the like.
Because of the underwater topology, the return flow gathers in certain areas of greater depth and there can arise a rapid current in the direction of deep waters.

As soon as you manage to escape the current, swimming back will not be more complex than usual.

Finland is an excellent destination for sailing: the “land of a thousand lakes” also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don’t always need a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
While the coastal archipelagos and the most caudal lakes are wide enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak provide a different experience.
Navigar is a national recreational activity in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight inhabitants.
The same is true in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Most of the exclusive cruises that take place across the Baltic Sea include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.

The courier companies are paid very well for making quick deliveries.Often, the time is very important when it comes to commercial documents, merchandise or spare parts for urgent repairs.
Large companies have their own planes on some routes, but there was a problem for smaller companies and other routes.
If they made an air freight shipment, on some routes it may have taken days to unload and customs.
The only option to do so more quickly was to send it as checked baggage. The regulations of the airlines prohibit the carriage of luggage without a passenger, and this is where you come into play.
The obvious way to travel in the first class or in the executive class of an airplane is to spend a fortune for that privilege (or, better yet, make your company pay for you).
But this comes at a price: in general terms, you can pay up to four times the economic rate in business class and up to eleven in class.
It’s usually silly to look for discounts for first-class seats or business class on direct flights.
Airlines are well aware that there is a basic group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving at a site quickly and comfortably, and charging accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chi<0xC5><0x9F>in<0xC4><0x83>u. Its regional language is Romanian, although Russian is also widely spoken.

Do not ruin the place by making marks or make graffiti on the structures.
Catalan and Spanish are the official languages of Barcelona. Approximately half of its people prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it and practically everyone knows Spanish.

All the animals that originally came to the islands came to this place by swimming, flying or floating.
Because they are far away from the mainland, mammals could not get there, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing creature in the Galapagos.
