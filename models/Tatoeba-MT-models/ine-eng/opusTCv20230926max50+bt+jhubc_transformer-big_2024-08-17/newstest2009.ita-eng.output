The Prague Stock Exchange at the close of the market had a negative collapse.
After the morning crash, the Prague Stock Exchange resumed losses.
The transactions of CEZ shares have reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since the beginning of Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has resumed from the collapse of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this decline is the collapse of stocks on Wall Street.
Thus, also from us, there is a market reaction to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the stabilization plan of the local financial sector.
Collapse of Stocks in Asia
On Tuesday, shares of the Asian Stock Exchange suffered a dramatic collapse, although the indexes, however, during the day later cleared a portion of the losses.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange during the day cleared almost 4%, but later also a part of the losses stabilizing at 2.5%.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks the movement of Chinese shares on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8% while markets in Shanghai were closed.
Shares on the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but eventually the losses settled at 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
“The planning of the bailout is uncertain and this will affect financial markets around the world,” said Hong Kong’s chief currency officer Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages financial policy on its own, so it does not depend on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
U.S. lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will also suffer the consequences.
Massacre of American Actions
The US Parliament on Monday rejected the financial system’s support plan, for which $700 billion (almost 12 billion Czech crowns) was to be allocated.
Lawmakers have thus ignored President Bush’s call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks suffered a massacre on Monday, and the main stock indexes recorded the biggest crash in more than a decade.
The Dow Jones index dropped by nearly 7% and a similar-sized drop was last seen in 1987.
The index was already falling before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it went into free fall.
Congress has given up: the U.S. government can give $700 billion to banks.
The top representatives of the U.S. Congress and the government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of economic support for the U.S. financial system.
The vote on this will be at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers broke the ice in the dialogue on approving the bailout plan in the form of economic aid to the U.S. financial system for a total of $700 million (almost 12 trillion crowns).
But it is not yet said.
Representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The plan to support the financial system will be discussed on Monday in the territory of the House of Representatives.
On Sunday, Barney Frank, chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, told Reuters.
In the Senate, according to some sources, you could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to the economists, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor capable of awakening the financial markets.
Then, however, there will be a return to reality because of the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, to reach the help of the markets.
Paulson: The Plan Must Be Effective
“We have taken a big step forward.”
"We have clarified our differing views on the form of the presentation of the market stabilisation package," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
The final vote is expected to take place on Sunday.
Lawmakers’ delegates met Saturday and Sunday night with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to give final form to the government’s financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which lead financial firms to serious losses and put the stability of the entire system at risk.
“We are in the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective on the market.”
“It’s necessary to carry out the recovery plan further, but I think we’re there,” Paulson said.
The Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis falls sharply on the stock markets that are collapsing sharply.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are thus trying to reach a final deal in Congress even before Sunday.
That is, they want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are, in order of time, the first to influence the market on Monday following the decision of Congress.
But for now it is not definitively clear when the two houses of the US Congress will pass the law and even if the negotiations can stop at the last minute on some issue.
The lawmakers hope it will be approved in the coming days.
But the law will still undergo many changes.
The total amount of support for the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion should be available as soon as possible as President George Bush has asked.
But Congress can block the rest of the money in the event it gets the impression that the program is not performing its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the 350 finals.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Even if the President can veto this decision, Congress can override his veto.
Despite these changes, the basic thinking of the program has remained, that is, to get the finances to buy passive mortgage securities, the price of which has collapsed due to hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
“We processed everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law on Sunday and the Senate on Monday," the Republican senator said.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the negotiations.
His spokesman Tony Fratto said Bush was pleased with Saturday’s positive move and appreciated “both parties’ efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Restriction of gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the top spokesman, said lawmakers agreed on the responsibility of the financial program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing the budget cuts, splitting the financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called gold parachutes for executives of companies participating in the program and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard and we’ve taken a big step forward toward the deal that will work and be useful for the market and also for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan relies on helping homeowners who have payment problems.
The government should negotiate the new mortgage installments it will buy with the goal of lowering monthly installment expenses for debtors and allowing it to keep their homes.
Marek: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to Patria Finance’s chief economist, David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
"And that's because we don't know how and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for how the losses will be divided between the financial sector and the government," Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
“Much more important, it is that already this week the representatives of the Congress find an agreement on the support of this plan and that they baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is more important at this time,” Marek said.
Battle to the last blood: MP3 players against mobile phones
We will advise how to choose
While almost every mobile phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
This makes it clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Nevertheless, there are many reasons why you should get an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you would hardly buy an expensive high-quality turntable to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album.
First of all, these musical products do not come out as LP and from a qualitative point of view for this reason there is not even an objective reason.
But if your shelves are full of hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyl, you probably dream of a turntable like this.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
Here, too, there are price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend for a reader 8 thousand crowns, just as a fan of Pink Floyd perhaps hardly digests the headphones from twenty crowns of the market.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It is up to you to decide the battery life.
Some high-quality music players manage to do much more than just read music, which, however, does not make mobile phones even by mistake.
There is no other current device as universal as the mobile phone.
Next to the primary functions, call and send sms, can read music and videos, record both and has a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe even can navigate.
And if we take into account smartphones and palms you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It is a small miracle because no refrigerator can do the grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile phone also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile phone and the earlier the indicator on the screen will require the charger.
Reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few cell phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As for cheap mobile phones, don’t count on them to last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, get yourself to work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive appliances.
But you won’t have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst ones last at least 9 hours at continuous functionality with a charge.
There is another problem when downloading music to your mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB port and not all of them can be connected to the computer without special software.
Certainly the music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory players are able to do it without an adapter for minicards that are not used in mobile phones.
Readers, except for some exceptions (Ipods) do not need any special software.
Simply fill the device with music via USB from your computer.
Most mobile phones and readers create themselves a multimedia library ordered according to the names of the performers, the name of the album, genre or according to the user's classification.
Some devices only play the folder tree structure, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some know how to do both things (river, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, pay particular attention to the battery resistance, memory capacity, quality and type of audio outputs and clearly the ease of use.
If you need music mainly from the background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram you just need a mobile phone that reads MP3.
This is now possible, clearly on any mobile phone.
You don’t have to worry too much about what formats your phone or reader recognizes.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be just in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most common ones, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
There is less AAC (format used by Apple and its iPods).
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Just visit, through the mobile internet, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid topic to buy a mobile-reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is poor and is usually limited only to the hit of the radio moment.
The prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this mode of selling music (either via GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their phones behind them.
Anyone who wants to listen to something frowns in their pocket while the MP3 player is forgotten at home.
But it also depends on this, if you always carry behind the headphones or at least the wireless headset.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every mobile phone, but only a small portion of MP3 players, has.
Perhaps the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3,000 crowns.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very dignified walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for the common headphones.
The best and technically most equipped mobile phones and also with the 3.5 mm socket for common headphones, cost up to 15 thousand crowns.
Instead, the advantage of readers is, in addition to others, easy handling.
The simplest ones are not necessarily cheaper (see our choice) anyone can really handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of the handling once with the common stereo or perhaps the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally impacting the launch of the mobile internet network and as a result of a giant bill for the transmission of data.
What equipment to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Also with regard to the purchase of the respective card, which is included in the 2,000 crowns.
But be careful.
The base models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones do it even with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1 100 crowns.
If you are among the most demanding listeners, preferably take specialized phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of the service so it comes close to the same MP3 player.
In this area, Sony Ericsson has made more strides, which phones of the walkman line have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands provide you with the same service and the same price category up to 4,000 crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (commonly 15 hours, usually up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic as early as this year.
Maybe.
Perhaps the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our operators offer virtually all services like their partners in Western Europe.
However, something is missing here – a virtual operator that obliges traditional operators to lower the price.
Maybe it won't be long.
The fact that Czech operators belong to the most expensive ones in Europe we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
At the end of the day, <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> also confirmed this, noting that the price of SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the European Commission’s latest steps in the field of regularisation of roaming charges, perhaps a paradoxical situation will arise – for some Czech mobile phone customers, SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that would really want to start the fight.
Maybe it sounds absurd, but here we have three mobile networks and coverage high above 100%.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense he often emphasizes also the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (<0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>), Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, who in the past has sometimes expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is perhaps true that the traditional operator with its own network probably no longer has many possibilities. (Otherwise it may be difficult to find other frequencies by now.)
But there is still another possibility - the virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry into the market of virtual operators that has led to a significant drop in prices, to which traditional operators would then have to react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile into the market, similar voices sounded in Britain as we do.
However, it has been shown that there is a place for such operators and that they can be really successful.
At the end of the day, we don’t have to go very far for examples.
In February of this year we informed you about the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year this operator managed to win more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, Mobilking is behind the Penta financial group to which the Czech Republic belongs, among other things, U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more concrete target group.
In order to be able to work effectively, it is enough to have far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not entail, that is to say, relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually come at low cost, offer cheap calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the narrowest range of services.
So for example Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS that cost at least half compared to its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows can be a pretty good move even betting on a target group not too long ago.
This operator aims, so to speak, specifically at men.
“Real men choose Mobilking operator they like and can be trusted,” says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether we can also assert a similar concept as in Poland.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: "The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of services, it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no possibility, mobile network operators say
But it seems almost certain that if there will ever be an operator in the Czech Republic it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not have many expectations.
Mobilking will be lit rather in other countries in our area," Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, the press spokesman for the financial group Penta, told Mobile.cz.
Thus, it indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very supportive of this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything because you do not create any potential competitor.
For some time now he has not hidden his interest in starting a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group that would like to take another step to become a real competitor of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We have a great interest in being able to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunications.
And the sooner you do better, the better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile network operators.
We have already made progress in the negotiations with some of them," said group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
So maybe better times will come.
Unofficial information shows that the first virtual operator will probably have it by the end of the year.
For now, however, an impenetrable wall of silence stands around its creation.
"At the moment we do not believe that there is room in the Czech market for the creation of a full-fledged virtual operator.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88> of the press section of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nika O2 mentioned in his statement to Mobil.cz.
The specificity of the Czech market is also used by other operators.
T-Mobil spokesman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> added in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "For now we have not noticed any commercial project that is vital and beneficial for both, on which it is possible to continue to build."
“On the T-Mobile network, a virtual operator will hardly appear before the end of the year.
At this point we have already had to have a concrete agreement on the table, so that it could be considered on the horizon.”
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on achieving its own 3G license requests.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to the negotiations of potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost-sharing and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the point of view of customers, the most producer.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common fast mobile internet network.”
The competent authorities -with the complicit operators
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to a decrease in profit.
Why, then, facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The annoyances around U:fon creation testify that when operators care about something they know how to row on the same side.
Perhaps the great pressure pressed <0xC4><0x8C>TU in the period of creation of U:fon towards the company of T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by the information of public access from the web pages of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>.
But right now U:fon serves as a topic for which not to accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> noted: “The competitive environment of the mobile phone market has been little more than enhanced with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would place high demands on him and above all on his services.
However, the attitude of mobile operators is quite surprising the complete disinterest on the part of the Czech regulatory bodies.
It is not just the attitude of the <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> that unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Economic Competition (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
This, however, has taken its typical position in relation to the whole problem.
“The virtual operator’s entry into the mobile phone market would be possible after the conclusion of the necessary infrastructure lease contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator has been completed.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers has probably not been interesting enough for traditional operators," said Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa, of the <0xC3><0x9A>OHS external relations section, in response to our question.
Such a statement by the representatives of the operators may come as no surprise.
On the other hand, it is more than a delicate matter on the part of the office that has to defend the interests of consumers and also to take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market.
Especially when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: “Outside where virtual operators commonly operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile telephony services.”
But obviously the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices do not belong to the interests of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
Truly shocking in the whole situation is the almost emotional harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it is really just a coincidence, it arises on its own.
Just as the same price of petrol for all petrol stations is certainly the result of coincidence and competition.
"The section found no signs of anti-competitive behavior regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, so it does not have a corresponding greater responsibility for its behaviour in the market.
The necessary tools for the opening of the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing from the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many controversial points.
Of course, there is the analysis of the relevant markets elaborated by <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>, according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of economic competition the only market.
In such a market, of course, no Czech operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always necessary the agreement of the operator of the network.
And the mobile operator has – logically, at the end of the day – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion it must be dominant by force.
But even if we do not admit this argument, for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS it should be a minimum warning that three mobile operators proceed in such a strange way.
At the same time, the complaints from stakeholders (including the aforementioned GTS Novera company) show that during negotiations with all operators they encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading responsibility to <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A> in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which <0xC3><0x9A>OHS keeps itself out of the whole thing.
We have already seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of <0xC4><0x8C>T<0xC3><0x9A>’s rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently approved update of the telecommunications law, despite the fact that many experts expected the situation to improve.
The representatives of <0xC3><0x9A>OHS need to know this more than well, but perhaps their interests lie elsewhere.
You can do it when no one is watching.
While without realizing it remains the operation of such pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are even some in the Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their price lists of mobile services, but they are only partially public.
These are usually companies that deal with multi-level marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only pre-established people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company appears to the operator as a classic corporate customer, who orders a large amount of SIM cards.
As an important customer you then receive special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the trading conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a pre-sale.
"If you present the cases you are talking about, which we will be interested in, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions, and could lead to the conclusion of cooperation with this company," said Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1>.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would reach the ears of the subjects responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the cases of the 3 mentioned companies, there may be thousands of customers.
No operator defends itself at the same time from such an attitude.
From the activity of these companies they derive a not indifferent profit and at the same time - unlike real virtual operators - they are not damaged in any way with their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns of possible problems: "The law allows for similar speculations, however, only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they cannot fully dispose of it as the usual customers of mobile phone operators."
But this is exactly what should be a little strange to <0xC4><0x8C>TU.
In addition, another question opens for <0xC3><0x9A>OHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that <0xC3><0x9A>OHS has rights strong enough to expose similar activities and if it does not want you will not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators who have no idea of all this and that their commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be more expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a significant drop in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all the countries where operators were born, traditional operators more or less tried to prevent their creation.
The topics they used were pretty much the same – too small a market, too saturated a limit, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But in the developed countries in these cases, the regulatory bodies have intervened to defend not the mobile operators but their customers.
Both with the formal measures and with the non-formal pressure, then we came to the creation of the first virtual operator and he was joined by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies throw themselves from one to the other the whole case like a boiling potato.
In our experience, we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But let's not throw away the sponge.
If the background information is correct and the virtual operator will appear really soon from us, the Czech mobile market will get back on its feet.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator, only <0xC3><0x9A>OHS could hardly remain impassive to the rejection (discrimination) of the other interested parties.
And perhaps we will stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best one
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek on the occasion of the Day of Recognition of the Czech Republic presented in a solemn way the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, chorus step and instrumental edition.
The song is directed by Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the hymn revisions are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the iHNed.cz website you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
Earlier he told the radio "<0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> rozhlas" that he specifically chose to sing the variants alone, the singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning, I have tried to make sure that both and the choir, too, have the clear diction that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate the 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov m<0xC5><0xAF>j" was first played in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh divadlo in the original work Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl accompanied by the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroupa.
It has gained popularity and people have spontaneously made it their own.
The first verse of the song after the foundation of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How does the "new" anthem sound
The Wednesday MHD in Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date on which in the metro, tram and bus will rise the first passengers who instead of the paper ticket will have in their pocket an electronic card.
At the moment, it can be purchased by about one hundred thousand people who own their own Opencard.
Passengers can buy the 30- and 90-day and annual (which will last from January 1, 2009) and at the same time have their card recharged at Infopoint and at the offices of the Transport Company and at the metro stop Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>any, Kobyla<0xC5><0xA1>k<0xC3><0xA1>rov, Raky.
The coupons can be bought from yesterday on the Internet at the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred customers took advantage of the service before the afternoon.
Those who will start using the service via the internet can completely forget about the lockers in the metro stops where they had to make long queues for paper tickets so far.
The cutting is purchased via the Internet and on the Opencard it is recharged at one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have at their disposal a desk with staff trained to help those interested in buying on the internet and also register on their card the credit acquired," said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
In addition to the libraries it will be possible to load the electronic cutters on the Opencards in ATMs and self-service that are installed at the entrances of the metro.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, similar to ticket obliterators and passengers have already noticed them at the metro stops Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"Now there are five in the whole city but by the end of the year there should be eighty," concluded Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
The cutting will be controlled instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and after payment of the cutting, it will load on top.
Electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added in Prague's integrated transports there are the controllers equipped with card readers with which they verify the temporal and zonal validity," explained the Filip ticket control mode from the Ropid organization, which sets the timetables for public transport in Prague.
Urban buses have card readers integrated into the driver’s box.
During the ascent it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but also to support the Opencard at a certain point next to the case.
Thus, the driver verifies the validity of the loaded cutting edges.
“If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loaded slips, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information,” Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who take the city buses and will not remember, when the validity of the cutting expires, can again go to the self-service ATM, where they load the cutters on the card.
Here you will see information about the validity of their documents on the screen of the device.
The Germans of the Sudetenland wanted a referendum from the USA
The Sudeten Germans in 1945 asked to include <0xC5><0xA0>umava to the United States.
This is due to the letter deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, according to what is said, some groups of Sudeten Germans turned in 1945 to the President of the United States.
This is in addition to the letter kept in a private archive and today deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in the letter to the American president not to allow again the return of the "district of <0xC5><0xA0>umava" - occupied by Hitler under the Munich agreement - to Czechoslovakia.
“We understand the situation and want to be sure of the promises that American units arrive on German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators,” the letter reads, “The people who hold the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava with all their hearts.”
Because, they say, the annexation of Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Sudeten Germans hope only for brutality, lack of respect, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate on <0xC5><0xA0>.
"We cannot believe that without regard to the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has contributed nothing, absolutely nothing, to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of revenge by the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States were to doubt the conviction of the Germans of <0xC5><0xA0>umava, it would be enough to organize in the district a referendum on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or live under the dominion of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem na<0xC3><0xAF>ve with our knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had to at least guess that it would be their move from the republic, only a few of them fully admitted such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudetenland peoples.
Others believed that they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is also confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German from Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice in the Baltic Sea sea power.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and put in the prison camp at Hol<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC3><0xBD>n, dozens of other Czech Germans went to find him so that he could teach him Czech.
"They believed that once they got home the Czech would make him comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners living in war-torn Czechoslovakia, according to him, counted on the fact that on the basis of the decrees of Bene<0xC5><0xA1> they would be moved from the Republic.
Don't think - you'll pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
Even so, you could define the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport intends to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous driving behaviour.
The campaign of 150 million will appear on television, radio, cinema, internet but also on leaflets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And also remind him to put on his belt before leaving.
It wants to touch in the conscience especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and last but not least professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially the stories of the people who will affect the emotions.
And this is also evidenced by the "bloody" slogan of the entire campaign:
Don't think - you'll pay!
The word "don't think" is capitalized on the plate.
And in a pool of blood there's the word "you'll pay."
This must symbolize that a person can in a moment of distraction pay with his life.
The ads will "scary" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where images with drastic scenes of victims of accidents can commonly be seen.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The ads were prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrot and stick to drivers
“The carrot and stick system works with drivers.
Carrots for them are for example when they go with red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risk," says transport ministry psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n of Na Homolce hospital.
And so we need information campaigns in the press and especially negative advertising, believes the psychologist.
According to him, the panels that warn drivers of danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed warning panel has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and drivers will no longer pay attention to it," warns Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n.
Olmert would return almost all the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
Israeli interim Prime Minister Ehud Olmert expressed his support for the return of virtually all the territories occupied in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
So he said in the dialogue he published Monday, the daily Jediot Acronot.
“We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all (occupied) areas, if not all, will need to be returned,” Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories but we will have to leave the Palestinians the same percentage (of the Israeli zones), because without this there will be no peace," he added.
He admitted that the eventual return will also include East Jerusalem.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and above all does not want the caterpillars or the plainsmen to pass on to him, as has happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a part of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in reference to the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens of people were injured.
According to the prime minister it will be necessary to find "a particular solution to the Temple Mount, the sacred and historical places," which are inside the Old City.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he added.
The retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was an essential condition for concluding this peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from Golan," he warned.
“The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They will have to renounce the current relationship with Iran; they will have to renounce their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they will have to renounce the permanent support, which they offer to the terrorism of Hamas, (the Shiite movement) of Al-Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war in Iraq).
Questions after the accident: Are stewards on buses illegal?
The law does not recognize them, you can not walk on the bus that makes long distances
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padua of the bus company Student Agency came out the question whether the stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the race.
“If we want to comply with the laws strictly and formally, the steward’s activity is in conflict with the law of road traffic,” said Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident last week that killed a 22-year-old hostess was caused by a truck that cut off the road to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the less safe place of the bus, despite there were still two more seats allocated.
But the bus can make an accident or brake abruptly even when distributing coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether the bus is equipped or not with standing places according to the circulation booklet.
If it is not approved, the passengers must be seated.
The buses of Student Agency have no standing places, the director of the company Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura confirmed on the website Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x95>.cz.
“We assessed this with the Ministry and at the beginning it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the race if they have the seat assigned," he said.
The law does not recognize the steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the steward’s role – no law deals with the regularization of this role.”
No regulation, however, prohibits the carrier from carrying out the services.
The law of road traffic only recognizes the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> believes that the law quite cures this problem.
It depends on whether the bus has the approved standing seats.
It's all there," he says.
Categorizes buses in urban areas where there are standing places and maximum limited speed, intercity buses with standing places with higher maximum speed and long-distance without standing places with the maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with seat belts.
Like on a plane, says the expert.
The BESIP expert on road safety Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n does not find the underlying problem in the movement of the stewards on board the bus.
"During a quiet race there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to the service on the aircraft.
It’s not safe there either when a turbulence comes and the flight attendant can shake his head.”
“If the bus makes a sudden brake, of course the laws of physics apply.
Just like in the city bus or on the tram.
The carrier has to solve the security of the stewards with an internal regulation," he says and also understands that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not solved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is willing to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of flight attendants.
It takes about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director considers their job dangerous.
“As soon as I get the feeling that I have to consider the steward’s profession as dangerous work, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they go up.
It would also reduce costs," he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of the lines compared to Student Agency, has motivated the absence of stewards on his means as an interest in security.
"We don't have a hostess, we are opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in a fatal accident," said F<0xC3><0xA1> T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz.
There has been an immense tragedy.
In the accident of the line to Naples died a young hostess from the region of Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably got out of the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the way to the bus.
The bus driver tried to avoid him with a sudden maneuver, but hit him with the front right.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura rejects the fact that the two seats reserved for the Stewarts' rest had been occupied.
"You can't reserve these seats on long-distance buses, they're unstoppable."
The company intends to report the driver of the truck.
The agency will not wait for the court’s ruling to pay damages to the girl’s family, but expects financial compensation from the culprit.
The revision of the law?
Not in sight
The review of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to clarifying the movement of Stewarts on buses.
“They have not achieved any concrete results.
They don’t consider them as much as coaches, they are more concerned with the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and use of the mobile phone while driving,” says expert Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of Stewarts as a major threat to the safety of passengers," said spokesman Havelka, who said that the control of the safety of buses is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf’s hopes focus on Frankfurt
There is no shortage of words in the letter from the director of WestLB addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that could form "the capital market center of the financial group of savings banks" through the meeting of units of the banking institution of D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
West LB would launch “a competent block” with lasting profits in such a venture.
Moreover, such a union could be a decisive boost for further links in the banking sector in the L<0xC3><0xA4>nder.
Thus it is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because the afflicted WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only on the part of the EU Commission, but also through the National Authority for Financial Supervision, having pointed out long ago to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is running out in search of a future solution.
The links between the Deka-Bank, which the same customers of the Savings Banks because of their investment funds already know, and the WestLB has certainly been talking about it for quite some time, even from Frankfurt.
At the end of August, the head of the Deka-Bank Franz Waas at the presentation of the turnover of the first half of the year that a merger of the house at Via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
However, the board of directors of the Deka, which is brought in half by regional banks and savings bank consortia, has delegated the board of directors to conduct talks with West LB on joint negotiations.
These could be market negotiations or parts of them.
The talks, however, have, as they say in the business square, just begun.
The Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the most important in the business square in Frankfurt, it is not the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings bank sector.
In 2003 for a short period it seemed that the Deka-Bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank and the Helaba.
Of this association of three, nothing was done about it.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank of Assyria opposed Helaba's participation.
The remaining two institutions have also proved unable to reach an agreement.
The Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank instead went to the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg regional bank in Stuttgart.
Yet they have often thought of us for a merger of the Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But in the end G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Merl, chairman of the board of directors of Helaba, spoke out against design games to reunite with his house.
Put aside this, it seems that knowledge is created, that it is necessary that the different houses of the public sector approach.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with that of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg could first take place.
This is not good news for Helaba at all.
If the pressure for other mergers increases, the partners will be missing.
In the South there would now be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than the houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The Assia-Turingia Savings Bank Association, which participates with 85 percent of the Helaba, has put the chain to the meeting with the WestLB.
Only the North LB would remain.
These geo-strategic considerations are just an account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of individual houses combine.
In June, Merl pointed out that the decisive question, with which business model the future of regional banks would be ensured, would not yet be answered by the German savings bank association.
In the end, the division of the West LB could also come out, which on the part of that of course is not desired.
Thus the letter of the board of directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a "general solution".
We will see how the reunification of the individual parts with the Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena it is the first time while for Luca it is the third or the fourth.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says that everything is different.
Behind them, next to the Kaiser brand’s 5L barrel, stands a massive beard and shows to about 200 travelers what deep tones it can produce from the throat.
Elena first gives Luca a hug and then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the bus parking next to Porta Nuova station, this evening at 23.45 four couriers with destination Monaco, Festa della Birra" , arrival scheduled at 6.30 am.
Three couriers are reserved mainly for Italians, in another travel only Brazilians.
In a corner of the parking lot the South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated during the night.
It is so noisy, says Marco, that it is not something for Italians.
Frame that wears a long coat with a fake fur lining and a pair of glasses with the wide silver studs belong to the buses.
For 5 years they go to the Oktoberfest, this year they are 3 tours.
The departure at night, by day to the party, back at 22.30.
Overnight would only create unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome of the toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to the Bavarian rules of genuineness, the disease box and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses leave in the turn of Brenner.
There's no beer yet.
Suddenly the silence falls on the bus, the travelers sleep.
Better that way, they'll still need their strength.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian license plates on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When Marco’s group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6.30 am, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
First, put on the yellow hat.
On it on the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conocersiviaggiando.it".
Second: “When they open the doors of the beer tent it means running!”, quotes Marco in the early morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, or we block, and not all the yellow hats sitting on the same benches, divide in the adjacent space!"
The bottle costs 8.25 Euro, screams Marco.
And don't forget to tip.
"Prove to the security service that we are doing well!
As soon as you leave the seats, they disappear!”
Third: "Tonight at 10.30 p.m. we will meet again here! Do you understand?"
He's already leaving for the party.
On the street one attacks as you follow the yellow hats to the trees, to the road signs and even to an advertising billboard of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as the "Italian Weekend".
Exact data does not exist, we are talking about 50 thousand, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is claimed that 10% of the visitors come specifically from Italy.
The police of Munich are reinforced with 7 agents from South Tyrol, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistic on nationalities, where Italians are in first place with 200 medical care in front of the British (about 60 medical care) and Austrians (about 80).
Especially loved by Italians is the tendon of the Hofbr<0xC3><0xA4>uhaus.
1. Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
The crisis began over the weekend.
The real estate financier Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, gets from a consortium of German banks a billionaire credit, in order to be able to protect themselves from turbulence in the markets.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday that support credits would reach up to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35 billion.
The Hypo Real Estate only has to pay the interest for the requested part.
The money comes from both private and public banks.
At the bottom are the losses of the affiliate Depfa.
The state funder, according to a newspaper article, refinanced in the very short term – which is no longer possible due to market mistrust.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserves had fallen by 95% to 2.37 million euros, and the share of equity capital also fell from 1.6 to 1.45.
Current income and net income from financial transactions had fallen to 0 compared to last year, earnings from increases in both applications and certain shares as well as the liquidation of credit provisions fell more than 70% on the 5 million Euro.
Only thanks to higher income from the return of subordinated compensation costs that come both from the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the repayment of interest according to the single text of the tax laws and from the management of business for business consortia, the negative profit was quite moderate with about 16%.
The former public lender after being privatized in 1990 had lost itself in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were disbanded in Aareal Bank.
Since the income in the classic state financing was too low, Depfa has engaged more in infrastructure projects and in financing joint projects of private and state investors (PPPs) and has diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate must now amortize the value of the affiliate, which will have a fundamental material effect on the profit and loss account of the group.
The fact is that the dividends have been cancelled.
In 2007, it was reduced by two-thirds.
The Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of Depfa is an important funder of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on refinancing on the market between banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have customer fiduciary deposits.
Due to the collapse of the American investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago the granting of loans between the banks largely dried up, because the banks accumulate liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate annually requires short-term refinancing for a part of Depfa’s credit portfolio – about 50 billion.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financial needs have been covered by credit for some time and the company is protected from the influence of mostly non-functioning international money markets.
From other sources it is heard, that thanks to the money the refinancing is secured until the end of 2009.
HRE chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the HRE group will not need money markets in the short term.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) are based on the fact that the marketability of the HRE Group is still ensured.
This is expected for the bank’s shareholders and creditors.
In view of the dynamics and weightlessness of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
Funding may not be fully utilized.
But the opposite is also not to be ruled out.
After Sunday night the bank learned it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the spirits.
The share price drops by 75% to 3.30 Euros.
They hold the mortgage courses pretty well.
While prior-degree debts are shown to be almost immovable, deferred credit courses yield.
The loans of the W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-Hypo affiliate are mainly affected, including the maturities with a maturity beyond 2009.
Before the loans of the HRE seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and the institution itself, which with the relief of the Depfa has occurred the crisis, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the central banks, governments and the least-damaged banks are still ready, you can count on an amortization of the annuities by the deadline.
Or it comes into operation, which no one dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But in the case of information overturned due to partial statisations, the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will especially create long-term investors some sleepless nights with the decision whether to split up from their commitments.
Short-term investors can conclude the reporting of losses for future payments of the countervailing tax on capital gains.
Sylvana and the Secrets of Bento-Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is due to attend Tachibana High School on her first day of school, the girls start to giggle: German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-the new exchange Log tells about Japan.
First Day of School in Japan
I was so excited.
I also had the nerve to go to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo towards Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the road by myself and fortunately I didn’t miss it.
The beginning of the first lesson does not seem to have been fixed as we did in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive slowly from 8 a.m. until at 8.40 a.m. a short interview with the teacher, the so-called "home room".
But before the lesson started, it was time for me to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of guy who likes to talk in front of people, plus in front of a class of 40 schoolchildren.
Since I didn't have the school uniform yet, I put on an old host mother's skirt, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Dressed this way I sat down in front of the chair and tried to pronounce well: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..."- my name is Sylvana, I come from Germany and I celebrate my birthday in a week.
At that time I was very happy that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class whispered, shrugged and made a sign and I heard the word “Kawaii” all the time.
I knew this from my manga.
It belongs to the essential lexicon of Japanese girls to survive and means "cute, sweet".
Then I ran quickly to my place.
The girl next to me sneezed, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the lesson was quietly continued, but when she played the gong, I was assaulted in the true sense of the word.
Everything was messy and sneezing and drying me with questions – then it’s really hard to understand the English of the Japanese.
During the break, everyone opened their blessing.
My host mother also made me the lunch basket- it's different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and a kind of rolls with meat and tofu..
In fact, I don’t even know what exactly I eat in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a completely new flavor.
The fact is, everything is really good.
Maybe except the plums put under salt, brrr!
The Bentos are not just lunch in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gives a Bento made by herself, prepared quite artistically, with the hope of then getting to know the boy during the recreation.
I read it in my Manga comics.
I'm really curious if I can find out.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I've always said:
"Because it fascinates me"
I have been reading Mangas for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I started to learn a little bit of the Japanese language.
I was totally convinced I'd come here once.
I am also fascinated by tradition, customs and customs.
They care a lot about us here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technologies and latest trends -on the other hand: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I have never seen in my life.”
1. Rats also have feelings
A rat or a cockroach flees when they feel danger. Does that mean they also feel fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced that even many animals have feelings.
4. But how could it be if, when they behave in our same way, they have our same feelings?
In the Internet newspaper "Edge" for a few years are published articles of well-known scientists.
6. SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents chosen answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove it so far, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope, that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feeling or about consciousness in general, we enter an impracticable territory, because the reference base does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do. That is, it pretends to be dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from where some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make it difficult for us to convey our feelings towards animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often connected with human consciousness, the associated circuits (this is due to its direct participation in short-term memory and executive and control functions).
In man this large area is much more developed than in other primates and it seems that among other creatures it is completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness dependent on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, the foundation is thus admitted on the assumption that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should arise in man’s way of speaking: since a large part of life is connected to language, it is often said to be connected to consciousness.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
Although consciousness does not depend on language, it would influence it so that the animal’s consciousness, as it is done, certainly differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through their experience due to the special hardware, their search will cause us great problems.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness that science would find easier to access.
One could analyze the processes of animal consciousness without regard to their contents, and this is precisely what happens in studies on the short-term memory of primates, particularly in the example of visualization.
Therefore, by this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, one passes first to the neural correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: both may be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
What, then, is delineated by feelings?
I charge them with the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of its conscious brain activities.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system located in the brain (or its consequences, such as the body’s reactions) occupies the working memory.
Given this, the feelings are closely related to the regions of the cortex, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
With the speaking nature subtle nuances of feeling are created, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
In this regard, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that the feelings result from more primitive activities of the body regions of the sensations of the cortex and the cephalus, similar to Jack Pankseep, who, however, focused more on the palaeocephalus.
Since this network in the course of human evolution has not changed much, this could absolutely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level I cannot contradict it, but I consider it unprovable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to rats and humans as fear probably feels like that with the senses in both cases: but how could it occur, if rats and humans feel the same way when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach in case of danger flees as if he too felt fear?
In my eyes, the mere similarity of behavior cannot yet prove any vital similarity.
That is, the neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and humans have similar paleobrains, cockroaches not even a brain.
But is the paleoencephaly responsible for feelings?
And even if it could be proved for humans: how would you want to prove it on rats?
I think that rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
But I didn't know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than the emotional feelings of rats.
In any case, there is progress here at the neural level, as long as you give up the same procedure on rats and men.
Just as I don’t do research on language and consciousness in rats, so I don’t do research on their emotions, I don’t even know if they exist.
This may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than continually knocking against a wall.
I am an emotional practicalist.
The President of UEFA Platini: postponement for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Wasjunik said that the preparations will soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and in its ability to organise Europeans with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
The work has just begun and there is still a lot of work to be done in both countries.”
Both host countries hop on the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stadiums to be used by Europeans will even be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
Now we have to work at the highest speed,” said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigory Surkis.
"UEFA will keep an eye on us"
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals the direction of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the national Olympic committee and replaced with independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be "the serious danger that the PZPN will not be able to operate according to the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that preparations for the 2012 European Championships will not suffer."
Numerous members of the first division only last season were convicted of manipulation, in the end it was even necessary to postpone to the last moment the start of the League.
Dennis Quaid is indignant.
He wanted to promote a new film, in an interview he talked about the private and now has a crush on the former: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared his former Dennis Quaid adulterous.
He foams at anger and rebouts.
War of the Roses delayed breakup for former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors now wrestle with each other in an ugly quarrel - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with American magazine InStyle last week for the first time spoke about the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and this has been very painful."
The extent of the betrayals she would have come to know only after the separation.
The opportunity for the "soul rip" was working with Ryan's press for her new film "The Women" - it tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to her being publicly declared an adulterous husband was clear: it would be “unheard of,” the 54-year-old told the New York Daily News, which “Meg once again repeats and reworks the story of our relationship.”
It would also be "deplorable" that Jack, the sixteen-year-old son they had together, "be again publicly reminded of the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan lives alone from the breakup, Quaid is married again and soon becomes the father of twins.
And therefore his judgments close with the arrow: "My life in any case goes on.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family that goes all out for the best."
Prices drop for airline tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a current study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper
Hotel flights and overnight stays have again become more affordable – this is the result of a study by financial and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its bookings data for the first half of 2008 and after a price increase in the first quarter saw a noticeable drop in the second quarter.
After hotel market prices have been rising for years, overnight stays in many places have already fallen in price.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities still examined average around 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June prices were already 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
The American Express sees this as a reason for the weak dollar quotation, which would have led to a "calent desire to travel American tourists"
Financial centers such as Frankfurt and London would also be affected by the recession in hotel prices more strongly than industrial centers such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices with a 26.3% increase even hold the record in Europe
In terms of flight prices, the trend in the first quarter is still rising:
Due to the increase in kerosene, Economy Class passengers had to pay an average of 7.1% compared to 2007, long-haul flights would be up to 29.2% more expensive
From April to June, Economy Class ticket prices fell by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but in the first class and in the Business, price changes were much weaker.
In Germany, prices have plummeted even more than in other European countries:
From January to March prices had risen by 11,9 %, in the second quarter they fell by 23,6 %.
As for domestic German flights, according to the study, prices have even halved.
The reason for the fall in prices would be on the one hand the downturn in economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has crumbled.
On the other hand, there would be the open skies agreement, which liberalises air traffic between the United States and Europe, an increased pressure of competition.
A sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of unprofitable routes at the Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared bankruptcy – only in Europe there were 24 airlines.
HSV beats Gladbach 1-0
With a simple goal and methods the SV of Hamburg becomes a capolist.
At Borussia Luhukay still can not find a group of 11 that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsens the landing luck for the player of the national Marko Marin.
The Gladbach player first entered the game late and failed with a shot on the crossbar
His message was formulated with precision, it passed over his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger said in the hall of the Hamburg Arena.
It didn’t happen much in the catacombs, the game break was over and most of them sat back in their place.
Rieger has been an HSV physiotherapist for nearly 3 decades, enjoying an even greater esteem than certain old players.
And so his warning found even listening in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol nodded and raised his thumb as a sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similar: here's the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
“Not everything here was nice to see today,” Marcell Jansen later admitted.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "wanted to be more relaxed".
For the 1 to zero Hamburgers have to thank Mladen Petric (11) for the head blow and the fact that the many weak players of Gladbach could not hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"It was a dirty victory," Martin Jol summed up.
The SV of Hamburg this Monday will be 121 years old.
Spectators have already celebrated, in the afternoon of Saturday, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which has legitimized their sports society as before the class.
It will be a birthday without a real party.
“We can put everything in order,” said Marcell Jansen.
He has the feeling that the provisional certificate from the table is more an indication of the unpredictability of the championship than of the dominance of its HSV.
The team with its new late arrivals – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the defender of the Petric door as well as Jansen blown at FC Bayern – finds itself slowly, but it has not yet managed to shine.
“We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling,” Jol says.
After the defeat of the vote
There is fear on Wall Street.
The first news of the failure of the rescue package caused the Dow Jones to temporarily collapse by 700 points.
This was the biggest loss of points in the space of a day in its history.
Later, the down came back a bit.
Around 8:30 p.m. the world’s most important stock exchange barometer listed/received with a good 5% deficit on 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq Technology Exchange was firm with a deficit of more than 7% on 1548 points
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which put us back just 14%, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could do that.
The shares of Goldman Sachs have fallen by just 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, the great investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the venture.
As part of the rescue plan, financial funds had to be allocated for the seizure of the so-called mortgage documents.
The sum must be paid, however, not at once, but by degrees.
By the way, the state had to keep the Aktienoptsscheine of the financial companies, which could be redeemed with an adequate progress of the quotations, to reduce the charge for the state's cash registers.
The course of actions in Europe and the USA in the vortex of decline
Billions of aid to banks in Europe and the US do not erase investors’ doubts.
The stock price of the big German bank Hypo Real Estate plummets and tears the index of the German stock market down
The American Dow Jones Index returns despite the planned bailout of the financial market through the state.
Spectacular loss of the course of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have pulled the index of the German stock market into deep deficit.
The shares of the Munich real estate lender have lost despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks temporarily 3 quarters of their value, the Commercial Bank has yielded more than 20%.
The index of the German stock exchange DAX has slipped sharply below the psychologically important 6000 points and is quoted with a deficit of 3.7% on 5,839 points.
Global stock markets are falling to their knees.
In New York Wall Street opened with a clear deficit.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to bring financial markets back to growth.
The Dow lost in the first hour of business 334 points or 3.3% out of 10,809.25 points.
The American Chamber of Deputies wanted to vote on the bailout plan, the Senate vote could follow on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges were also able to follow only one direction: in London the FTSE index has fallen by 3.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris has lost 2.9%.
In Asia, the Nikkei benchmark index after initial profits had a deficit of 1.26% on 11,743.61 payers.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped by 2.1% to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9% and closed with 12,595.75 payers.
In MDax, Arcandor’s shares are sold after the announcement of an increase in capital.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim has signed new shares for an amount of 23 million.
The business and tourism group also announced that shares in Thomas Cook will not be sold.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has created confusion among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called Swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space for nearly 18 years.
Because of the fuel pipes that freeze quickly, it is now incumbent on her to die from freezing.
Among scientists for years a mysterious phenomenon creates trouble – the anomaly of the Swing-by
The Swing-by is a flight maneuver of space probes, with which they obtain additional momentum/spin/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The Euro-American research probe Cassini-Huygens used this physical expedient as well as the solar probe Ulysses.
What has amazed scholars for years is that rockets do not behave at all as one would expect under the law of gravitation.
In fact, there are irregularities in speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction force of matter with a curvature of space, might not be entirely accurate.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study firmly believes that before Einstein was wrong, and tries to explain the Swing-by anomaly by means of the so-called dark matter that astronomers have observed in the cosmos.
“Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter that could also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
The existence of dark matter has only been known to space scientists for about 10 years.
From her evidently emerges a force of attraction, the effect of which on other celestial bodies can be seen.
She herself is completely invisible, that is, she does not send or reflect any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter makes up at least one fifth of the entire mass of the cosmos.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt are free
After 10 days in the hands of their captors the kidnapped tourists in Egypt would be free again, as confirmed by the Italian foreign minister.
The kidnappers from Sudan had demanded several million euros in ransom.
In a shootout before the release, six kidnappers were found to have been killed.
Five Germans were kidnapped in southern Egypt.
The negotiations for redemption are already under way.
The Germans are always in the sights of the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and the Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the news of the Italian television broadcaster Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been released
We are examining their state of health," Frattini said.
The 5 Germans, 5 Italians and one Romanian as well as their 8 Egyptian companions would be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television reported.
The 19 members of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The background of a shooting that took place before the hostages were released remains unclear: so the kidnappers after the indications of an Egyptian public security officer would have been ready for the conclusion of the kidnapping, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them to the surprise.
“The problem had been solved.
They agreed to a ransom,” the official said.
It would be "still only a matter of taking over the hostages", when suddenly came "this surprise".
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had gunned down 6 of the kidnappers and captured 2 of them.
The kidnappers had demanded a ransom of 6 million euros from Germany; the money should have been handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" reported in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers wanted to release the women hostage after the ransom was paid.
The men would have to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
The abuse of the stepfather "led to suicide"
Years of abuse by the stepfather led to a woman killing herself, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians, Cornwall, was in prison for six years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
The Truro Court Crown Court learned that he regularly molested his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between the ages of five and seven.
Trerise wrote in a confessional note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had killed herself at her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a little girl living in Coventry, Trerise molested and blindfolded her before having sex, while her mother was out working in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Ms. Randle, who had spent a lot of time volunteering at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, Public Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Ms. Randle's friends, who had been a very good surfer and cyclist, were "emotionally dead", and that she had "moulded with life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
She is thought to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that ended: "I bound and bandaged her."
“I didn’t sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “She is an extremely strange fetishist, and for her victim it must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even harder is the fact that if he had not done so, it would have been difficult for the facts to have ended up in court.”
I notice the effects that Stephanie’s father and mother describe having had on their daughter over the years.
"Otherwise it was clearly likely that she had been a promising and successful happy young woman."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office official who left top-secret documents on a train in June must be charged with the Official Secrets Act, the BBC has learned.
The man was away from the Ministry of Defence when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the charges framed under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal intent.
BBC defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
"They will have thought that this was being dealt with internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause concerning the safeguarding of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service has recommended that the officer be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents he lost contained assessments of al-Qaeda and the capabilities of Iraq’s security forces.
He was informed of the decision Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies deal with the account of B&B
British construction companies could face an account of over <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The government has given <0xC2><0xA3>14 billion to protect the deposits of <0xC2><0xA3>2.6 million savers at Bradford & Bingley.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies that take money from savers, including the 59 construction companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) CEO Adrian Coles said it was "irritating" that companies and their members had to pay.
The <0xC2><0xA3>14bn loan will eventually be repaid when the Bradford & Bingley loans are repaid.
But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be paid every year to the 700 financial companies that take deposits. But the interest that will mature in the meantime will be charged every year to the 700 financial companies that accept deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently are now called upon to pay part of the bill to those institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find <0xC2><0xA3>81 million to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general manager of the association of construction companies, told the BBC he believes it is unfair.
“It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently in the recovering home market are now called upon to pay part of the bill to those institutions that have been far less prudent.”
According to the BSA, no company has failed since documentation began in 1945.
“We need to look at all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account,” Mr. Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of an entire year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk rises to 5 pence per litre
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be an increase in the wholesale price of its milk for an extra five pence per litre from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February, and comes after research carried out by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves whether they want to download the price increase on their customers.
(DANILO) Before the February increase, wholesale prices last changed in 2002.
Ex-Bangladesh Prime Minister's bail denied
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her a bail for extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) to a businessman when he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of the many corruption charges we are facing against her.
Sheikh Hasina's longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, had been released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina's return to Bangladesh is expected in the coming weeks but his party, the Awami League, has asked that the country's temporary government backed by the military give her total freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical care on the word, it is not clear under the terms of her release whether she will be able to remain at large when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
“The High Court has rejected the bail application for Sheikh Hasina claiming that she cannot have the bail since she is already abroad on the word for medical care,” says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will bring an appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
He expects Sheikh Hasina’s return home after October 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-backed government seized power, but was released in June, to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against them.
Fear for Afghan anti-polio campaign
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing from the recent immunization campaign due to Taliban-related violence, the UN says.
The U.N. carried out a vaccination program in six provinces last week.
But he is said to be unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said this was despite promises by the Taliban that they would not attack or obstruct thousands of staff carrying vaccines.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission’s decision to force the company to reduce its participation in the rival ITV television station.
BSkyB was told by the competition’s appeals court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Earlier, the commission had said that BSkyB's participation hindered competition and allowed an unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in an agreement that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the acquisition of BSkyB's stake in ITV casts doubt on ITV's independence, prompting the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin's chief, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special Public Prosecutor’s Office to examine the dismissal of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The operation took place when a report on the case by the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by fears that prosecutors had been removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
“Serious allegations of potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or substantiated,” Inspector General Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department said lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But later it emerged that the dismissed lawyers had not been rated more deficient than many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal had been motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in legal action against high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charge of fraud against Democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute cases in court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, found himself in the storm for dismissals, and eventually resigned his position.
A number of other officials in the Justice Department resigned.
(The Inspector General's report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales's role in the case, saying that he was a primary responsibility in the firings, which he had abdicated his leadership role and had been extraordinarily detached during the trial.
Other officials, including former Bush senior assistant Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The epic of Meat Loaf will be celebrated
The rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold award at next week's ceremony in London, said he was "honored" to earn the recognition.
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 album hit.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year's awards, being on the nominees list in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those.”
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocality that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf’s album Bat Out Of Hell remained on the charts for almost nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including an intervention for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on a vocal cord.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and perhaps soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other crossings, some famous, others merely of use.
But also many veteran taxi drivers and long-time residents find it difficult to give the location of Extra Place, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny road is in the East Village and runs north from the First Road – without making the Second Road – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty alley than a busy street.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal atlas.
The street, however, must have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of luxury buildings recently built on the First Street.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passageway for shops and boutiques that should open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were struck by the truncated road simply because it was one of the last remnants of the noble quarter of the past.
But the city’s Preservation and Development Department, which has control of the roads, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the land use committee of the municipal district commission some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the hands of the city, and has asked for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the district director of Community Board 3.
“There is very little space left to the city property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place,” he said.
"There may be proposals to fix it and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that it wanted to reopen the small road and install seating, including some to use for a café that the real estate company hopes to rent the space to.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the road was made public for the first time at this month's meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to use the road, it doesn’t necessarily mean it wants to own it.
“The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this derelict alley and turn it into a public amenity,” he said, adding that the city has suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a Housing Preservation spokesman, said it was in fact the city's desire to sell the road and noted that the agency's purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a slight historical imprint.
Some believe that it took its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was divided among his numerous children and the narrow strip of land was not reclaimed.
The back door to CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road is perhaps best known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The ground was beautiful," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was filled with garbage, clothes and bits of barrels, posters, leaves, ropes."
Some residents, including some bloggers who write of East Village "gentrification," have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the publicly owned piece, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of the city almost completely changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Complaints: A Little Nostalgic Look at the Dying City"), published part of a City History Discourse that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow alley with no exit, dark even by day and bounded warehouse doors in rusty iron and windows with sardines, with old weekly newspapers fluttering along the lowlands."
With few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same as a recent night.
A rat ran smoothly through the back of the street near a door leading inside the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls were graffiti and a 22-ounce empty beer bottle lying near a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passers-by said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest it would need to be a little embellished.
Mr. Fields, for his part, said he also thinks some people underestimate the attraction of the road in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “were in black, dirty, disgusting places.”
The Bilingual Debate: Immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidates’ position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior fellow in California studies and the senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not Good As You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose a School.”
Attracting Hispanic voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s education projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that, “African-American and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
To combat these shortcomings in achieving the goals, Obama’s education plan specifically supports, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English students.
Yet the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes classroom teaching in languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in bridging learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in eastern Los Angeles County.
The students of the school are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among fourth graders, an astonishing 100 percent of students took the upper-level test in the 2008 math state exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of fourth graders took the expert-level test on the art-of-language-English.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama’s favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes review and exercise, constant assessment of skills and an attitude of the "no excuses" type.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s obstructive approach to English students is “full immersion.”
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “We had a fantastic success with a student just coming from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you wouldn’t have been able to pinpoint which one it was.”
"It works," he noted, "for us it works."
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Hispanic-majority schools and with English students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy in his own party (the National Education Associations is a longtime supporter of bilingual education) and his own continued support for bilingual education prevent him from predicting Mr. Obama's answer.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the argument banal when he said that people should stop worrying about “only-English” legislation.
Instead, he said, "you have to make sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these achievement gaps, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than disparaging or trivializing them.
Oil falls sharply and renews economic fear
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to boost the economy.
Oil futures fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel at the New York Stock Exchange in morning trading.
Prices have lost more than $20 a barrel since last Monday.
Over the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the financial turmoil of Wall Street, and by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After peaking at $145.26 a barrel in June, prices had plummeted to nearly $90 a barrel earlier this month, before rising another time, amid tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety affected investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders said they had reached a weekend agreement on the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy Wachovia Corporation's banking operations, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the hectic weekend trades had led to a bailout deal "seem to have failed to revive the sentiment of the market.
As the economic situation worsens, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to ease.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and foreign exchange markets has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape infection.
From a raw material perspective, our most pressing concern is how far the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Bank analysts have lowered their expectations for next year as oil consumption home due to slowing economic growth, reducing oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter sets a team record.
After spending more time than anyone with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter of Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless game into a comeback.
"I've never seen anything like it," Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals equaled the grayness of the menacing clouds that overtook them with a mediocre game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon when their growing attunement took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the fourth, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
"I didn't get out of my path," Favre said of all the passages that reached Coles.
He's a great player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people may think.”
While Favre and Coles were playing catchy games, the defense hit Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner hard.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a vagrant pitch and re-launched it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith predicted another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens forces a fumble from Warner.
The last turnover, the fumble forced by Bowens, may have been the most notable.
The Cardinals went ahead on that possession of the ball, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets picked up the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard goal, for a 34-0 lead.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, “The second quarter or the third quarter?”
When he was told both - the Jets conceded 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can tell you I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third."
There were a lot of points in a small amount of time."
Gebrselassie rested surpasses his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia showed again why many consider him the best marathoner ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon on Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2-mile race under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a win on the race favorably flat in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie smashed his previous score of 2:03:26, which he ran last year in Berlin, for 27 seconds.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie set the 26th world record for such an amazing career that he produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic marathon, fearing – perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect – that air pollution would worsen her asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to race in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at departure, 55 degrees at arrival - Gebrselassie won on Sunday with a scorching average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half fondists like Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have gone the long distance, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decades, since Ronaldo from Costa del Brazil won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s win, Gebrselassie told reporters he had calf cramps two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left him fresh, not rusty.
"I'm so happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but in the end everything went well."
He has been somewhat criticized - especially in Kenya, Ethiopia's East African rival - for over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world's top marathon stars, relying on the runway as if it were a cross-country race, and putting world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s skills as a marathon runner.
With the pace cadenced by four Kenyans on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the halfway point in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, held Gebrselassie in competition after the freeways disappeared.
Just over three miles from arrival, Gebrselassie made a final push to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi came third in 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Britain’s Paula Radcliffe holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but was healed to win in Berlin, making her personal best time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, letting a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners leave with a big break, picking them up after about 18 miles and a half.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the extensive theme park in the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendour, the noise, the huge, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience enter life.
Eatonville, the first all-black city incorporated into the country and Zora's birthplace, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, Harlem Renaissance’s most famous writer.
Yet in many ways, the city that he described—and that stops tourists understanding it in the Florida tourist guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers’ Project—remains a place apart.
It is so independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, who “knowing so little of us, doesn’t know what’s being lost.”
Even now, in a year where a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called for an opening address on race, many here remain wary of the outsider’s look.
“We are very cautious about how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
"It must be fair."
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historical model of black empowerment and a community of nearly 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shadow of the oaks of the rural black culture of the South - sometimes disdainful, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really began with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida’s guide turned the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through Florida’s often-forgotten center into a scenario of black history and human drama.
Low as a crane in both life and literature, Hurston took readers to the shop owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then detoured to more private areas.
"Out of the street to the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-maintained gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always looked after, thinking he could barely read and write."
She also mentioned the widow's new husband Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "sells drinks of all kinds and whatever suits the passage rooms".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriage and sex.
Clearly, this was not Fodor's.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
“Zora was saying it like it was,” said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of Johnson’s girls who Hurston immortalizes by citing men singing coarse songs about their beauty.
He adds: "Some people don't like it."
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned from her family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalls that when Hurston was in town, he usually arrived without warning in a triumphant Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts decent clothing.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others sighed.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin said.
But, he added, leaning on his back patio chair over Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed long."
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had gone out of print.
Along with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she had lived.
In Eatonville, there were no major memorial ceremonies, and no major conferences.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane road.
Orlando's expansion has already pushed Interstate 4 across the city's western boundary.
The proposal came as Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended the idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the community’s doorstep.
“During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things at people sitting on one side,” says Mr. Franklin.
“In fact, we had a girl who was killed by that one time.
They threw a coconut tree out of a car."
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his Brown decision against the school office "an insult rather than an honor to my race".
Residents now say that school desegregation, despite being positive in some respects, dilutes Eatonville’s cohesion and jeopardizes the confidence of its youth.
“Black kids were used to being hugged — I remember this — you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until teachers and students came from the same place.
"You didn't embrace your white teacher because your white teacher -- I mean, there's a cultural divide there," Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped and created space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons - black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudices, as she did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines like: "How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I just don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to the unmarked tomb of Hurston and began fighting for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Robert E. Hemenway's Hurston hit the bookshelves, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project came just as his most famous daughter had once again turned on the lights of the overpass.
And this time, Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a lifesaver.
The community began designing a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state pulled back from its road project.
“The five lanes of the resurrected highway have brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Mrs. Boyd puts it more simply: "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the highway project helped change the city’s self-image.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the public historical register in 1998.
A new one-story bookstore (named Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a re-paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feeling of a side street under the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1980s.
(It's 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to look for Eatonville’s story, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit requested in advance is required for most of the interviews, to some things – such as the murals on Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man, showing black men in the fields – they are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weakness for bright red, still fear that their island community will be misunderstood.
Yet, as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of civic pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing his entire race: beautiful, trouble and everything, no better, no worse and proud, creative, great worker, stupid and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s grandson, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, which he said may need help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“A lot of people, if they just walked in here, will think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’” Alondra Kenon said after Mass on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it’s really a pretty city.”
Here in New York we all speak fluently of finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspaper stalls and the huge television screens of Times Square, they wouldn’t notice they were in the eye of the storm.
They would never guess that glass offices, honeycombs over their heads bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York City live every day the worst “bad day in the office” since the 1929 collapse.
Factories shake metal carts for tea through sidewalks, carrying muffin trays for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken ironed shirts hanging from a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the food carts on the sidewalks, and it is still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 on a working day.
It didn’t seem like there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings book on Thursday afternoon.
Although I had planned the matter so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a queue of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier's counter, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service counter, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask directions for the Macy's department store and new customers open accounts.
Many of those in front of me, I would have learned later from Starr, my “trust banker,” were in line for my own reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken the savings from the smaller banks from the places from which they make the commuters, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They took the money from so-called thrifts (a bit like a construction company), credit unions, and types of city savings banks whose subsidiaries operate only within a state, and they say they treat customers like family.
In the past few years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days the Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, has been subjected to controlled administration, and, as New Yorkers headed home for the weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a buyer who saved her.
The clerks and clerks who stood before me, afraid of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe harbor, the bank that is asking for more bail on Wall Street.
The common New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and its emaciated CEO Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if complaining about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed gatekeeper, almost fifty years old in my condo, has changed the subject from our normal conversation topic about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my groceries.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I’ve changed, I’m not taking any risks.”
Desecrated Muslim graves as Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, to the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry road signs like those representing mosques with a red line passing in the middle.
Police blamed right-wing extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties made a lot of money in national general elections.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged at the Traun cemetery, near Linz, sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The culprits spray-painted Jewish symbols like the Star of David over some graves, but the detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motivations driven by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear if the incident is somehow related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were “deeply shocked” by the news of the desecration, which took place towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious significance for Muslims.
Austria, meanwhile, embarked on a spiritual quest following its turn to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, have campaigned with vehemently anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans have been defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against veils and burqas and also voiced his opposition to foods that are perceived as connected to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties appear to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, citing them as political symbols of a continued Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses made immediately after the election, which established the far right as the nation’s strongest political bloc, indicated that the change was brought mostly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad forbidden to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamorous rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, has been banned from travelling to France and Spain from court.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed authorities that he wanted to go to Spain via France.
The ban on travel abroad was granted to Kent police last Thursday after it provided judges with evidence of Glitter's previous arrests for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadi, was not present at the hearing at Ashford Prefecture in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: “On Thursday 25 September at Ashford Prey, Kent police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd’s travel abroad to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as requested by the sex offender registry.
He must notify the authorities if he wishes to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give the police a seven-day notice on his scheduled departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may lead to a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they did not want to discuss individual cases or Glitter's possible movements in the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: “The Kent police will do whatever it takes to protect children in this country or abroad.
“From our point of view, it’s easier to control someone who stays in the UK because we have suitable comprehensive systems to manage every potential risk more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is the primary concern of Kent police and we are working closely to monitor the conduct of convicted sex offenders registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two girls aged 10 and 11.
When Glitter arrived he flew to Bangkok where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt ill and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not let him pass to passport control and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
Even the Chinese authorities did not let him in and he returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He eventually arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Prep, west of London, as Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to place him on the sex offenders register.
Glitter had previously been jailed in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A Interior Ministry source said Jacqui Smith, the interior secretary, felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character" G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer, photographer
Neither heels nor steering wheel nor dresses from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in private, in those moments far from the audience, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots to singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the lesser known side of these masters.
With this objective, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, capturing it from different visual angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, every day increasing," explains the artist and explains that in "Flamenco-People" they could also be ordinary people, but seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the stage.
These people portrayed “on the road” are “artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they’re on stage ... and capture the audience.
To capture the personality of these greats it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
because their personality and character are internal.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture with the camera the personality of the flamenco greats."
With a passion for the festival "Cante de las Minas", Bauer began in 1997 a long journey aimed at portraying singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the type of machine and the material, resemble classical photography.
The application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of the image, giving the photo modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's own conception of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not dancing, singing or playing in itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, able to conquer the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata gallery.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, appear in this selection of about seventy portrait artists.
The project has become a sort of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited on the occasion of the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veterans Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love to portray people, to know them and to be able to penetrate for a moment into their lives, whether this is a long or a short moment.
I think portraiture is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or confront people, characters that you sometimes don’t even know or that give you only a few minutes to take the photo.
“Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to put my ideas into practice.”
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the gallery El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata, at number 20 of Via de la Mata, parallel to Via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until October 16.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a "gambling"
It is set in places he does not yet know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is facing a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and crossed the Amazon.
Always a favorite for the Nobel Prize for Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is a gamble" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had good sense, I would not write it, but I will do it anyway and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as predicted, the leading figure at the third edition of the word festival.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens’s book “Our mutual friend”, filled the seats of the Juan Bravo theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer has found himself in front of an audience to whom the time has flown when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great memory of humor, evoked in him the literary vocation, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "to live as a writer" in an intense way.
The Spanish-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, arguing that, on the contrary, "has effects" and that "makes them more accountable."
Time hinders the Festival of Pozoblanco, depriving it of the corridas
The celebration of the bullfights that should have sealed the days of the Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the bullfighters selected for the bullfights had verified that the ground conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather got tough against this Festival, preventing it from celebrating two days out of three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second bullfight from taking place.
The posters included Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were supposed to face a bull of Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival was held regularly only on Fridays.
On this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting off three ears and being brought out in triumph, after having toreated with taste and aesthetics.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante completed his two races with greetings and an ear, granted more by the public than due to the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pity.
With the second bull, after a tremendous crutch, he earned the whistles of much of the audience.
A van with two thousand kilos of hashish crosses the checkpoint in Alava
Five minus ten in the morning.
Officers call the two occupants of a van who, instead of stopping, run away.
Officers ordered the two occupants of a van to flee instead of stopping.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The officers, after chasing them, manage to arrest one of the two occupants, a man of about 28 years, identified as A. A. J., according to a statement from the Basque government's Interior Department.
The arrested individual is accused of drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The accident occurred when some officials on the Alava road were carrying out a transport control on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver, breaking orders, abruptly accelerated and passed the checkpoint.
Officers went on the chase until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the side of the road and its two occupants fled to a wooded area.
The agents of the Ertzaintza managed to arrest one of the fugitives and seize the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and took note of once they inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish buns, which were located in the back of the vehicle, were subsequently placed in police custody for in-depth investigation and weight detection.
Moreover, since officials found that the license plate had been "duplicate" because it did not match the one in the truck's documentation, the arrestee was also charged with the crime of falsifying public documents.
The Ertzaintza is continuing investigations to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old inmate, A. A. J., was taken to the police station to carry out appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under the Effect of Drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky maneuvers while trying to get out of the parking lot in Montecito by car, according to a California road spokesman.
The witness specified that around 16.30 the Locklear "squeezed the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, and trying to bring the car out of the parking lot with abrupt maneuvers back and forth.
Shortly after, the witness, who at first glance apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped in a nearby street and had exited the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because "she was worried about Locklear's life."
When the police patrol arrived, she found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"She looked confused," and that's why the agents took her to a drug and alcohol use center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress has shown collaboration and the hypothesis of excess alcohol has been discarded from the beginning, although "according to what was observed by the officers at first, we believe that Locklear was under the effect of some drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effect of some unspecified substance and was locked up in the local prison around 7 p.m., to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was re-established by a specialist clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian federation of the IU to assume its responsibilities in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the UI and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional federation of training to make a decision on the case of the former adviser to the Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientism.
"In these cases I am particularly federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that has to take on its responsibilities," said Llamazares regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt in relation to what has been so far an adviser in the Seville council.
However, the leader of the UI stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted that this type of investigation we have the maximum transparency."
He also stressed that the training is regulated by "very strict ethical codes for all public offices."
"Blood of May", the epic bet of Garci
Inspired by Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s’s Episodios Nacionales, Jose Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD> re-enacts in Sangre de Maio the famous revolt of the Spanish against the French, in what is the most ambitious film of his filmography, with almost 15 million euros of budget.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the head of a wide cast of performers.
Sangre de Mayo, more than two and a half hours long, debuts this Friday in the cinemas, to become in the future a television miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
Great admirer of the literature of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, Jose Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a claims to have realized with this shot "a dream of his childhood", and believes that he must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before shooting a commemorative film for the second centenary of the 2nd of May.
The 15 million budgets allocated entirely by the Community of Madrid represented for Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a a "unique opportunity" to recreate the appropriate scenery and costumes to portray a "a stunned Spain that misjudged the choice of leader to fight for and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a VII.
However, the director regrets not having received funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than double that of Sangre de Mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes provided by the set design that he had signed together with Horacio Valcarcel, collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Back to Work, has influenced what is his usual working practice, staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before shooting together with those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's work lies in going to the theater and knowing what is happening in the industry."
Many of the performers, some of whom are part of the cast of Sangre de mayo, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy - his Sangre de Maio, Siete mesas de billar francés and, the last selected Los girasoles ciegos - should represent the younger generation of Spanish cinema.
From this film Garci does not expect awards.
“At first you think you’re working for posterity, then you realize you’re working only for prosperity, and at some point you settle for just shooting one more film,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Seville essence of the ballerina Tortola Valencia
A dancer from Seville pays tribute to another dancer from Seville as well.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Florence Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and at the age of three moved with his family to London.
She was a free dance dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, of the caliber of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, who marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
"I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she proposed this character to me. It seemed incredible."
She says: “We don’t want to tell her whole life, we want to capture her spirit.
The titles of his dances suggested some basic elements of flamenco to me.
So, "the butterfly dance" suggested to me a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tanghi.
His dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing is also part of this aesthetic,” she explains.
The staging includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing Isabel again in one of his shows, as she does in "La puerta abierta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with what had been a pupil of hers.
Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I’m happy because he accepted to work in my work and I feel very honoured about that.”
The set-up also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the percussions of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez "who plays the role of eternal companion of these spa artists who have always been to."
In the work there is also in some form the life of this woman who takes place in distant places, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all of Europe, because, usually, she lived in London.
“I wanted to remember her because I think she is one of the women who has had a huge impact in a given historical period and now no one remembers her, let alone considers her work as something of value,” Bayon said.
The show will begin today, at 8.30 pm at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
With the publication of the "Diario de un poeta recién matado" (Diary of a newly married poet), the Triennial also closes.
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities planned by the Council of Culture of the Junta of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennio del Zenomor and Juan Ramon's anniversary" (2006-2008), which he organized as the fifth anniversary of the year.
Thus, the "Triennio di Zenobia e Juan Ramon" concludes with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the house-museum of the Nobel and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated several times last May, and which will then have the International Conference in New York.
In addition, the Council of Culture of the Junta of Andalusia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the Andalusian poets of the highest value.
America likes it a little less without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Ausencia de malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman left.
It cost him a lot to win an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
He also knew that he was very ill.
Despite this, it was a very hard blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels goes beyond any expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country have been better because of its existence.”
No one was afraid to be ridiculous or exaggerated.
A father of cinema and the homeland has died in a particularly dark time, out of fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on the ground, in desperate search of new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men so without virtue and people well to admire, it is not necessary to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, it embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and an advocate for lost and won causes, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the first-born dead of overdose to the creation of the brand of home and organic food.
All gifts to a country that has cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, taking care of neither nationality nor passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, observed that not a man has died, an era is over.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing short of the pinnacle of his career.
The bad guy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has come to terms with Paul Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He left a very high-level example for all of us," notes George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who today tries to live as Paul Newman did: keeping in high regard the need for righteousness and to have a serious and remote private life.
This is not always easy or possible in today’s media jungle.
However, some try it and Paul Newman sets a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful although he certainly did not miss the opportunities not to be.
"Why am I going out to eat hamburgers today, if I have a steak at home?" he used to joke.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
“Among all the great roles he played, no one was as proud as a devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather, and passionate philanthropist,” they say.
The imperfect race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I would say no!
They called it the "perfect race", but in my opinion it was by far the worst I've ever seen.
A lot of nonsense, which if they were later taken into account at the time of the evaluation and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go by order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense began with the withdrawal of the dorsal, which assumed that you would go before.
It didn’t seem like a bad idea, but if you’re forced to go, it’s to pick up everything (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
No, not really.
You had to go only to take the dorsal (first stupidity, go only for this) and (after the relative tail), surprise! they had only T-shirts of size 'S' (second stupidity, because I need a size XL).
What world do we live in?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small t-shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are inequities compared to the very day of the race.
In addition to having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race that more than 11,000 people are waiting for.
So, as was predictable, the race started that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once successful in the enterprise, the recovery turned out even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts of popular rebellion and assault at the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even be in the ranking in the correct order because of the chip that, I suppose, did not correctly register the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me for the perfect race, it will certainly not enter my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft search receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT conference on emerging technologies, Microsoft previewed a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, able to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move within the company's campus phone).
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this receptionist is able to know how many people are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and to listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group people in conversation groups.
In the example video the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that he does not belong to the group he is talking to and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is there to visit someone and tells her that she will be at his disposal soon.
All without blue screenattack.
Impressive.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about a strategy change at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with essential and less-charged functions of commercial junk, they would go five times faster – hey! Steve, it will be for “the least.”
A whole discovery, if you take into account that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows features and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is losing more and more importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome in the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that Google was the first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an essential element for the hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
That's true.
It will never disappear, but perhaps it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative one.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You take your computer just to launch Explorer or Firefox – or Chrome – and every day we spend more time surfing the web than in a remote windowed environment.
What is the use of half of the applications in the operating system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overload, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services to make them a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need for it, in fact, and I give a small example here.
I took the photo posted in this post at one of Microsoft’s employee recreation facilities in Redmond earlier this month.
On the beverage machine a sign prompts them to use their own search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to conduct a web search.
Last week, however, the delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be launched in early 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not in 2010.
Microsoft will definitely try to jointly launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The mobile phone, after all, is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is penalizing.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso brought her to the C<0xC3><0xB4>te d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's 'Diamante de sangre', as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' as well as being part of the typical uniform of the muscular gay parish.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of the stars, we can evoke the image of the forced with pointed mustaches that lift the weights in the walking circus.
It is, in essence, the typical men's t-shirt, with the interior of cotton, fitted and sleeveless.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglophones call it, although the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out among them all.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the t-shirt carry as detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" excels compared to the others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive coat of arms and for the small Belgian flag (just recognizable), which the most emblematic t-shirt models carry as detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company does not only concern the famous "tanks".
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxer shorts, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, navy t-shirts, baby-dolls, mini shorts...
Intimate clothing designed to be comfortable.
And it's a shame to use them as underwear.
They're too pretty.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry me"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new fashion business very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who lend their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango firm made of its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
Warm and shy, it conquers you quickly.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for the autumn-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let’s say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
What elements does your new collection for Mango start from in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I like the cinema of the '50s and '60s, from here we get various inspirations.
Then, I love to get lost in the city and watch how women dress, how they combine and mix their own clothes. I do it frequently.
Ballerina, actress and stylist, you're a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, although in the end, it all comes together and there are many elements in common.
When I was a little girl, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to snuggle in my aunt’s closet and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, better even than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to dressing.
It is known that dancers really like to have their own style to go to class and to the wise, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when you are handed the wardrobe is the moment when you really meet the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionals.
Not long ago, you turned 30, you got into a crisis?
Oh, no.
Never felt better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to enjoy life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn't scare me.
I did the things I wanted to do when I was little and this gave me a lot of inner happiness.
So you think you're going to be a mother, don't you?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my own body asks for it and I also want to be a young mother, this I do not want to lose.
As for the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you are waiting for several films shot last year to come out in the theaters.
Just like that, and I really want them out.
Being a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it can not always be so.
I want "The Last Hour" and "In Search of the Tomb of Christ" to come out.
Let's see if you like it
A few days ago you debuted on the catwalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not like I was on the runway as a model.
Just Naomi Campbell, who I’ve known for a long time, invited me to go to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization “Women for a Better World” and the clothes we exhibited – I brought two pieces of our Mango collection – were auctioned to raise funds for this NGO of Naomi.
People don't know this sweet side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her that I have known her for a long time and I can confirm that they are not so true.
Also, I find myself with this good part that you're involved in.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he asked me to do the pine, I would have done the same.
If it’s to help third world women, you can’t pull yourself back.
Relapsed drivers of alcoholism will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of Interior requires that drivers with three administrative sanctions for excessive alcohol in the blood, install in his car the system that prevents driving the vehicle in a state of intoxication or if it does not blow in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the Attorney General’s Office, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The purpose of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since this will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the General Prosecutor’s Office for Road Safety, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers reported more than once for drunk driving then return to driving the car.
The alkock would avoid it, because it is a vehicle-connected system that measures the rate of alcohol in the exhaust air and prevents the car from starting if the driver is not blowing, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is detected than allowed.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be at the expense of the sanctioned.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices allow to reduce up to 65% of the infringements committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to curb these behaviors before they become criminal offenses.
And to facilitate its development, since the legal reform can be carried out in an ordinary way, and, undoubtedly, the reform necessary for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been experimentally introduced in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on an initiative of the PSOE in which it is proposed to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without "peep-toes"
At 5:40 p.m., the Spanish plane carrying the Princes of Asturias landed in the presidential hangar at Mexico City's Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez Airport.
The sun was setting but the rays still forced the hand to use as a visor to see the royal couple get off the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the street, if he knew that the Spanish princes were going to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you can't go to the airport to load people in that moment ... You're from here or ...
No, no, sir, you're Spanish, but you lived here for a couple of years.
- Ah, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the principles of Asturias are and the importance of travel.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar crushed to the red carpet and military cordon composed of 27 marines offering the salute of honor.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the princess, limping in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," perhaps they told her that in Mexico City threatened bad weather.
They give the photographers a smile and a short stop before passing into the room where the official entourage awaits them.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four largest in the city, a witty reporter of Mexican television awaits them.
The best prize offered by fashion
Probably there is no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, which is not Paris and probably there is no more exquisite designer and bont vivan than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, to foster the international promotion of new talents in the field of fashion.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her drawings in the Mango showcase at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
Moreover, it is the company’s second store by size in Europe and has just been opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first one is in London.
The many events, combined with the desire to please the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the competition, began with a luxury dinner at the Opera Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal’s most exquisite canvases, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Born, heartbroken and in need of virtue, due to the recent death of his brother, he wore a House dress and some ELAH accessories to take his breath away and to the arm of his son Luis - a boy almost two meters tall - accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors at home and as a knight which he finished, together with Baron Rotchil, without jacket, because they had both given them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the store in pants and shirts – drawn by her hand – turned out for dinner, wearing a long, very sensual black dress and got excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us a room for the ballet saxophones and she plied another one.
Inés Sastre did not stop for the walk in the premises of the palace, but had shown us before the photos of his son on his mobile phone.
The next day we were delighted by the presence of Olivier Martinez – another boy who is moving on a motorcycle – and of John Travolta, who had arrived at the Hotel Intercontinental in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and had previously made sure that there were no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and a way to forget the chaotic and frantic daily life.
And as if that wasn’t enough, they are all collected in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it rings every morning at 7, but it is even worse to imagine yourself involved in the hectic pace dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the difficulty of letting go of the world of work.
No, this number amounts to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, all a "menu" of options tailored to the taste and time of each.
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 Ways to Relax" and its calmness will reach the bookstores thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to conquer calm in areas such as work or personal relationships, this "manual" denies such a belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as staying in touch with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline doesn’t already flow into your veins to regain body balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind, and focus on reading.
Talking in sleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but to those children who talk while staying asleep.
The first time it happens, at most you get a scare, but in reality it does not matter much.
It is a benign alteration of sleep called somniloquial.
It manifests itself with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Certainly, most of you have been told that you spoke in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in a lifetime, for example associated with an episode of high fever) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the day after the child remembers nothing anymore.
There is no single reason that can explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, nighttime enuresis (doing pee in bed), or sleepwalking, but not necessarily so.
As already mentioned above, it can be associated with very high fever stages, situations of stress or overexcitement.
In any case, it is a phenomenon still little studied.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks in a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper or that the opposite happens (crying, shouting, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and possibly consult a specialist to check if there is any question that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as a result of the situation.
We have said that it is a benign alteration therefore there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stress situation).
What can be done, however, is to take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excessively excite the child before going to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid programs or television series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is exhausting to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them gain some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more peacefully.
Once the sleepyheads appear try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of what happened.
Useful advice
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you would interrupt his sleep.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if it appears very anxious and the episodes have a certain frequency, it is better to consult a doctor or check where such a great anxiety in the child comes from.
If you understand what he’s saying (which isn’t the most common situation), don’t fall into the temptation to interrogate him for information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore not conscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what he is saying but not see what he is dreaming to say, so you need to pay close attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which it could lead.
Never tell your child that you could ask them questions during the night to know their secrets.
Not even for a joke.
This kind of thing causes a lot of anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s nothing serious, it’s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... finally
The Illhaeusern has finally found its way home after a long unsuccessful period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-Blacks created the most networked opportunities, turning one into the game’s win.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting in which the attackers expressed themselves in difficulty.
After a first attempt by the captain of the guest team Kauffmann who touched the seven with a shot from afar, the Ilhlaeusern began to get the best and one after another provoked the defense of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick from afar, then Hirn high, Romain high and again Diebold.
The Dannemarie responded with a midfield block, leaving only the fired Riahi at the point of attack.
The start of the second half was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the first Marais net for the well-placed Ilhlaeusern, he picked up a rejected ball on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the Ilhlaeusern gunner will not be able to enjoy his happiness for long and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But the Dannemarie will not be able to take advantage of it and will not pose great problems to the Eleven of the Ilhlaeusern, retreated just to "strengthen" the defense, except in the last minutes of the game when, after a rocky action, the ball touched the cross.
Sarkozy meets fishermen in anger
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will make a stop in Britain.
At a demonstration of fishermen who on Monday brutally blocked access to several Breton and Norman ports, the President of the Republic decided to go on Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, to enchant its representatives.
The latter have promised to welcome him "in a constructive spirit" and hope that he will "present himself with concrete proposals".
A presidential visit that takes place at the same time as the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by the Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the surge in the price of diesel, which has reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per liter.
Eliseo spokesman David Martinon said the president would “discuss with them about possible solutions to help their businesses regain competitiveness and to make the working conditions and remuneration of seafarers safe.”
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, they conducted "slug operations" in Morbihan and Calvados, causing nearly 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections with Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le were not interrupted.
On the Quiberon peninsula a roadblock has been implemented.
On Monday, sailors have already demonstrated their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots at the ports of Brest and Lorient, as they staged demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the fishing vessels remained at the pier, or to Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe et del Croisic, near the Loire Atlantic, interrupted in the evening the blockade of the famous refinery Total of Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting that will be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support the movement.
"The strike will continue" because "fishers will not give up" and "they have no intention of moving to Paris", announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, president of the Lorient fishing committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per liter, but estimate that the yield limit of a boat is reached only with a diesel of less than 0.30 euros per liter.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
"Butch Cassidy" has died of cancer at the age of 83 at his Connecticut home.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and again Sam Mendes welcomed the film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains delivery forecasts in 2008
The aircraft manufacturer has 215 deliveries this year, despite the threats of recession that weigh on the world economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth-largest airline, maintains its delivery forecast for 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, its president Frederico Fleury Curado confirmed.
During the first half of the year, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, especially for aircraft in the range between 30 and 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would divest more than 15% of its assets
The insurance company American International Group, set up by the US monetary authorities, would divest more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
The AIG is ready to consider the sale of much of its business, in addition to the sale of life insurance to the international market and the United States, the newspaper said on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The AIG Board of Directors met on Sunday evening to consider possible divestments, according to the FT.
No confirmation has been received from AIG.
The assets AIG intends to divest include the International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT adds.
No final decision has been taken on these transfers, the FT continues.
The AIG must quickly find liquidity in order to repay the 85 billion grantee loan from the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing the US authorities seize 80% of its capital.
Paris: cronistoria Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange blamed a historic crash on Monday, after the House of Representatives spoke out against the Paulson Plan for rescuing financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, or a never-before-seen drop, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) ended at 10,365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) higher than that of September 17, 2001, the day of the reopening of the Stock Exchange following the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq, the index of major technology stocks, lost 199.61 points closing at 1,983.73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 lost 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) closing at 1,106.55, according to the definitive closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection of the bank bailout plan, designed to restore stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against the plan and 205 in favor, the representatives rejected the funding requested by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
About two out of three Republicans have rejected the plan.
"It's a negative signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, of FTN Financial.
"All of this signals how much the market counted on the project," he added, fearing that in a few days it might already be "too late" to adopt one.
“If the project were actually dying ... then the witness would be quickly passed on to the Fed — the Federal Reserve — and other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight.
And further highlighting the state of emergency, "every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution" in the United States, stressed Piegza.
After the failure of Washington Mutual on Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking assets by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, urging urgent intervention in favour of the banks of the United Kingdom, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that markets "are not only facing an American crisis, but a global crisis," added the analyst of FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds fell to 3.632 percent from 3.82 percent on Friday night, while the 30-year yield was 4.161 percent from 4.357 percent the day before.
Obama in favor of the first TV duel
After Friday’s first debate between the two White House candidates, here’s a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Unsurprisingly, the Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed the respective victory of the television duel, followed by a third of American families.
Political scientist David Gergen believes that McCain’s performance, while meritorious, was not bright enough to allow him to curb the decline in polls five weeks after the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, of which an opinion poll published Saturday gives Obama a five-point advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows the Democrat had the best.
An instant poll conducted by CBSNews on a sample of undecided voters found that 39% of them consider Obama the winner, while 25% point to McCain.
An excellent performance by his longtime running mate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, is expected to confirm Obama’s lead on Thursday.
“Underestimating it would be a mistake.
He’s got a good gut,” Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
The 70-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his indisputable experience in foreign policy, underlining the opponent's "jealousy" regarding the issues addressed during the first face-to-face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that,” he often stated on multiple occasions.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and skills to become president,” he said.
What has been a constant target for the Republican television campaign since yesterday.
Obama, for his part, stressed that his election would represent a new future.
Without elongating, it proved concise and precise.
He promoted his willingness to make the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
“McCain never understood, unlike Obama,” he retorted, this weekend, a Democratic spot, reprimanding the Republican for failing to take the necessary steps to deal with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, in a pouring rain, for an electoral meeting.
He hasn't even uttered the words "middle class" or "workers." The financial crisis is in Obama's favor, considered by Americans as the most fit person to save the economy on the brink.
“Next week could be a turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s economic insight to that shown by Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse “is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain.”
Reiterating his intention to reduce taxes for 95 percent of Americans despite the Wall Street riots, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of a possible energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energy and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a park of 45 nuclear centers by 2030.
Cautiously, the two candidates sidestepped the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial bailout-focused questions adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, "did you not notice that there were elections?"
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday evening in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge the results of the legislation in advance.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered on Sunday evening just after the closing of the polling stations in the central square of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While the results were still awaited, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resignation".
Some confess that they did not even vote: "What for? They will do whatever they want, of my vote," says one boy.
They do not believe that the regime which has made its first appearance to foreign observers in order to resume dialogue with the European Union is ready to take a democratic turn.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of assets, could be lifted if these elections were deemed legitimate by observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been removed from the electoral commissions and our observers have not been able to participate in the vote-free process," said Iuri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse alliance of twelve parties.
“It’s a change of face,” said Alexandre Milinkievich, a former candidate of the opposition to the 2006 presidential elections and the head of the pro-European movement, because the important thing is who counts the cards and in this case is the executive.
If opposition MPs enter Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can involve a television space, regional meetings, and bills.”
The opposition therefore has a duty to get into the political game because "we need to start a dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not provide any reform, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
Now we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, will recognize the validity of the vote.
He points out that the participation rates seem too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) has given way to any type of manipulation.
"Have you noticed that there were elections?" asks the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year, in August.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition MPs in parliament, the most convenient to power."
The silence of the night falls on the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission are pleased with their success.
The meeting - The blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated the tenth anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Dr. FrancineDécary, had every reason to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it has regained public trust, seriously shaken by the blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with the acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such drama and popular protests, the Government of Canada conducted a public inquiry in February 1994, directed by Judge Horace Krever, which aimed to shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to disseminate recommendations to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster.
While Judge Krever was late in drawing up a report, some provinces set up a committee with the goal of designing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) for all other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its activities, only 38% of people said that they still had confidence in the donation system in Quebec, recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was mortifying.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood samples and field research over the next few years, we have regained public confidence,” she explains before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Quebec’s population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, is convinced that "trust is something extremely fragile".
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases of the human variant of the mad cow in Europe, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the woman who has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of its foundation.
“And we didn’t know at all if that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It was therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when you have doubts and could achieve a serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that manifests itself with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, exclusion measures are taken.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980 was refused.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that without any doubt this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This episode showed us that it made sense to apply the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: nucleic acid (TAN) tests that allow to recognize directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against it, on which instead the tests used until then were based.
The TANs allowed to reduce the window period, i.e. from the time the person contracted the disease to the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
That period could be reduced to less than a week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to identify them is thus greatly reduced.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood samples before someone is infected with the HIV virus.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmitted with a transfusion is detected.
I believe that today one can feel at ease in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of the Héma-Québec management.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
You have to be constantly vigilant,” continues Dr. Décary before stressing that in addition to having safe resources, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient resources.
“Needs increase as the population ages.
Being the most aggressive cancer care, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has consequences for the number of donors, which on average makes up only 3% of the inhabitants of Quebec acceptable as donors."
However, all healthy people who have reached the age of 18 and meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer themselves as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
“With this 3%, we are able to maintain an inventory capable of responding to the needs of hospitals.
Cases of shortage are very rare.
But we need to renew the members of this group of donors as they get older and can no longer make donations.
Now it is difficult to convince people to donate blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to become regular donors.
Nowadays, life is so hectic that it is difficult to find an hour to donate blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec distributes not only blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited with Héma-Québec, which runs the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, abundant blood rich in stem cells can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the entry into the bank of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to take more than a thousand each year.
You should start proposing them for transplants at the beginning of next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice of cord blood collection as very popular.
"Many mothers are disappointed that they can't access it," because Héma-Québec doesn't have the means to propose this complex and expensive program in all hospitals in Quebec.
Football - L'Impact in semifinal
Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-finals of the Serie A qualifiers, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during a second decisive game of the quarter-finals, at Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro, scored the decisive goal in the 90'.
After a first time without a goal from both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next goals for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to score Matt Jordan.
Recall that on the first round game, Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thundler filled a first 3-1 in the return match winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semifinals.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps on both Friday and Sunday, but more details will be confirmed on the day.
In short - Kovalev's decisive network
The Canadian and his aces are ready to start the season again.
The trio of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led the offensive phase of the game by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first match, scored a goal, made two passes, and collected a pass for victory, in the fourth of the Hab preparatory games.
The only network signed by Kovalev was decisive for the victory.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russian warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
“He tried to overtake in the first period,” noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a nice ovation."
Charest Point North
The Prime Minister does not rule out the start of elections before the end of the year.
After the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Quebec where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tries to get elected in today’s partial elections.
"Expanding the boundaries of our last great northern frontier": this is Jean Charest's long-term ambition, presented yesterday to Levis, through tools of strong visual impact, on the occasion of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a kind of "picture mill".
On three maxi screens, they were confused by the spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
It’s as big as an election campaign.
During the press conference, moreover, the prime minister refused to rule out the start of the autumn elections, although he noted that he was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the Prime Minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labor, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the prime minister's most recent speeches, the opening of the Northern Territory to the 49th parallel had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North would be "a jewel of immense potential", but did not comment on timing or investment quotas, nor did he explain what the precise priorities will be in the implementation of future projects.
At the same time, it has limited itself to pointing out what it considers to be a priority: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which has experienced several improvements as a result of the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
According to the list compiled by Charest, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
That "large territory twice the size of France" is here, is Quebec.
Not only is it here, but it is inherent in us,” he insisted, as if to urge a national founding myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: gold fever in Abitibi, national engineering, James Bay.
"It's up to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes a part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
“It’s a position traditionally held by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been in place for a long time, and when the opportunity presents itself, I will reiterate that position on behalf of the government,” he said.
After all, "considering climate change, we need to reevaluate the North," he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will be open throughout the year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.”
And the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of the PQ of Ungava), have already started the consultation of some thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier, in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important post, has started work.
The prime minister does not rule out a big meeting, not necessarily a summit, but a moment when “common visions will be provided.”
The development of the North would also be based on the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be “concerted, ordered and will respect the environment,” he promised.
Jean Charest described this "project" as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we know how to stand apart to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a large cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's arrival as party leader.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Centrale Beauharnois in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
“From Godbout, creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage that nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, creator of James Bay, our party has always known how to forge the future,” said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he used another reference, conservative this time, the program "Roads to the North" by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the project related to the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric dam, Charest specified that its commissioning would be scheduled for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel we will do it," he told his supporters, acknowledging the applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of starting a poll in the fall, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He stresses that he is certainly very committed, particularly in a federal council mission to China and in the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided the Liberal leader with a platform of nationalist resolutions, in particular of the "constitutional aspirations" that have passed smoothly like oil: the PLQ demands above all the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hoped that Quebec would appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that the latter would have a veto on the decisions taken in Quebec.
As far as the opposition is concerned, the outline of the Northern Plan has been met with skepticism.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, dusted off the North Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not have respected its application.
If he had done so, we would have made progress today," Marois said alongside Jean-Talon's candidate, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The ADQ said it supports the government's adoption of the Northern Plan.
"What we hope is that all this is not simply perceived as a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont's replacement, returning today from the holidays.
Letters - A Dishonored Country
It was Vic Toews, former Minister of "Justice" (irony of fate) of the Harper cabinet, who allowed himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a "shame" for Canada.
Dishonoring in this way a woman who has fought incessantly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the prime minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are at the beginning of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, not to have repatriated one of its citizens detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that takes no account of the fact that Omar Khadr was a mere teenager at the time of the alleged events.
The only government that, despite having signed the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves a child-soldier rotting in inhumane conditions.
The only one who trusts in a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We recall, for information, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Order of Canadian Lawyers, in particular, are calling for the return of Omar Khadraffin so that he can be subjected to a regular trial in Canada.
It is precisely this same government that turns a blind eye to torture: it cares little that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps forever, after so many years of rioting.
We do not yet realize it, but we are witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and "democracy", a word that Harper does not stop boasting and that sounds so senseless on his lips.
Here we come to the moment when there is no longer any morality: you can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen at the discretion of a head of government until today minority (to see what will happen after October 14...).
Numerous voters believe that a party that preaches Virtue, Respect for Law and Order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
Shame lies right here, Mr. Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, vice president director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter claims that the world's largest gold company has filed a six million defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house squabbled with the intention of initiating a "transparent public debate".
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a defamation complaint, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to bring to ruin anyone who dares to support a position contrary to his own.
Regardless of the outcome of the process, writers and the publisher of the Canada Black book will have to spend a substantial amount of money in order to organize their defense and fight, with decidedly unlearned weapons, against an army of lawyers funded by the practically bottomless pockets of the mining company.
Moreover, in these struggles to learn weapons, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual settlement that undermines the opposition as well as frightens anyone who dares to speak again on the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is first and foremost to the public that it should present its own view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada the debates are usually held with an exchange of views and not with a bang.
It would therefore be sufficient for the society to open its books, its documents, and establish a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers who could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to have much confidence in public opinion and misguides petitions and letters of support from the authors of Black Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can call for a "public debate" when his contempt for that same public is evident?
In the vice president’s world, it seems that this word indicates only the perfumedly paid lawyers and not the whole of Canadians; here’s a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even deniers have the right of speech.
What Barrack Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and publishers of Canada Black does so primarily because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This audience is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civil exchanges of opinion, and not in the perspective of what many perceive as a kind of jamming (researching the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Black an ultimatum urging them to suspend the partilization)
Beyond Garver’s surreal discourse, the Barrack Gold grievance constitutes a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in any democratic society.
It denies the right to cite authentic sources and to debate facts and interpretations, which are the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss uncomfortable topics to the richest companies in the world, woefully multiple grievances, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following scientific standards as the authors of Canada Black do.
You have the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are a part, has been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures of Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is at the expense of the university world, as is the public debate in Canada, and it is now time for governments to take measures to limit abusive grievances.
Operation - Salvation for Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
Yesterday, the Bush administration and the heads of Congress, representatives of the Republican and Democratic parties, finally reached an agreement on the largest saving-financial plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to put a brake on the financial crisis that has been brewing on Wall Street for months, still needs to be ratified by the two chambers of Congress.
It provides, in particular, for checks on its actual implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to guarantee the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of pawnshops for missing payments, as well as a right to inspect the salaries paid to the managers of the protected companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Republican Representative at the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday at the end of a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress towards an effective market agreement," Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said.
“Every decision has been made in such a way as to safeguard the economy and the American people from the crisis currently unfolding on Wall Street,” he said.
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, inestimable discomfort and turmoil would have spilled over into the daily lives of Americans," said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of a new failure on investors.
The agreed time limit corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
Uniting later in the negotiation, the two candidates for the US presidential elections proved rather favorable to the agreement, without, however, avoiding to express their dissatisfaction in advance with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama is credited with adding some provisions to the agreement, particularly the one that will allow homeowners to maintain their homes and the one related to the salaries paid to executives of state-funded businesses.
“When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on the American television screen.
Interviewed on another channel to see if he would vote in favor of the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, responded: “I’d like to analyze the details, but I hope so.”
“Based on what I’ve read, it’s something that we all need to digest and that will allow us to move forward.”
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back taxpayers’ money from American financial institutions’ dubious, risky and unsaleable assets.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the bursting of a housing bubble that first led to the collapse of risky mortgage loans (mutui), then extended to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAA) and led to the freezing of liquidity and the slump of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in charge who blew up the first draft of a deal last week.
It seems to have come out of that blind alley since the Democrats agreed that the “toxic” assets of some struggling companies would only be protected by the government, rather than bought.
In order to meet with everyone, Congress has added a provision that, if the government were to face losses in the next five years due to such a program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first sum of $250 billion, to which an additional $100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The $350 billion payment is expected to be ratified by a further Congressional vote.
In exchange for his help, Washington will get shares in the protected companies that will pay dividends in the event of a profit and that will be able to resell when the waters have calmed down.
As set out in the plan, the federal government will have the option of delaying bailout procedures for real estate loans and setting limits on the remuneration and start-up benefits paid to the executives of the companies involved.
As of today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the vote of the House of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be released.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the project, both in the republican and democratic ranks.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t hear you,” said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee.
“Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
Not to take advantage of taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress dubbed the “caucus of skeptics,” Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred eminent economics professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us to say: let’s ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and to carefully examine the path to be taken,” he said.
At the same time, in Europe, we were once again witnessing the test of the world nature of the crisis.
Following an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalisation of the Fortis banking group for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would forgo the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) for the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85,000 employees and is one of the twenty largest banks in Europe and the ten largest insurers.
"It is not money lost," Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
In return, influence and voting rights are collected in banking matters.
It’s certainly something that savers and families appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this period, at the other end of the Channel, the British government seems to be nationalizing another bank on the brink of financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take charge of all loans currently under way at Bradford and Bringley Bank, including more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it will buy the branches and customer accounts of the British bank.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a busy icon
The beauty with blue eyes was for a long time his ace in the sleeve, for others his weak point.
Did you get rid of the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the charming smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensibility, and evident talent would have driven him out of that circle of powerful consecrated to real sacred monsters.
What constancy!
Paul Newman, who passed away Friday at the age of 83 in his Connecticut ranch following lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the past few years.
Less monumental than Brando, to whom he looked and of whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more prudent in his game, certainly more fragile, but also he spoke of freedom and the development of dramatic convictions.
Mixed couples often give birth to magical children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian descent.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
A humble ego, the last mark of quality.
Because he recognized a whole country steeped in the safe made man, the warrior of the Pacific War, proud in combat, who at the beginning of the 50s studied dramatic art at Yale, he later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theater, television and early in the cinema.
The same civil rights activist was also the car driver who qualified second at the Mans 24 Hours in 1979, as well as the sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
They leave with him the shadowy areas of a reserved, discreet, committed, allergic star to the scandals of show-business, of which you will never be able to fully unravel the mystery.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend Paul Newman’s disappearance has been a heart-wrenching moment for moviegoers, as his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
Over half a century of American cinema in full transformation is re-proposed through its interpretations.
Butch Cassidy's charming cowboy (1969) and that boy unable to desire the hot wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Roof that Burns adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember him as the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not keep what was promised.
Many other Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Lass<0xC3><0xB9> someone loves me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That sympathetic villain in the excellent Stangata, Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiards player in Robert Rossen's 1961 film The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which earned him the only Oscar out of nine nominations in 1987.
That face through the years, it was his.
It's his again.
The epochs are passed through his path.
He is best known for the cult movie Slap Shot - George Roy Hill's Dry Shot (1977), as Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans found him in 1994 in Mr. Hula Hoop, of the Coen brothers.
The circle closed with a final role as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in My Father’s Era, in 2003.
Unlike the more legendary film degrees that soon left the profession, Newman will remain in theaters for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its splendour, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French cinematographer, called it, with a hint of irony, "a living challenge to underplaying", deeming his performance exaggerated.
The profession was not always a game for the handsome Paul Newman, to whom the roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalized to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, drunk or desperate, of which he expressed disgust and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, pudgy sensibility.
Jennifer's first time, in 1968 (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, drew a thin female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated the 1984 film Harry and Son to him.
Among the countless tributes rained yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (they had starred together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) stated with infinite sadness "His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the missing actor.
Beyond a career as a legend, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of the Hollywood drift, is thus extinguished.
We will have seen her face stand out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging her a choice of bad taste, although born as a gag.
The proceeds of those sales were, however, destined for his Foundation for Children in Trouble.
Newman, instead of dwelling on his myth, chose to commit himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that said "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there was a privilege.”
And it was just as much a privilege for us to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
Citizen model, then, and much more.
What has been produced in the invoice factory of Zuschlag & soci?
The hearing of the criminal case against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and associates will soon be held on 8 October.
The politician and his associates are accused of repeated commercial fraud committed within the framework of a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and of other crimes, including falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor’s Office, the money obtained from calls for tenders was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the performance of the activities through false invoices.
The state and municipal money, totaling 65 million florins, ended up partly in the coffers of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, as disclosed by the investigating authorities, they have withdrawn the money obtained from calls for tenders on the basis of invoices for non-existent transactions and the associations have never fulfilled their obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were false.
To do this, the invoice blocks were purchased at the J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros market, while the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which firms to issue invoices, it was established, among other things, during the trip between the hills above the Balaton where J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag had sent Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados.
According to the confession of the latter, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for consumption, on the model of these then the invoices were prepared to be forwarded to the calls for tender, among others, those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Much of this is the work of Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, who, according to our information, drew up the reports necessary to obtain the funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "travel studios" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and partners in 2003, the restaurant provided meals for a group of 90 people from the Biztos Pont Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let Association.
So many people, however, according to the restaurateur, would not all enter the room together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation, later referred to as Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt to Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért, was full of formal errors and content.
A guest house in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay there, however, the bill included 130 guests.
But the compilers of the fanciful invoices exaggerated when they reported Pigal Kft., also this one deals with catering, in whose accounting - according to the information issued to the judicial authorities - there were not even the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1>.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s administrator, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and shown the invoices, he immediately realized that these were false documents.
"On the stamp the name and the VAT match of our company were at the wrong place."
He added: apart from the formal reasons did not return even the fact that according to the invoice one hundred people were accommodated, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
Finally the bill was for catering and their restaurant is no longer in operation for a long time.
The regular invoice compilers did not bother to inform themselves that the Budapest travel agency of their choice, organizes only trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with payment in cash trips to Hungary, which did not agree with the practice of issuing invoices of the company.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, the invoice also included VAT, while the activity of travel to countries outside the European Union is exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was also wrong on the four documents issued by the Hotel Révf<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xB6>p Kft. in favor of the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company it is necessary to apply the VAT at 15% and not at 25% as indicated on the invoices, in addition, the employees of the hotel issued only invoices while the invoices were in writing.
In addition, the "issuers" have ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they have indicated how the activity carried out the transport of goods on the road, as it is known from the procedure of the Prosecutor's Office, activity that was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
In addition, due to formal defects - due to non-compliant invoice format, false stamp - it was found that invoices issued in favour of Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt to Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, of XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>lis Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let and Biztos Pont are false.
The same happened in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> Sports Field, whose representatives denied having issued the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters did not even pay attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let, precisely for this reason the trustee of the liquidation of the company, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They have issued invoices knowingly.
Another group of invoice issuers is made up of those who were aware of having to issue fictitious invoices.
The Esély Budapestért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k in favour of the Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt Foundation in Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért of almost 4 million florins.
Ludovic Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rfi, one of the defendants, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
Together with Zuschlag and partners also Biogate Kft currently in liquidation, which in 2003 provided invoices issued for a value of about 5 million florins to the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, the Atlasz Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let Association and the V<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>sfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let Association, a non-profit organization.
Not even money movement because the prepared invoices were then reversed, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
In the following group of companies issuing invoices belong those that are connectable with the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized at the address of the general director of the Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3> Kft, based in Budapest but not available there, which deals with the trade in fuel and motor vehicles.
The company issued various invoices in October, November and December 2005 relating to the sale of computer equipment, for a value of about 18 million florins.
According to the data of the investigation, the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 has purchased these invoices.
The general director of this company was a Romanian to whom between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would forward the documents concerning the company.
As far as we know, Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hopp<0xC3><0xA1> and Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt in Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny and the counter-value was taken from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov Romanian masons founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
In fact, none of the companies were operational, because according to the defendant they had not received work.
The companies were still useful to him because at the request of the co-defendant lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the founding documents of the companies, invoices were issued on behalf of the companies to the associations related to Zuschlag: the Atlasz and the Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3>.
On behalf of the companies Cash Investment, Delta Tri<0xC3><0xB3>, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued to the various entities 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million florins.
The prosecutor believes that Kubatov pocketed 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont call for tenders.
Y-Gener<0xC3><0xA1>ci<0xC3><0xB3> and Sz<0xC3><0xB6>vetség in Modern Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért in January 2006 presented a call for the public utility of the Socialist Party, T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins per head but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the ban.
To prevent this from happening, five fictitious invoices received by Works Team Kft were presented to the TMA.
These invoices were found during the search of the office of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei at the Ministry of Public Education.
At the hearing, some of the defendants, as they have already done in the procuratorate, will probably report on the progress of the production of invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the defendant number one, J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag, decided to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has repeatedly promised to talk about everything in an extensive way, he has not yet done so.
We have to see if it is in his interest, it could also happen that the socialists have made agreements with Zussi, who - in exchange for compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to make the scapegoat.
Zuschlag for now could also have been offended since his demands for easing his prison conditions, i.e. granting house arrests, have not been met so far.
While the perpetrators of non-compensable commercial crimes and causing much greater harm can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which he is not allowed to do.
The psychology of bidding in excess: why spend more money?
At auctions, buyers are likely to spend more, to overvalue the goods.
Neurologists and economists researchers at the University of New York have managed to discover the neuro-economic basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, men do not want to stay behind in a race such as the eBay auction, so they are available to pay even a higher price.
Research has sought to trace the nervous pattern of this "match" at the nervous system level through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lot, the other group of players participated in an auction while using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method they examined the active brain areas of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the auction game, where the substantial element is to bid more than the other, the striated body under the cerebral cortex intensively comes into operation when you lose to the game.
This area of the brain, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the price increase is explained by scanning the vehement reaction of the striatum.
To support their theory, the economists of the research group conducted a financial tracking survey.
In this investigation, three groups tendered against a partner under different conditions.
They reported to the control group how much the actual value of the product in question was and they made their bet.
To another group besides this they promised that in case of winning they will receive another prize of 15 dollars.
The third group would receive $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would lose the money in the event of a loss at the auction.
The difference between the two groups was that for one of them the win was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
Checking the neurologists' hypothesis, the members of the group that played "against loss" were willing to make higher stakes of the control group or "winning".
“These results are not deducible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, they have so far explained the phenomena that can be found at auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image helped to resolve the contradiction between the two theories, so we came up with a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor at the University of New York's School of Economics.
Hepatitis: when to go to the doctor?
Nearly half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while in Hungary chronic liver diseases are mentioned among the first causes of death.
In Hungary, the number of patients with hepatitis amounts to one hundred thousand, of which only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many patients do not know that they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of infectious liver diseases caused by several viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and jaundice, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other blood viruses and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal discharge, saliva).
For those who travel, it is useful to get vaccinated against virus A and B, there is no vaccine against C.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain, and nausea.
After yellow spots form on the skin and on the whites of the eyes, the stool becomes clear and dark urine, healing occurs within two to three weeks.
One million people die each year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receives a drug treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver cancers.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens subtly destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, it is very important to prevent and perform regular medical tests.
This disease is much more common than the average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts, and tattoos.
In the world today, the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease it is worth turning to the family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated by the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, first organized in 2004 around the world by patient associations.
The aim is to draw attention to viral chronic hepatitis, the causes of its development and early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith functions as a kind of painkiller that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more bearable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford have conducted an interesting experiment, examining how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, the Telegraph reported.
As part of the somewhat bizarre investigation, an electroshock was carried out on 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists, while all were observing a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
Based on the results, Catholic believers were able to reject much of the pain.
Thanks to the human brain’s exploratory technique, it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first in a series of research in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from the University take part in addition to academics.
The test was carried out exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electroshock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with Leonardo da Vinci's hermitage painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary originated a kind of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's picture was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and they considered it to be a calming effect.
The subjects of the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and during this time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive series, while observing either the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics reported that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel "safe", as if "someone took care" of them and "they calmed down and were pervaded by peace".
Looking at the religious-themed image they realized 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo’s work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the test, believes that such a result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but you need to find the right image.
“We need to look for an image towards which they feed very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the result of the research.
“The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality,” Wright added.
After the excellent results only the question remains whether the painting of a Madonna by Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber is presented to believers, what effect could it have on the control of pain?
Would the vision of a quality Virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On the tenth birthday, Google can claim to be both in people’s pockets and in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, what outpatients they attend and what interests them.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s directors, this is still not enough.
What concerns skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they do not really see the substance of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to collect as much personal data as possible from its users and this is necessary to meet the original goal of Google’s founders that was: “Let’s put all the information in the world into one system!”
According to the director of Google interviewed, the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, is still at the beginning of being able to manage all the information.
When asked what will happen in five years, Schmidt replied: he would like Google to know how to answer questions like “what do I do tomorrow?” or “what would be the right job for me?”, but the software doesn’t know how to answer seemingly simple questions because it doesn’t know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their searches on the Internet exactly the words searched are recorded, from which IP address are searched and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
With the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can, for example, store their browsing history, they can relate to what they have searched and clicked, these then in the long run will generate much better tailor-made results; on this same logic it is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our previously declared and registered preferences.
What happens if my data is used against me, if they look at what I do? - you ask concerned users of the data monopoly of Google.
In most cases, the Internet users’ counter-reactions are caused by the fear felt for the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not for the sense of guilt, for the fear of punishment, for the desire for freedom, or even for rebellion to power.
However, one fact is confirmed and that is that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in motivated cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of Internet users.
Perhaps the most striking example of this in recent times has been the coordinated action against pedophiles in Brazil, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Orkut community page maintained by Google.
Internet users concerned about personal rights instead sighed for relief in May when the company - in agreement with the electronic legal protection association EFF - successfully proved the truth in court against the FBI: even later you can not force Google with any point of the constitution to provide any information requested secretly by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully ripped off nearly 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search expressions obtained in reference to the confirmation of the child protection law passed years earlier, but still failed to get the search lists of individual users and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back two months.)
Google’s judgment is therefore rather contradictory: those who are afraid of providing their personal data to Google because they believe that this will affect their privacy and privacy by starting to use its services and rise up with the rebellion against the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users who have appeared in numerous countries see in them the future generation of large companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as the conqueror of the world because of Windows, although both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code is always kept up to date and the program package is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies precisely one of the most repeated keywords in recent years, web 2.0.
Web 2.0 speaks only of collaboration, of intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: to show ourselves.
A young average can create profiles in multiple community pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, can connect them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his musical tastes, all of these can insert them into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which his latest photo galleries appear automatically on Click.
Meanwhile, we read of numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning by the common round of friends, comes to know easily with whom she spent the night her perfidious boyfriend or a company can fire an employee because she wrote a sincere opinion on the summit is a business case:
Those who live an online life do so to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that hides behind the behavior of young people.
Those who want to hide something or just want to avoid the monopoly of Google can do so (starting, for example, with Scroogle using the Google search system but at the same time does not voluntarily leave traces).
There are not a few people who do not sign up for community pages to not be found, Google’s online applications, from word processing to image management and news gathering, can be replaced with alternative versions not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile yet.
Public opinion is not waiting so long in secret for the moment when Google will pull out the claws.
Currently, the company with its 156 billion dollars worth is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), advertising spaces AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, the services introduced in record time not only cause Microsoft great problems.
However, the critical observers next to all this find alarming points: the corporate leadership, for example, has completely rejected the protest of the employees after having doubled the right of the corporate asylum, has considered too expensive the repeated catering to the daily pleasure of the employees, but all this diminishes in the face of the fact that in 2006 the government of Google has abdicated.
A rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, one thing is for sure, however, that our foreseeable problems in the coming months and years we will move the world to one point: while some believe that the project of scanning and storing Google books and magazines will assume such proportions that the company will soon face problems with our health care system.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the story Scroogled by the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached alarmingly.
Two minors helped <0xC3><0x93>zd's double-murderer clear the tracks
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, who are suspected of having helped to clear the tracks of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod region’s police inquiry said on Tuesday.
The young people have admitted the crime to their accused, currently they are accused of favoritism.
The two minors, two girls according to the information of the MTI, defend themselves on foot.
The favor is punishable by up to 5 years in prison.
The suspect in the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in pre-trial detention on Sunday.
He is suspected of premeditated multi-murder committed for profit.
The investigation found that the 23-year-old had a large debt to a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay the debt, which is why last Wednesday he lured his creditor to a construction site in <0xC3><0x93>zd where he killed him and his 9-year-old daughter.
According to the information of the MTI the young man had prepared to commit the crime, a signal is the fact that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
The police are examining the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered 200 million euros, about 5 billion Czech crowns, for the purchase of 100% of the Prague Stock Exchange stock list.
Ludwig Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer advanced by the Poles despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are held by the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60% of its shares within a few months.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 states that the supply of Poles represents the highest figure so far advanced for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that among all those concerned the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not rule out that this could lead in the future to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion kroner.
Under the shareholders’ agreement, almost 90% of the shares would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Banca <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xA1> Spo<0xC5><0x99>itelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%.
The economic crisis from the point of view of European newspapers
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday on the international economic crisis already speak of "a second 11 September".
The global financial disaster happened thanks to the American president - accuses La Repubblica - who was not able to compact his own party behind a law that was quickly muddled, the purpose of which is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbour, as billionaire super financier Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to speak of a second 9/11.
Even a part of the Madrid press sees in Washington the scapegoat.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy on the brink.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush’s plan was not perfect but as a result of the congressional vote there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, just as the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to ignore the threat - says the Tages-Anzeiger of Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a bailout doll to boisterous financial institutions, and with taxpayers’ money they can save them from failure.
But if more and more banks collapse as in a domino effect then neither the financial means nor new improvised solutions will be enough.
In the long run, it is necessary for EU member states to overcome their national egoism and concentrate control on dismembered financial markets.
On Monday alone, weakened financial institutions have raised more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 billion, the Vienna-based Der Standard said, adding that the fears that European taxpayers, like Americans, will also have to put their hands on their portfolio to remedy the crisis, seem increasingly real.
The EU has so far not cared much about the crisis that has swept across the old continent like a tsunami.
The "saviors" do not have to blow up 100 billion euros immediately, however it would be better if they established in which case it is appropriate to touch the taxpayers' money to prevent greater damage.
Intelligent machine imitates the flight of the squid
What could be the best way to develop collision avoidance technologies if not mimicking the sensors of obstacles found in nature?
For example, bees.
In the surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the calibres gave Nissan engineers the initial strategic clue on how to build the next generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotic minicar equipped with bee properties, with the ultimate goal of creating a system capable of scanning all collisions.
Flying bees form their own personal oval space that really looks very much like our protective shield - explained at the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of the PR technology and research and development sector.
Important is the role of the bee's sight, capable of a view of 300 degrees in each direction.
Engineers have drawn on the telemetric laser idea to copy the function of the bee's sight.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two metres away within a 180-degree radius, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that instantly turns it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels of the necessary measure to avoid the accident.
This maneuver of avoidance, in a different way from the current system, takes place entirely instinctively.
“If it weren’t for the robot car, it wouldn’t be able to react quickly to avoid collisions,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the innermost and most damaging layer of the protective shield, within which collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place at a glance.
But unlike bees, the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of steering of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scan the other bees, the robot, as a possibility available, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lithium polymer batteries, lighter and with high energy density, which means that they last longer than lithium ions.
According to Andoh, it is important the instantaneousity of the intelligent reaction, not the processing of the data or even less the ability to store them.
This robot must process some inputs in a few seconds and react.
No need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so use only a memory of a few tens of Kb.
There is no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for the immediate avoidance of collisions that, according to Nissan, within 10 years can be installed on standard vehicles.
Additional application possibility can be represented by unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that avoiding the obstacles present on the road leads to destination.
They also found the baby’s name very expensive.
A written version of the $700 billion economic bailout law has been drafted for the purchase of disproportionate loans, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step, half of the amount is spent.
In the new agreements extended until midnight on Saturday according to East Coast time, congressional leaders decided on the $700 billion bailout plan after a debate that lasted for days, Reuters reported.
We have taken serious steps forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic president of the U.S. House of Representatives, who said she had only to put the deal on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the plan’s compromise.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, speaking about the outcome of the compromise, said the program will work and be effective, but there is still a lot to do. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street but about reversing the economic car.
The written version of the plan was made public before the Asian markets opened at 8 a.m. in Washington (Monday night 2 a.m. in Central Europe), but did not bring much stock market growth.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the bill called the Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 regarding the program, after which it will be up to the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi on Saturday night, then welcomed the news of the deal to the White House.
"We are pleased with the progress made tonight and appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program, however, differs from the Bush administration’s original proposal, which predicted that $700 billion would have been spent all on the purchase of securities with disproportionate credits behind them.
Now as the first step you can spend at most half of the sum of 700 billion dollars, 250 billion immediately after the vote on Monday of the Congress, with these the Ministry of the Treasury will buy securities with disproportionate credits behind, the fate of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide the president.
A special college will oversee the program that also includes the president of the Federal Reserve.
The spending of the other half of the $700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
According to the law, the Ministry of Treasury can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy loans, mortgages and securities with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" loans.
The purchase can be made through auctions and directly - have announced competent of the ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to take part in an insurance program where the Ministry of Treasury guarantees the means that give concern, for which the companies will pay an appropriate price to the likely damages.
Henrz Paulson said the law gives the necessary means for $700 billion to arrive for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, whether it is the purchase of the wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a large financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to get ready to introduce the newly signed law - he added.
The directors of the banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think instead that the government will limit their success, defined by the overseas slang simply as golden parachutes.
Limitations on payments will only occur in some cases, and the limits depend on how the Treasury will offer the aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys under an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the gold parachute, if they do not retire the defunct bank director.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate loans, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the money of the directors is not exaggerated.
In addition, existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the limitation is valid only for new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first case in American history of the entry into force of a legal limitation regarding the remuneration of general administrators - commented the measure the Democrat Barney Frank chairman of the commission responsible for financial services of the House of Representatives.
In addition, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the program, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also earn us if the economy, and along with it the bank saved, will recover.
The bill includes that over the next five years, the president must submit a proposal to Congress that sets out how to return expected losses from the financial sector to taxpayers.
Of course, from both sides there were those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what the American people have asked us to do, not to defend taxpayers’ dollars,” said California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio Mary Kaptur believes that the measures were taken by the same who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
The industry’s prices continue to rise
The prices of domestic industrial sales in August 2008 increased by 0.1% compared to the previous month, by 12.9% compared to August 2007 - reports the Hungarian Central Institute of Statistics.
The export sales prices of the industry reported in July 2008 were higher than 1.1%, compared to the previous year they decreased by 3.9%
As a result of the change in domestic and export prices, industrial production costs were higher by 0.7% compared to the previous month and by 3.2% compared to a year ago.
The prices of domestic industrial sales reported in the previous month increased by only 0.1%.
The prices of domestic sales in the processing sector also rose to a minimum of 0.1%, compared to July.
The highest price increase in August 2008 occurred in the leather and footwear sector (2.8%), mainly handbags and belts with 4.6% and shoe production with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high price level of plastics and chemicals has caused a significant monthly increase (1.6%) in the products and chemicals sector.
A decrease in prices occurred in the oil processing sector (1.4%), in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.9%) and to a minimum in wood processing (0.1%).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities have not changed.
In the other sectors of the manufacturing industry, prices increased by between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector, prices rose by 0.3% in August in domestic industrial sales, primarily due to the dominant effect of the increase in the price of gas carried out by the authorities since 1 July.
Compared to 12 months, considering the domestic sales of the sectors of the processing industry, the largest increases were in the field of processing of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacturing sector of products derived from metal processing, the price increase was 13.2%, of 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco representing a decisive weight.
There was a decrease in prices in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0.3%).
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the pace of price increases has ranged from 0.6% to 9.1%.
In total in the manufacturing industry last year prices rose by 10.2%.
Prices in the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sector rose by 18.7% year-on-year.
In domestic sales among the target groups of the sectors, the largest monthly price increase occurred in August in the sectors producing investment goods (0.7%).
In the sectors that produce consumer goods, prices have increased by 0.3%, in the energy sector and subsequent use, prices have not changed compared to those of the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month last year, the largest price increase was observed in the energy and downstream sectors (16.8%).
In the sectors producing consumer goods the increase was 6.8%, for investment goods a decrease of 1.4% was measured.
The prices of industrial export sales calculated in florins increased in August by 1.1% compared to the previous month, compared to 12 months they decreased by 3.9%.
Within a month, the Hungarian florin weakened against the euro by 1.7%, against the dollar by 7.1%, compared to August 2007 it strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and by 15.9% against the dollar.
Next year in the U.S. without a visa?
Kinga G<0xC3><0xB6>ncz sees the possibility that around January 12 the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement may enter into force - the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago with Hungarian representatives of the place.
In his opinion, "now everything depends on the fact that the overseas electronic system of entry and control is built in time".
However, he drew attention to the fact that in the new system there will no longer be an entry permit, however, before departure tourists will have to register.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy will continue negotiations in Washington from today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, who will be awarded the Medal of the Order of the Hungarian Republic with the Star and hold talks with the foreign policy advisers of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Presidents Barack Obama and John McCain are also in favor of the bank bailout.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the candidates for the presidency of the two major American parties, on Sunday guaranteed their support for the $700 billion government plan to save the banks, but there are politicians who are demanding the resignation of the Treasury Minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration after the marathon negotiations lasted for days, Sunday night announced that they had concluded a principle agreement on the plan to save the banks.
The Wall Street crisis and the financial bailout package of the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to prove themselves more suited than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls with the focus on economic issues, Obama has regained a bit of advantage, while McCain’s advantage, gained after the Republican convention with the appointment of Sarah Palin, has disappeared.
In a speech in Detroit, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion law.
He stressed that the proposal contains those consumer protection steps that were also supported by him.
"Now we have to act responsibly ... the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability," he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He has not let go of defining McCain’s economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain said, “We’re all going to send this situation down with difficulty ... but not doing anything is not a viable path.”
The Republican senator reported that the proposal includes the creation of a control committee of the Minister of Finance and the limitation of the good outings of top managers, things on which he insisted.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not have a meritorious role in the deals, but he was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi on Sunday reported that the House of Representatives is likely to vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press review of the German-speaking world
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole voters have become more self-aware - thus Der Spiegel analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the Internet edition of the left-wing German magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution devours his parents analyzes the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber couple took office.
The Christian-socialists have been re-modernizing Bavaria for decades and these modern citizens are moving away from them right now.
The epochal change is at the same time a problem of the whole of Christian democracy, and so is Angela Merker.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday ended a process that exactly ten years ago had been achievable: the unquestionable hegemony of a party-state ended.
Already 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU had fallen to 47.7%, for the first time below the 50% threshold since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005 still in the period of the so-called Stoiber.
The cause of this is the modernization carried out in a consequent way in the region, which devours the parents.
The sociologists predicted this 40 years ago, but they were very wrong about the time. However, secularization, the results of education, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the loyalty of voters to the CSU.
Modernisation goes hand in hand with increased possibilities and the political consequences are clear.
The pole of the right is intact, only within the pole voters have become more self-aware, critical, obstinate.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classical bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: the free professionals, craftsmen, graduates and graduates.
Here the support for the CSU has fallen below 40%.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative Viennese newspaper "Who with whom?" In the article "The presidents of the parties are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confused internal Austrian political situation created following the elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> intends to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits SP<0xC3><0x96> from intervening in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections have been held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast on public TV the leaders of the parties have just shown the cards.
Werner Faymann, president of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that cooperation between the two parties, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists, is possible.
Faymann has left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, as vice-chancellor.
As he stated, the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ssel-Molterer course was in any case rejected.
The repetition of this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, the collaboration will certainly not succeed if Faymann tries to meddle in <0xC3><0x96>VP’s internal affairs.
If his party chooses the opposition or joins the coalition it is still open in the party, the issues must be discussed in any case within the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider leader of the BZ<0xC3><0x96> reiterated that it is open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take on the responsibility of governing,” Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The vicious cycle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit for Equal Opportunities was launched today in Paris, organised this year by France, which holds the rotating presidency of the European Union.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, Fidesz Member of the European People's Party in the message addressed to the plenary as the main speaker of the congress, drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and, moreover, the most serious obstacle to their affirmation.
Mr Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r <0xC5><0xA0>pidla, opened the conference at the highest level.
Among those invited to the conference were governments, European social partners and representatives of the major European civil and rights organisations in the field of equal opportunities.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, according to the press office of the parliamentary group Fidesz PE, recalled, in addition to discrimination in hiring, that Roma are being extirpated from the labour market primarily because of their low schooling.
"Most young Roma do not have a middle-level degree and as a result of poor quality elementary education only a small number of them can achieve a higher degree."
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka also stressed, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in upholding human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the member states of the European Union.
In the view of the honourable Member, it is necessary to raise awareness of these links in the wider context between the Roma and non-Roma.
In fact, the sooner a Roma school starts, the more its chances of becoming a productive member of the labour market grow; through taxes paid for income and consumption they contribute to the national budget.
"The right of European citizenship of Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools," said L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
According to the MEP, the union of purpose and action of the European Union is necessary to speed up the processes of desegregation of schools and for this reason it is of fundamental importance that the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives are properly respected.
"The vicious cycle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be stopped, Roma children must be given the opportunities afforded by the democratic space so that they can contribute as full citizens of the future of Europe," J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka said.
As part of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to ensure for all, the aim of the European Equal Opportunities Summit organized every year since last year's Berlin meeting is to ensure a unique forum to promote anti-discrimination objectives and equal opportunities set at the state and European level.
CSU: mercy for a transitional period
At the end of October, the fate of the impassioned couple Huber-Beckstein will be decided.
Despite the bad electoral defeat, the heads of the Bavarian CSU have not yet fallen, so far the discussion of personal issues has been postponed.
Party president Erwin Huber and regional governor G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Beckstein still remain in place, the question is how long the mercy lasts.
Of the fate of the tandem that suffered a catastrophic loss of votes of 17% will decide the extraordinary congress of the party in the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have made it known in any case that they are not being attacked with all their might in the chair.
They have so tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that a day after the "Bavarese tsunami" claimed personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber then at the peak of his career, the Christian-Social Union got 60.7%, now instead after the coup against Stoiber have fallen to 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years has been "absolute monarch" in Bavaria which gives 18% of German GDP.
However, conservatives in the southern region are always of fundamental importance to the Hungarian economy, in the future they will be forced to coalition anyway.
As the first sign of reorganisation within the party, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered a possible heir to Huber, gets a place in the narrow exploratory group that will start negotiations with the FDP liberals and with the Free Voters exhibiting right-wing values for a possible coalition government in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate in the list of Free Voters enters the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as an opportunity of coup by the couple Huber-Beckstein and then treat without regard the woman with great ambitions.
The CSU leaders are now concentrating all their forces to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber, who has so far been plotting in the shadows, will also take an active role. The former regional governor and former president of the CSU has defined September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber issued some statements to the faithful towards the CSU, according to which they would deserve more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be chancellor after the Bundestag elections set for September 2009 unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, is re-established with joint forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment of the fiasco, the CSU’s loss of ground will not have a negative impact on the grand coalition in Berlin.
What is certainly relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, the crisis of the social democrats on the other hand still persists.
The SPD achieved its lowest result since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko opposition: 110-0
Not even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian Parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of well-being and stability assured in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), instead it is explained by the mistakes made in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people from a country of 10 million inhabitants has been devoid of opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday's elections the opposition assembled under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) hoped seriously that Lukashenko, with the presidential mandate renewed for the fourth time after the constitutional amendment in the 2006 elections, would "discuss" in some
The ODS has thus waived a previously assessed boycott.
Behind the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which has asked for a credit to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and has agreed to give the Russians the pipelines owned by Beltransgaz that cross the country, intended to improve the relationship with the EU where Lukashenka and other anti-politicians can enter.
It referred to a relaxation in the OSCE's assessment of the electoral campaign that the emphasis was on positive movements and not on shortcomings, such as the ban on running for a third of the opposition candidates.
However, the OSCE's quick report on Monday also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates in practice could not appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the vote count.
Despite this, according to the opposition, an improvement in the political climate is noticeable: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to a small confrontation with Moscow, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, although Russia, with which Belarus forms on the map a federal state, considers the two countries independent.
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun," Milinkevich told the newspaper.
According to the presidential candidate of the opposition in the 2006 elections, it is desirable that it remain despite the fact that "the power was afraid to admit even a single opponent into a weightless parliament".
The opposition does not foresee actions to protest the results, but rather tries to get the message of the need for economic reforms to the voters.
Obviously we have a lot of problems, we have to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, for the distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but also so I see that more and more people support the change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich referring to the fact that even the officially most helped class, that of the pensioners, considers his security to be adequate.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the increase in the economic deficit it is only a matter of time the disintegration of social security "reminiscent of the burial silence" - Milinkevich believes.
Contrary to the opposition politician, Russian observers found the elections democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on breakfast before work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were revolving doors for the entry and exit of employees.
But from today this new measure starts against the smarts, against those who timbre and then goes to drink a coffee at the bar during working hours.
The new anti-fannulloni was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The revolving doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presences and more services," says the minister.
"A new season of responsibility and transparency is now opening.
This is reformism,” says Brunetta.
With Palazzo Chigi, the installation is completed in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There was no resistance from the employees, says the Secretary General: "It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and croissants.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a nice cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister then announces that "in three months the absences due to illness of public employees have been reduced by 50%, that is, 60,000 more people to work in a year".
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more efficient.
Italian, "whose wage dynamics - the minister explains - in the last 8-10 years have been double compared to the private sector and well above the inflation rates".
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have joined forces to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by joining the appeal supported by the Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Functions today flagged numbers about the lowest absenteeism at work due to illness - writes the consumer association - the people of the 'working slobs' are constantly growing.
In fact, thousands in Italy are the correct and productive employees of the public administration who have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate rules contained in the decree.”
In particular, the Tar will contest the exclusion of additional economic treatments for diseases dependent on the cause of service; the extension of the time bands of availability of the sick worker, within which control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions intended by the Minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
In 2007, Inail data confirmed that there were about 1,200 white deaths.
Figures that testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the victims of accidents at work, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of Anmil, the National Association of Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expressed his "live appreciation for the constant associative commitment in favor of prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of the families of the victims and the awareness of the public opinion".
"Of course, an outraged 'enough' has arisen, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of public opinion, but the daily reality repeats dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly also a resource problem: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Of particular significance are the numerous initiatives promoted in the school environment for a more direct awareness by young people who look to the world of work.
It is necessary to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to delay in alarm about its social gravity, to apply and improve the legislative norms.
On the other hand, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined commitment aimed at putting an end to it urgently".
"The data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not take away that the number of white deaths is still impressive," said the president of Anmil Pietro Mercandelli.
We would not, in fact, want this "downward trend" to translate into less attention, because it is precisely when attention is relaxed that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at a general level too little is still done to counteract the phenomenon of injuries and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
In our opinion, we need more controls and inspections, but also stronger intervention on the training of workers, starting from the world of school."
"A further effort is needed - he added - with regard to communication and public awareness.
But above all, there needs to be a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensation protection provided for the victims of labor" and the "assistive drift towards which the system is pushing itself in recent years".
"The goal is therefore to return the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - because the fate of those who are injured should not depend on spontaneity or redundancy from time to time arranged by the legislator".
Mp3 players under accusation, put hearing at risk
Listening to high-volume music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
This is what the European Commission reports, which in a statement issued in Brussels cites the opinion of the EU's Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (CSRSERI), published today.
"From this scientific opinion, it emerges that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day while keeping the device high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability."
“I’m concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at high acoustic levels can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably,” says Meglena Kuneva.
"From scientific findings - continues the EU responsible - a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
Most importantly, we need to raise awareness among consumers and make this information public.
We also need to re-examine the existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and keep up with the new technology."
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the large use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise they caused.
"Scientists confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now, together with Member States and stakeholders, examine what measures could possibly be taken to better protect children and adolescents from noise exposure from portable musical instruments and related equipment."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but concerns are growing about the hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
You can greatly limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as reducing levels and duration of exposure to noise.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable music equipment if they listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours per week exceed the limits currently in force regarding the maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Germany gives way to the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the sums will be drawn.
This is the calendar set by the Capitol for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capital", which was established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will develop the guidelines for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the Junta and the City Council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official bulletin" of the Capitol and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are represented there - Alemanno points out - It will have to provide proposals for an idea for the development of Rome, which the political decision-makers, who remain the Junta and the Municipal Council, will then be able to use.
There is no superposition of roles but only the will to have a place where to elaborate a great project for Rome.
In March it will finish its work and then it will dissolve, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June - the mayor announces - we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Rome Capital".
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be there, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure also in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Too often, politics overwhelms itself on day-to-day management and on the emergencies that manifest themselves from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
In addition, the mayor of Rome wishes to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless body nor a carriage: it is absolutely free, it will not cost Roman citizens a euro and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligences expressed by the Capital".
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, not closed or immovable, to allow our city to make an authentic level jump, which it absolutely needs, thinking in a spirit unitary to its future".
A future that, the mayor of Rome states, "will not be limited to the current municipal borders only but will look far beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as a capital but "also in consideration of the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama? The first anti-American president. That's why
He wrote a well-known American politician who wants us to be independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decided the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks against Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
A Miami woman wrote on her website: “This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a big tough face: he believes he will win the highest office of a nation that has had two governors and five black senators in all.”
In fact, they are attacks that don’t say much; they are attacks that are clearly racial in nature and don’t answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And then there are the polls; they all say that Obama will win and with a good detachment.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, in the bowels of the southern United States, wrote an editorial: once in the voting booth we know well who will vote for the American patriot.
It comes out one side of the American mentality held covered to the last.
“You say what you want, then we’ll think about where to put the crossword, whether on Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before, that almost certainly seems the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1500 people: what were the mistakes made by Bush during his tenure? 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was sent home to kick in the butt.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack their bags.
Yet, Iraq for the majority was Bush’s weak point.
Whoever takes the place of George W. will have a huge task to carry out.
In the US, the economic backlash is also felt on journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. And many blame the Internet, the "murderer" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been questioned by the PEW Research Center on the state of their profession and mental control regarding the future.
Well, today journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, the newsmen did not openly state that they felt less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated as they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put the newspapers together, is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as the general public understands it to be substantially reduced.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that the national newspaper is following the wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It’s not hard for journalists to see where the web goes.
The major publishing houses open a gap to the Internet, for many seen as the "murderer" of printed paper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has increased to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it will “do something good” for their journalism.
The biggest gap today in American journalism is between those who run the newsrooms—that is, the directors—and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives nationwide are sure that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “work safety.”
Executives who plan to lose their job within 3 years are at 47% nationally.
For staff reporters, it goes to 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ed.) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the U.S., with 300 million residents and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and so it becomes a matter of “take it or leave it,” take it or leave it.
Directors almost always receive large salaries, while the editor can also earn $10,000 a month, in addition to the pension and payment of insurance.
For holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: tot days after the first year, tot after the third to arrive at 15 total days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their admission, often "sicken" during the year.
It's all about the weather.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNALE ROME, DANILO COPPOLA RESTA A GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the request of the real estate developer Danilo Coppola who had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a house in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the Unipol-Bnl counter-offensive investigation.
In the course of the process under his charge, last week, he obtained the release from the householders transformed into an obligation of residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate agent could travel from the provincial town to a home in the capital.
According to the court, however, these moves (to which the PM gave a contrary opinion) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
The Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 billion bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were, and are, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times confirmed yesterday that the current crisis is splitting the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, supportive of federal institutions and the business community, and its new conservative soul, hostile to the "Washington ones" and the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and Southern states.
The soul, by the way, which became prepotently alive with the vote that I said at the beginning.
But this is only an example of the changes, of the great changes, which the current economic earthquake may be predicting or already showing: not only in the United States but throughout the West and perhaps not even here.
In both the US and Europe, the crisis seems to be accelerating long-standing incubation phenomena that in the new climate are solidifying and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary re-launch, of the dual state-sovereignty category in relation to a kind of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking and financial institutions that have, yes, close ties with abroad, but that first of all see involved to a very large extent the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state.
This immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families who, among other things, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears worldwide economically but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be essentially out of the question or not to have much to say: the glaring proof is given by the European Union which, as usual, divides itself between different interests and between different state strategies, fails to decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each individual state that everyone expects interventions, rescue and relaunch plans, new rules, and above all the provision of funds: since when you get to the straits are only the states that possess the economic resources, the mass of financial resources can try to put things back in order.
And they also have the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of immeasurable value, in certain circumstances, of which probably no market and no international organization will ever be able to dispose to a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the state-national element is also in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had entered the realm of the net, of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to reckon increasingly with those very little material things.
All things that, looking a little, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth but are still absolutely linked to a confined space, to a territory.
So those who find themselves to be sovereign, certainly have many more cards than those who are not, those who have the misfortune of living in a place without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that predicts a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take over the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leaderships, especially economic ones, so inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And at the same time something even deeper and in a certain sense disturbing: a discredit, an insufferability, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in a growing number of Western countries.
That is to say, the belief that before their actions are the same ideas of the hitherto rising social elites, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall sense of the term, to have made their own time and to be increasingly alien to the opinions of the majority seems to be gaining ground.
The demand for leadership, in short, feeds underground a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the American ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in the sudden "electoral revolts" or in the sudden executions of the collective moods of recent and recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the rise of the conservatives in Austria-Bavaria.
One has the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rituals, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say someone, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not now taking shape in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is intensifying.
In the face of all this, talking about a “rebellion of the masses” on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
But keeping your eyes wide open certainly isn’t for nothing.
The superglue to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity with a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has gone very close to us.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimetres, the researchers were able to glue a 100-kilogram body onto a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scientists is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a stack of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geese, covered with microscopic hairs that manage to ensure a perfect adhesion to the animal.
Tests carried out on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "detachs easily from the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe so, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could relate to aerospace engineering.
There are no superheroes at the moment.
THE OTHER SEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also devoting itself to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, Californian scientists presented an adhesive formed from microfibers like hair that self-cleans itself from dust while moving on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juices
Pay attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in the summer because they are thirst-quenching and rich in vitamins, if taken at the same time as some life-saving drugs, alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness, depending on the case, with even serious consequences for health.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with the intake of some medicines, David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia is launching a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice and the risk of heartburn is reduced.
Grapefruit juice was already under indictment because it was believed responsible for increasing the effects of certain antiarrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological drugs to levels considered toxic.
PHARMACEUTICALS RISK - The same Italian drug agency had reported this in a newsletter two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger resulting from this mix and to pay attention to what you drink in case you take drugs such as Diazepam or Methadone.
NOT ONLY POMPELMO - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active substances inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the pharmacology department of the State University of Milan: "These findings are usually immediately reported to the various international and national drug agencies that may change the information notes of the drugs.
So always read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines you are taking and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not make us impress but ask the doctor or pharmacist for clarification,” said the expert to the agency Ansa.
The Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies of business models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a New Keynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a noted New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s foreign policy and economic choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days when Enron failed, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that sparked not a few controversies and that for years was refaced to the economist, but that now turned out to be accurate.
“I’m surprised and even a little shocked at how quickly the memory of scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from the public eye,” Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, of the European Central Bank’s executive committee, Krugman is a “high-value economist”, but also a whistleblower with a “very aggressive, particularly critical style against the Bush administration’s excesses of liberalism”.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It’s OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the best-known Microsoft Office.
After nearly a year of work by volunteer developers, who oversee SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with several new features: to the welcome screen and the revised and rendered interface less spartan, more substantial ones are added such as native compatibility for the standard Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new Format 1.
Attention also paid to interoperability with the 2007 Office suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some features specific to some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by e-mail, or the possibility to import PDF files into the graphic processing form, while retaining the original appearance of the page.
You can also create "hybrid PDF" documents on this front, which accumulate the typical Adobe format graphics with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene multiple hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the word processor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognition during revision.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to release the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English version that was on the mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual, the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent to your home or workplace.
And if the theme of gratuity can be a drag for diffusion in homes, it is precisely in business that the Open Office suite tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects realized in the public administration and in schools.
And there is no shortage of companies that offer an ideal training, advice and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the corresponding videowriting of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for the PowerPoint emulsifier presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on the databases; Draw, is finally the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that today we are at almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can also exceed the expected figure.
Kohl also tested positive as the fourth case of doping
New case of positivity at the last Tour de France: this is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third ranked and winner of the best climber jersey.
The news is reported on the website of the newspaper L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth positive rider at Cera, the third-generation EPO, after the Italians Riccardo Ricci<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
Kohl's blood samples were analyzed in recent weeks by the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analyses confirm Cera's positivity, the Austrian will lose third place on the Tour and face two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positivity to the third generation EPO is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had notified the Austrian authorities of his positivity.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed on the final podium behind the Spaniard Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the polka dot shirt of the best climber.
IMMIGRATES:NEW YORK TIMES IS ASKED,ITALY IS RAZIST?
Italy "as a country of immigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants" who are reluctantly welcomed.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has dedicated a long article to the debate on racism in Italy, starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the Nyt calls the "paradise of the north": the northern regions are at the same time those where there is "more integration and more work" but also the "highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support for the Northern League".
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
Also the new legislation wanted by the League that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
The Pope and the President of the Republic stressed the trend: "Giorgio Napolitano meeting Benedict XVI at the Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism".
Students victims of expensive-rents up to 900 euros for a room
The student housing market is not in crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the tenants’ union, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken on very serious characters to the point of excluding entire bands of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that the families of origin should bear - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so distorted the market to trigger a general process of increase".
In most cases, the rental offers then contain a series of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, without a limit of duty, sub-rents connected.
For Sunia, extraordinary measures are needed that, through the revision of the tax, can calm prices.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room you go from a minimum of 650 (Black Bande area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (Vittoria area).
In Florence a bed costs on average 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas close to the University, they need 250/280 euros for a bed in a double, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome in areas close to the central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) about 600 euros are requested for a single room, 450 for a bed in a double.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
You save only if you move to peripheral areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples for a bed you need 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed need 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the urban economy.
In cities where the phenomenon of renting to non-EU students is more frequent, such as in Perugia, there is finally another anomaly: the increase of about 25/30% of the canon requested from foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradise, the cities erase the historic rooms
The historical cinemas close in favor of Multiplex.
“A city without movie theaters is a blind city, it’s like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in large Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth on the periphery of large multisales and the consequent death by consumption of monosales in the central areas of cities, is one of those events that seem inescapable and incontrovertible to us but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear are often historical places and full of memory, "it is as if a friend, an acquaintance with whom we have always shared a piece of the road and many emotions, "says the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prix of the jury of Cannes, and that told the story of a movie for the audience.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of the performers, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed the doors of 316 cinemas of the traditional type, and to pay the highest price are the halls in the main cities: 10 less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 lost monosala cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the largest number of new multi-room cinemas: 195 additional screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, president of Anec, “it is useful to build new structures but it should guarantee the survival of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move into multiplexes.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund in favor of the beneficiaries: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
To support the sector they would need between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, worried about the closures, decided to run to the shelters with the signing of a protocol between the Municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote one-room cinemas both in the historic center and on the outskirts.
Among the rules, there are tax relief measures in favor of operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for the stop and in some parking lots.
"It is an initiative that I like," observes Giuseppe Tornatore" and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting other measures in place.
It is certain, however, that to counter the superpower of multiplexes, traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema in Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make "New Cinema Paradise", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the Rialto or Quirinale of Via Nazionale now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the blackened posters from the dust I turn to the other side.
Links between politics and 'ndrangheta arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to align the choices of the Municipality to the interests of the Piromalli thigh".
The accusations that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria turn to the mayor and the deputy mayor of Gioia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and to the mayor of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for external competition in mafia association are heavy.
Gioacchino Piromalli, the senior mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, the boss's namesake, already convicted of association for criminals of mafia form, sentenced to compensate 10 million euros.
"In defiance of any legal and moral norms, as well as common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed a willingness to pay advice to lawyer Piromalli.
"It would have been granted to the thigh - the judges write - to officially enter the municipalities facilitating the possibilities, already huge, of control and address of the public administration."
The president of the Calabrian regional junta Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organized ill-life there are many" in his region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are many local politicians who resist the pressures of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean.'
This morning’s arrests follow those of last July with which the police announced that they had beheaded the Piromalli thigh.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved but already in 1991, and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, had been elected head of a center-right coalition, after the May 2006 ballot.
He shouted at the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called in the case the then deputy minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having architected everything for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest order signed this morning, explain that the thigh Piromalli had even come to ask for the change of the A3 project.
From the environmental interceptions ordered against Dal Torrione, write the pm, has emerged "the willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur, representative of a larger group known to be close to the Piromalli, uniforming the choices of the public administration to the interests of the thigh".
When the energy is born from the waves, the big ones come down into the field.
It’s an extinct field, occupying more than 70 percent of the planet’s surface and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources they have set eyes on, and now they are trying to get their hands on, colossal like the Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, research intensified.
When the price of oil dropped, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmental conditions and the new increase in oil give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by offshore offshore offshore wind farms.
This amount would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would be more currents and tides.
Colossus on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years later to bet on marine energy are more and more and among these companies have always voted on traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies,” a company spokesman for the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
This is a good sign, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the United States continues to extract oil, and recently President Bush has launched a plan for new drilling.
In addition to Chevron, there are New York’s Verdant Power Inc. and New Jersey’s Ocean Power along the energy path that comes from the sea, and the sums invested so far, though not known in detail, indicate, according to observers, a rising interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts talk about a technology that is still in its infancy, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese one or some in Scotland are small in size and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
In order to produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of interconnected buoys.
The thrust of the waves, which causes the buoys to move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floats.
The pressure rotates a turbine that in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to shore through submarine cables.
For now there are four such plants under design, waiting only for federal approval and part of the energy could serve as a military installation.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and parking lot using six underwater turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of water when there are tides causes the blades of the turbines to spin, creating a rotational movement that feeds a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to take advantage of the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they tell the Institute for Research on Electricity, deserves at this time the potential of the tides.
Although it is an intermittent phenomenon, the tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely on the energy of the tides that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others overlooking the coast, have already invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and planned investments up to 35 million for 2009.
