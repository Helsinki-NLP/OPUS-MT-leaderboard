European inflation slid into food
Accelerated inflation, recorded in the euro area, is primarily due to the dizzying growth in the price of food products.
The price increase in November has been higher than expected in the 13 euro area countries, recording - after 2.6 percent in October - an annual inflation of 3.1 percent, the Luxembourg-based Union Statistics Office announced.
Official forecasts only gave a probability of 3 percent, Bloomberg reported.
The European Central Bank (ECB), unlike the U.S., British and Canadian issuing banks, did not cut core interest, on the pretext that the decline, along with rising commodity prices and the reduction of forced unemployment, would cause a spiral of inflation.
The ECB wants to keep the inflation rate below, but at least close to two percent.
According to one analyst, the ECB is in trap 22: "negotiate" on inflation so that later it does not have to intervene on this issue.
Inflation of 3.3 percent, recorded in Germany, broke the twelve-year record; while in Spain it increased from 3.6 to 4.1 percent.
Inflation soared in the euro area as a result of rampant food and energy prices.
Wheat forward quotations increased by 88 percent and soy quotations reached their highest level since 1973.
Similarly, much more was paid in 2007 for vegetable oil and dairy products.
The price of crude oil in the world market increased this year by 52 percent, reaching almost $100 a barrel last month.
According to the ECB, inflation in 2008 will jump from the current 2.1 percent to 2.5 percent, while by 2009 it will already decline to 1.9 percent.
According to analysts, annual inflation will remain around 3 percent over the next 3 or 4 months, however the average annual rate will be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to cut interest rates twice during 2008.
Gallup predicts a government crisis
After a long stagnation, by early December the support of the Young Democrats Alliance increased significantly, reaching its peak since 2002, while the Gallup had never experienced such a low level - 13 percent - in the case of the Socialists.
The difference in the case of secure party voters – due to the greater firmness of opposition voters – would mean more than two-thirds (71 percent) support versus one-fifth support for socialists (20 percent).
According to the survey, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrats would not even reach the limit necessary to have any parliamentary scand: their support within the entire population is two percent.
Among the confident voters there are one percent more supporters on both sides.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even compared to the previous lowest point - it has never been so high, 41 percent the proportion of those who judged the country's economic situation especially bad, while another 46 percent believe the situation is quite bad.
Families, after the most hopeful expectations of spring and summer, are now more pessimistic about changing their own economic situation.
As for the next year, the majority of the population has the deterioration of the situation and only a tenth expects an improvement.
In December, 71 percent of those polled, higher than any previous Gallup poll, estimated that the President-in-Office is performing poorly rather than well.
13 percent of the respondents trust or trust Ferenc Gyurcs<0xC3><0xA1>ny very much, while Viktor Orb<0xC3><0xA1>n has the support of 38 percent of the respondents.
54 percent of the population does not trust the head of government at all and 27 percent does not trust the president of the Young Democrats Alliance.
One of the indicators of the configuration of the political situation is that, what proportion of society thinks that it is possible to control the discontent experienced against the person of the Head of Government without a change of government.
While after the October riots last year, 35 percent estimated that it would be desirable to keep the government and the head of government in power, currently this proportion is only 20 percent, while the relative majority (33 percent) believes that the only solution is to hold new elections.
Interest in the referendum is characterized by the fact that 60 percent of respondents to the question about participation answered that they would surely participate and another 20 percent said they are likely to participate.
In comparison, in "a general election to be held this Sunday" would certainly participate only 55 percent of the population and another 15 percent believes their participation is likely. Based on the current intentions of the voters there is no doubt about the result of the popular consultation.
Seventy-four percent of the population would disapprove of paying tuition fees, 79 percent for the medical consultation service and 84 percent for hospital care.
If we look at these proportions only among the safe participants in the referendum, 81, 84 and 89 percent of voters would reject the introduction of tuition fees, payment for medical consultations and hospital care.
The most expensive is the Auchan, the Tesco has quintupled its prices
They maintained the average price level rise of 16 percent in the hypermarkets of the Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs gold trading triangle, with the difference that this year the VAT has not been increased.
Article by Napi Gazdas<0xC3><0xA1>g
This year also saw an average increase of 16 percent in the commercial gold triangle of Buda<0xC3><0xB6>rs the usual Christmas basket of the daily Napi, but in all hypermarkets there was a growth well above the thousand HUF.
As prices in food supermarkets had already “fired” in December of last year, so there was no drastic percentage increase compared to the high starting point.
However, it is obviously frightening for consumers that what they were able to buy last year at a price well below nine thousand HUF, today they can not do it for ten thousand.
The Napi basket in the hypermarkets studied exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF with a minimum of 91 HUF.
And the highest value basket was 10,573 HUF.
(In 2003 this basket cost 6800 HUF.)
The price of Unicum liquor and fish remained almost at the level of the previous year, but there was a sharp increase in turkey breast fillet, walnut and poppy seed.
The price of wheat flour and bread followed the data of the Central Bureau of Statistics, although in the Auchan we have also found one kilo of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
The competition did not reduce the price of the product to less than 200 HUF.
It was also surprising in this store that the price of Coca-Cola with a two-liter redistributable bottle cost less than 200 HUF, so this product, even with the price of the bottle, cost only 257 HUF.
However, in the basket of Napi Auchan was the most expensive, while Cora the cheapest.
According to our calculations, with respect to last year’s Christmas prices, Cora increased by 15 percent, while Tesco and Auchan increased by about 18 percent the prices listed in Napi’s basket.
Comparing last year’s most expensive basket values with this year’s cheapest basket values, the difference has been 12 percent, while growth between last year’s cheapest and this year’s most expensive basket has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
Last year the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so during last year’s Christmas prices felt the rise in VAT.
It was precisely this process that destroyed trade, supermarkets were visibly unable to decide on the margin of prices to be applied to each product and to calculate the effect of price change on consumption.
(If the trader misplans the speed of a product’s circulation, he may lose a significant profit in the margin that fits the sales volume.)
The increase in the price of the Napi basket reached such extremes as a result of the increase in VAT, which the most expensive was higher with 1720 HUF to the value recorded in 2006, while in the cheapest the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year there were no such extremes, since the highest price today has been 1630 HUF more than last year and the cheapest also increased by 1284 HUF.
Comparing the two Christmas seasons, there was a catastrophic growth in prices in less than 20 months, in hypermarkets the price of consumer goods grew by more than 30 percent.
(However, this does not necessarily confirm the figures of the Central Bureau of Statistics: this office, in the case of some staple foods, recorded a price increase of more than 30 percent over the 12-month period.
So for example, in addition to the wheat, also in the case of the egg.)
According to the basket of Napi, in the latter case this seems almost impossible, because in the price of this product that was quite expensive already last year compared to the base, there was, in the worst case, only a 10 percent increase in prices.
According to all the indices, flour suppliers have a stronger position than egg suppliers, being able to impose the drastic increase in prices even to multinationals.
Hypermarkets do not complain in the gold trading triangle, they constantly talk about positive results.
According to our experiences, most consumers of the three stores visited are no longer interested in prices.
Of all the products they buy large quantities, taking for pallets the canned food.
On Wednesday morning, the three stores formed large queues in front of the boxes because the number of customers suddenly increased.
However, we have information that inside the country the sales volumes are lower, numerous multinationals complain to the survey institutes because the income is below their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the case of household appliances.
Many Hospitals Save on Disinfectants
This year several thousand infections caused primarily by the improper application of antibiotics have been registered in hospitals.
The prevailing hygiene circumstances in hospitals, overcrowding of beds and overloading of staff do not favor infection control – says the doctor-head of department of the National Center of Epidemiology.
In many hospitals it is even saved with disinfectants.
Not long ago, an MRSA infection was diagnosed in the trauma department of the J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital.
In a man hospitalized after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of contagion occurred in this same hospital earlier this year.
An injured person in a serious car accident was discharged from the hospital and the same patient had to return to the hospital shortly after the MRSA infection and since then no major surgical intervention has been possible due to the presence of the bacterium in his body.
As of December 10 this year, 1,094 cases of hospital infection caused by multidrug-resistant agents have been registered in the National Nosocomialis Surveillance System, said Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, chief medical officer of the National Center for Epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals this number of infections produced by multidrug-resistant agents has been safely recorded, the rest of the information is not available.
About two-thirds of infections (683 cases) are due to MRSA, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus, resistant to methicillin-oxacillin.
One-third of humans carry Staphylococcus aureus (SA) bacteria in their nose without causing any disease.
Infections caused by SA (e.g., throat inflammation, tonsillitis, skin infections, wound infections) react well to antibiotics and are easily treated.
However, once antibiotics are over-applied or improperly applied, the bacteria that normally react well to antibiotics are transformed into bacteria that are highly resistant to antibiotics and quickly spread under inadequate hospital conditions.
They can cause serious hospital infections, such as wound infections or septicemia in the first place to patients with transient or chronic immunodeficiency, to patients with the weakened organism, to the elderly or to people of low weight.
In the opinion of the doctor-director of the J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Hospital there is nothing special in MRSA infection, these infections are daily in hospitals.
The infection should not be confused with the epidemic, MRSA is only absent - said Tibor Nyulasi - where its presence is not examined.
Resistant to antibiotics
“These patients are isolated, the nursing staff treats them in rubber gloves and mask and there are appropriate antibiotics for their treatment,” said Tibor Nyulasi.
Hospitalised patients are pre-examined to verify the presence of MRSA in their body, but even so infection cannot be avoided in all cases.
It is not fashionable to take samples
It would be possible to prevent MRSA hospital infections in most cases, however the current national hospital circumstances do not favor the prevention of training and infection with multidrug-resistant pathogens - says Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
Because this infection occurs primarily in hospitals and nursing homes, hospitals should screen hospitalized patients and immediately isolate patients who carry MRSA in their bodies.
However, in Hungarian hospitals it is not fashionable to take microbiological samples.
This is also due to the fact that the National Health Fund does not fund these medical examinations.
So most cases come to light when MRSA infections are already visible in the patient,” said the epidemiologic center’s chief medical officer.
The European Union makes strict recommendations for the application of antibiotics in human medicine and there are also national directives to treat infections and pathological conditions.
Efforts must be made to ensure that antibiotic therapy is targeted, i.e. microbiological tests should be done to prevent drug resistance, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Taking microbiological samples are even less frequent in the case of walking patients or in basic care - said Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz.
Save on Disinfectants
Scientific experiments have shown that in most cases MRSA is spread from one patient to another through health personnel.
Therefore, hand washing, the use of rubber gloves and masks play a very important role, however, also in this sense considerable shortcomings are experienced in hospitals.
MRSA is contagious through droplet transmission and direct contact between people, however in national hospital circumstances it is not always possible to isolate the infected patient.
Moreover, hospital rooms are often crowded, beds are often very close together, although to prevent the epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 meters.
Unfortunately you can also experience - added Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz - that in hospitals of less favorable economic situation is saved with disinfectants, there are few nurses and many patients and therefore there is a greater probability for infection.
In the opinion of Karolina B<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>cz, where the appropriate preventive measures are complied with, fewer infections of this type are recorded or the infection of the pathogen can be stopped.
Government programme against MRSA
The treatment of MRSA infection is a huge expense for the National Health Insurance Fund, so in all countries it is fought against.
In England, for example, there is a government program to prevent and reduce MRSA cases.
Apparently the program is successful, according to the data provided, MRSA infections show a decreasing trend in England.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has among its priorities the prevention of multidrug-resistant agents (among them MRSA) and that of hospital infections due to these pathogens.
Negative control of alcoholemia of the police commander who caused a fatal accident
The official expert report on the case of the fatal accident caused by the commander of the police of the XXII district has been made.
It is possible to exclude the possibility that the then-retired commander of the police of the XXII district, who on Tuesday hit and caused the death of a passerby, drove drunk or in a stunned state - reported Friday Attila Morvai, spokesman of the Attorney General's Office of the Capital, after having prepared the expert report on the case.
The expert report confirmed the result of the primary control of alcoholemia that had already found that the former police commander did not drink alcohol before getting behind the wheel.
The then head of the police station of the XXII district, on Tuesday with his private vehicle when bending to the Kossuth Lajos street of the XXII district, ran into a 55-year-old man, who intended to cross the street, but not in the area designated for pedestrians.
(This last fact, i.e. that the pedestrian did not use the zebra to cross the street, according to the traffic code regulations are not mitigating circumstances, the driver must always give way when bending.)
The passenger lost his life after being hospitalized.
As a result, the district police chief resigned and requested his retirement, according to the police statement, because he was very moved by the case.
The case is being investigated by the Budapest Prosecutor’s Office.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander from the beginning collaborated with the prosecutors in charge of the investigation.
<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million more for infrastructure
Hungarian Finance Minister J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres and European Investment Bank (EIB) Vice-President Marta Gajecka signed three credit-limit agreements worth a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400 million in Budapest on Friday to finance education, transport and environment infrastructure, as well as the energy sector.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) approved in 2006 a budget of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget transport and environmental protection projects, which will be carried out from the Cohesion Fund grant, of which the parties had previously signed a credit agreement worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million, the contract they have just signed refers to the use of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>200 million.
The <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million credit agreement is also intended to finance the budget for educational projects.
The EIB approved a total of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>300 million for this Hungarian objective, on the use of the remaining <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150 million the decision will be taken later, by extending the credit agreement.
The parties signed a contract for 50 million euros for innovations, which the budget will mainly use for the innovation and research project of the University of Debrecen.
During the talks they also covered the construction of the 4th Metro Line.
It was agreed that by the time Hungary completes the details of the Metro’s funding with the EU, they will again deal with the issue of whether or not to modify the original contract and how to do so.
According to J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres, this could happen earlier in the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB has financed a total of 113 projects in Hungary worth <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.4 billion.
The interest on the loans is in line with EURIBOR and the EIB offers a grace period of 8 years, without charging a fee for keeping the loan at the disposal of the debtor.
Bulgaria, the real estate paradise of the EU
It is admirable the development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of the whole of Europe is directed towards that Balkan country previously little mentioned.
What, where and who buys in the even cheaper EU market, will quickly become more expensive?
Analysis of the Bulgarian division of Re/Max.
The preferred target for real estate acquisitions in Eastern Europe is certainly Bulgaria, with its cheap apartments on the ski slopes and beach chalets.
The mountainous regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most preferred, while in the Albena beaches, the "Golden Coast", the "Sun Coast", the ancient Sozopol and Nesebar, but more and more people are looking for real estate also in the surroundings of Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max analysts in Bulgaria, sooner or later also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will awaken the interest of real estate developers and more and more people will buy real estate in the especially cheap area of Rus.
Likewise, the capital Sofia can be attractive, the commercial and office spaces promise a rapid recovery in investment.
Bulgaria is on the best path to becoming one of the most attractive golf paradises in Europe, so it can be a prominent destination also during the other two seasons, in addition to summer and winter.
Therefore, cautious investors are already making their purchases, for example in the surroundings of Bansko.
According to analysts, those who buy real estate in Bulgaria also strive to change their life and way of life.
Most of the customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and more and more from Romania.
Also present are the Maltese and Cypriot promoters and traditionally there are many Russian clients on the Black Sea beaches and in the ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified into three groups – says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to settle here buy new or renovated properties for a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or old houses in poor condition between 5 and 15 thousand euros, to renew them later.
They require good communication and access, in addition to them it is important the proximity of a large city, shops and usually a local doctor.
They constitute the second category of buyers of chalets (Bulgaria in December was included in the top 10 holiday destinations of the Germans).
The third group consists of real estate investors who make their purchases in the hope of benefiting in the medium or long term.
The price of capital real estate is constantly growing, as demand is increasing.
Although in the European Union Bulgaria has the lowest real estate prices, in the last five years these suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of real estate far exceeds the growth in wages.
Fodor and the Six Percent Hungarians
According to the Minister of Environment and Hydrology G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor, the expert-level meetings will end on Tuesday and on Wednesday after the official opening will continue the negotiations at the ministerial level on the international climate regime after 2012.
Experts and politicians from 192 countries around the world deliberate on the Bali Roadmap, which provides for post-emission reduction efforts, as set out in the Kyoto Protocol, in force until 2012.
There are currently lively discussions on the particularity between developing and industrialized countries.
The United States has already indicated that at the moment it does not want to negotiate precise figures, although it tends to agree that compared to the situation in 1990, by 2020 the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect will decrease by 25 to 40 percent.
Another major theme of the conference is whether industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are willing or unwilling to offer material and technological assistance to countries in need.
A further agreement was reached on the aid to be offered to developing countries.
The support fund, provided for in the Kyoto Protocol, will be led by a 16-member board of directors, probably within the UN Global Environment Facility (GEF) - writes the "Piac és Profit".
Six percent of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, Environment and Hydrology Minister G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor supports the EU's efforts to preserve its leading role in global climate protection and promote the signing of the new international agreement until 2009.
The minister said that the EU is committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020, compared to 1990 levels, regardless of whether or not the “post-2012 agreement” will be signed and is willing to commit to reducing even 30 percent if the other major developed regions of the world and developing countries are also willing to comply with their commitments.
G<0xC3><0xA1>bor Fodor noted that the countries signatory to the 1997 Kyoto Protocol committed to decrease by 5.2 percent, within which the then 15 EU member states committed to meet an 8 percent decrease.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce by 6 percent the emission of gases responsible for the greenhouse effect with respect to the period between 1985 and 87, which our country will meet - notes the press release of the Ministry of the Environment.
There is a lot at stake in Bali, since within two years we will have to sign the international agreement on long-term climate policy, because if not, it is certain that its entry into force would be postponed to after 2012. In this case, the reduction commitments, assumed in the Kyoto Protocol would not be immediately followed by a new international system of emission reduction, which was recently endorsed by the International Committee on Climate Change (IPCC).
With this, the reduction of emissions would suffer a delay and an increase of more than 2°C of the Earth's average temperature could not be prevented, a fact that according to scientists would have immeasurable and irreversible consequences.
The British army recruits on YouTube
British army units in a video distributor release footage of actions filmed in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First the British Air Force (RAD) took advantage of YouTube services: special units displaced in Afghanistan since March 2006 are uploading videos about their actions against the Taliban, the BBC reported.
These recordings made with mini cameras mounted on the helmets are controlled in Kandahar's general operations corps, then sent to London to be uploaded to the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
There are already 139 recordings from the soldiers of the air force that have been uploaded in this way to the Internet and their "channel" has already been seen by more than 75,000 people.
The British Ministry of Defence registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of "defence headquarters" and publishes videos of both actions perpetrated in Iraq and Afghanistan, while the Ministry of the Commonwealth Office and the multinational forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own YouTube channel.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally the air force had uploaded the videos for recruitment purposes, but in the opinion of the Ministry of Defence they also serve to present to the public the true purpose of the presence of the British army abroad.
This kind of propaganda costs practically nothing compared to conventional recruitment TV spots, defence expert Gordon Mackenzie told the BBC, but they inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for the military actions decided by the government.
The Americans made a video game.
The army is also concerned about the fact that, in addition to the recklessly edited and censored recordings, amateur videos also appear in the distributor, for example about the death of the soldiers: in the "official" propaganda films, a little hypocritical, the officers speak at most of losses, without however presenting the bloody part of the fighting.
In addition, from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan have been uploaded to the Internet and numerous videos recorded in real operations, but the British army is only lately taking advantage of this opportunity.
Americans use a slightly different form for recruitment with free downloadable shooter video games, called America's Army, in which in the midst of a more or less real situation the player can put himself directly in place of the soldiers.
Tombola and salt cake at the Christmas party of the ministries
Labour Minister M<0xC3><0xB3>nika Lamperth does not seem very sentimental: instead of the Christmas party, she will hold a working meeting for her colleagues who will be able to say goodbye to 2007 with salty cake and coffee.
There is a ministry that will celebrate their party with live music, in another they will create the Christmas atmosphere in the heart of public officials with a raffle and a toast.
Party, Christmas atmosphere, concerts and buffet - so you have fun power.
State offices are also preparing for Christmas.
The biggest Christmas party will be held in the Ministry of Defense, but not for Ministry workers.
On Christmas Day the children of fallen soldiers will receive gifts and for Christmas Missionaries are invited to the relatives of soldiers who currently perform missions abroad. A reception for the press will also be offered.
This portfolio will allocate 25 million for the festive atmosphere of the end of the year.
The National Development Agency (ANF) and the Ministry of Economy and Transport (MET) will hold a luxurious party with respect to the parties of the other portfolios
The MET party will be held in the Casa del Futuro, with a total budget of 4,320 000 HUF and the presence of approximately three hundred and fifty of the six hundred workers of the ministry is expected.
At the portfolio party there will be a Christmas atmosphere, artists will also perform and there will be raffle draw.
The Christmas of the ANF cost 4,700,000 HUF and was held on Wednesday in the building of the National Council of Administration of Justice (CNAJ) with musical concerts and dinner.
The rent of the room cost one million HUF, the rest of the budget was spent for the more than four hundred guests.
We have information that the workers of one of the departments of the ANF are also invited to another Christmas party that will be held by a competition management company called the Hungarian Center for the Economic Development of Community Funds.
For this purpose they rented the complete building of the Comedy Theatre.
The information has not been confirmed by CHDE SA, since we have not been able to communicate with the competent person.
You can attend without a suit
The building of the CNAJ not only hosted the party of the ANF, but also that of the Ministry of Justice and the Police, which instead of Christmas celebrated the dance of the day of Lucia on December 7.
The CNAJ of them did not charge anything for the use of their facilities.
Five hundred people took part in the dance.
The party began with the minister’s greeting words and after dinner there was live danceable music.
Answering the question of [origo] they reported: to attend the dance it was not mandatory to wear a suit or evening dress.
Health, work and local government portfolios are gearing up for modest celebrations.
The Ministry of Public Health will organize a program and a party for its workers in its own building with a budget of 400 000 HUF.
Instead, Labour Minister Monika Lamperth is not waiting for her colleagues for an official Christmas party, but for a year-end work meeting.
It has the participation of one hundred and eighty guests who - as reported by the press department - will take only coffee and salty cake, so the party will not cost more than 350 000 HUF.
The Minister for Local Government, Gordon Bajnai, will instead simply toast with his colleagues in the classroom of the Ministry for Local Government and Territorial Development.
The Ministry of Finance (MF) will hold a Christmas party in its own hall with the participation of 436 workers.
The Christmas party will have a budget of 2500 HUF per guest - from this budget will be paid the reception with buffet and a toast.
Since J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Veres is the minister, MF workers celebrate Christmas in the same way every year.
Instead, there will be no festive atmosphere, the official character will be given not only by the ministerial speech, but also by the time of the afternoon of its celebration.
The agriculture portfolio will offer a New Year reception on January 20, the Ministry will not celebrate Christmas.
The reception will be held at the Vajdahunyad Castle in the Municipal Park and according to the portfolio, there will be a budget of 1000 HUF per person for the hundred guests.
This - according to the press department - is going to be a very simple standing reception, to which only the specialized diplomats, accredited in Hungary, will be invited.
These receptions, which are held every year, begin with a brief greeting from the minister and conclude with a modest meal.
The Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Education and Culture will not celebrate any Christmas party - this is what the corresponding press departments communicated to [Origin].
In the press department of the environmental portfolio, they were unable to report on the budget for the Ministry's Christmas celebrations.
What is known is that for the party to be held at the Museum of Applied Arts more than four hundred people were invited.
The forces of the giant strike are coming together
The League Unions and the National Federation of Workers’ Commissions will constitute a strike commission on Friday to coordinate Monday’s strike that will last indefinitely.
On Saturday, a protest rally will be held, while on Monday - the day on which the final vote on the public health law will be held - the work stoppage will begin.
This action will surely cause great difficulties in transport, since rail traffic will be completely stopped and until 1 p.m. the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Company will also be on strike.
On Friday afternoon, the League Trade Unions will report on the details of their Monday strike that they will hold jointly with the National Federation of Workers' Commissions.
The strike commission of the LIGA and the National Union of Machinists will also be set up to coordinate Monday’s actions.
On Saturday, a protest rally will be held, while on Monday the participating unions will strike for an indefinite period of time, if no agreement is reached with the government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on the public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the strike started.
If the National Assembly disapproves of the public health law, the unions will immediately withdraw their call for strike action.
Instead, if the law is passed, the strike commissions will meet and decide on the future.
On the basis of the Monday agenda of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only public health law may be voted on in the very early hours of the night, or at best near midnight.
As a result of the strike that will start on Monday, there will have to be significant difficulties in transport: on the railways will stop working indefinitely, in the morning may stop a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the intercity bus transport of the Vol<0xC3><0xA1>n companies.
At the same time, in many parts of the country, half of the roads will be closed.
Numerous unions and civil organizations have joined the strike, their names are constantly updated on the League’s website.
Some unions announced their strike for an indefinite period of time, others for a definite period of time.
Until the afternoon of Thursday the State Railway and the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) could not reach an agreement even on the minimum services, although, as the Christmas holidays approached, more and more people were traveling on trains.
According to information received so far, from the beginning of the day until 1 p.m., the workers of the Budapest Public Transport Company will be on strike, the Budapest Airports from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m., will hold a four-hour strike by the LIGA Trade Unions of the Electrical Industry and of the Thermal Energy, the Trade Unions of the Educators to a.m.
The Hungarian Association of Physicians will take a national strike at alternative times and the Democratic Union of Health and Social Workers (SDTSSS), part of the Trade Union Cooperation Forum, will hold a two-hour warning strike.
The most important of the four demands made by the League is that the government withdraw its proposal on public health reform and submit a new conception to a social debate.
The second demand is that they gradually introduce the new form of pension calculation that will come into force next year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, that, in the case of early retirement, it is possible for deserving occupations to enter the system.
The fourth reason for the strike is that the Free Trade Union of Railway Workers (SLTF) which is part of the League Unions, do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economy and Transport on the railway sidelines and expect another different proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: In the country increases the risk for the Hungarian Guard
According to the Risk Analysis Division of the Political Capital, the activity of the Hungarian Guard, formed in August this year with the support of the Movement for a Better Hungary, has increased the political risk of Hungary and the region from several points of view.
In the company’s “risk warning” it is written: in relation to the activity of the Hungarian Guard the greatest political risk is the fact that “with the aggravation of ethnic tensions existing between the gypsy and non-gypsy population of Hungary, even in the short term there may be violent ethnic clashes”.
The main reason for this is that the political strategy of the Hungarian Guard is probably the provocation of an event of this nature - added the representative of the research institute.
They stated that all this is due to one of the main shortcomings of the protagonists of Hungarian political life: "the protagonists of public life gave the public debate of the gypsy problem to the representatives of radical and extremist political groups, who were able to base their political strategy on the existing discrepancies between gypsies and Hungarians."
This exacerbates the problem, makes normal dialogue impossible, strengthens extremists and increases the likelihood of violent conflicts erupting – they estimate.
In addition, according to the research institute, the activity of the National Guard, due to the great attention of the national and international media, "significantly deteriorated the image of Hungary abroad, especially as regards the stability and democratic development of the country."
They remind us that since the autumn of 2006 the reorganization of the radical and far-right groups in Hungary has received increasing publicity and impetus, and that since the summer of 2007 numerous organizations have been formed in the country that define themselves as "associations of national self-defense".
"The common feature of these groups is that they define themselves as civil organizations, while openly proclaiming the training of their members for defense - even armed - (civil defense, national defense, defense of public order), alluding to the ineptitudes of the police, of the army, that is, of the state" - they add.
They stated: all this is done in accordance with the method that tries to give a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the discontent of society with politics and with political parties.
For highlighting the civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid the legal problems of legal registration, but is at the same time also a political strategy.
According to the analysis, the activity of the Hungarian Guard is also a risk factor from the point of view of neighboring relations.
In recent months, numerous neighbouring states have referred to the Hungarian Guard as a potential danger, while ultra-nationalist political figures from certain neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Hungarian policy with the creation of the Hungarian Guard.
All this affects the political stability of the region," they added.
According to the research institute, the constitution of the Hungarian Guard is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so political risks have increased throughout the region.
They wrote that the Hungarian Guard works in a similar way to, for example, the Bulgarian National Guard, whose constitution was announced in August 2007 by the far-right Bulgarian National Union (UNB).
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard is due to the mass riots of the gypsies that occurred in one of the districts of Sofia (Krasna Poliana).
Taking advantage of this situation, UNB decided to constitute the guard, arguing that the goal of the organization is "national self-defense".
In his opinion, in the last 17 years there was "Gypsy terror" in Bulgaria, however, the state remained powerless and indifferent to the facts - recalls the Political Capital.
They added: this initiative has provoked a lively discussion in Bulgarian public opinion.
As it was written, it indicates the increased risk of ethnic clashes that certain gypsy organizations in Bulgaria have announced that in order to resist, they will constitute their own guard.
As the functioning of the Hungarian Guard has so far shown similarities with that of the Bulgarian National Guard, it cannot be excluded that the Gypsies of Hungary also react to the threat in a similar way, organizing their own self-defense - can be read in the warning about the risks of Political Capital.
Political Capital Research Director Attila Juh<0xC3><0xA1>sz, when asked by the news agency, said: “Risk analysis is one of the activities of the research institute.
As he said, every year they publish their risk analysis and when they experience something that can influence the change of risk, they inform the public, as happened in this case, by publishing their warning about the risks.
The party is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary the law precisely defines the days that are written with red numbers on the calendar and has already become a widespread practice that around the holidays - that next year will be less - the working days are reorganized.
Even in the EU or North America, parties are not unitary.
Hungarian laws make a difference between a national holiday, a state holiday and a public holiday.
The festive days are mainly related to religious festivals and historical ephemeris.
Let us also celebrate the New Year: both the last day of the old year and the first day of the new year is festive - the latter especially so that those who spent celebrating the old year can rest.
Throughout the year we have eleven parties written with red numbers on the calendar.
It is a national holiday on March 15 in memory of the 1848 revolution and October 23, commemorative day of the 1956 revolution.
On August 20 we celebrate the foundation of the State, on May 1 the Labor Day, on November 1 and 2, we remember our deceased family and friends.
In addition, in our country there are two-day feasts, Easter of Resurrection, Pentecost and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our state, national or religious holidays rarely coincide with a weekend, so it is often bridged when there is only one working day before or after the holiday.
In exchange for the weekends so extended, during the previous Saturdays you can not be absent from work or school.
It is the minister of labor who regulates in his specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly in exchange for the day directly preceding or after the feast.
This legal standard is mandatory for all employers and their employees, as well as for employees and public officials.
On the other hand, it is not mandatory for companies and service institutions that, due to their function, work uninterruptedly even during holidays.
This year the order of work can be altered only around the holidays of the end of the year: from December 24 practically life in the country is stopped, since according to the experiences, most people "bridge" during the days between Christmas and the end of the year or take their vacation during these days.
Next year several of our holidays will coincide with midday or weekends, so there will be fewer changes in working days than this year.
First, the agenda around the work party will be modified so that then, for four consecutive days, workers can rest.
Saturday, April 26 will be a working day, so that in return on Friday, May 2 will be a festive day.
The other change is related to the party of October 23: on Saturday, October 18, we will have to work instead of Friday, October 24.
On the other hand, next year during the end of the year holiday you can rest, since from December 24th you will not work anywhere, even if the last day of the year is a Wednesday.
Six Little Disturbs to Bite the Lives of Your Colleagues
Emails that we forget to send, sound messages that we never receive, innocent lies that pass us by without realizing it: they are all part of our everyday folklore at work.
You have to decide whether to adapt to the small annoyances or consciously avoid the confusing situations that can annoy others.
Advice.
Sorry, I forgot to tell you that you were picked up by the marketing department," says one of your colleagues.
That's why you didn't go on a date?
At best he feels it and tries to fix the matter, he may call the marketing department to tell them he forgot to deliver the message (this is the less common solution).
Most of the time the issue is resolved by apologizing.
Before proceeding to gloomy explanations, it is worth meditating on the things with which you can embitter the lives of your colleagues and consciously strive to avoid them.
Do you borrow something that is not yours?
There’s nothing more annoying than when you want to grab a document, an office handbook, or your phone and can’t find it.
Remember you put the stapler on the table yesterday, but it's gone by this morning?
Can you find your lost pen on the table of one of your colleagues?
Don’t take anything away from your colleagues without asking them, because they will rightly be angry with you for subtracting their things.
Do not pick up envelopes or post-it from the office because it may be unpleasant when you need them immediately and they are exhausted ahead of time.
Do you gossip about the privacy of your colleagues?
There is no good solution to stop rumors that are already running.
Who, what are you doing and with whom?
Where and why?
Do not pass on to everyone the information (conjectures) you have about the private life of your colleagues!
Don’t abuse your colleague’s trust when they share their most intimate secrets with you!
Bury in yourself what you have heard and do not gossip about your colleague in his absence, although others also know the things about him.
Are you unreasonably on sick leave?
When you call the office and say that you are sick and you have an unbearable headache, you feel bad or well, you feel that on that day you prefer to rest; think about what others should do your work, your impossible tasks, your work by term.
Don't bother your colleague!
If you already know in advance that the next day you will not go to the office or something may happen to you, so you must stay at home, communicate them, so that your colleagues or your boss do not have to face your absence the next day.
Tears, laughter, phone calls
Are you involved in your work, but are you suddenly drawn out of it by the laughter of your colleagues?
Have you involuntarily heard a phone conversation that would have been better not to hear it?
Don’t bother your colleagues with your taunts, chants, loud conversations (unless you do them over your head), pat them, constant blasphemies, expressing your discontent out loud.
All of these can be annoying, even if they are not deepening at this time in a project (writing, planning, organization).
Do you blame others for a mistake?
Don’t blame others if you didn’t finish something on time, forgot to send an important letter or message!
Don’t allude to the eventual chaos in the office, or the noise your colleagues make!
You must recognize if you have made a mistake that harms others and you must repair the fault!
Ask how you can fix your lack!
Do you feel too much at home in the office?
Jogging and shoes: very comfortable habit for the house, but not suitable for the office!
Do not wear a comfortable jogging even if your occupation allows it!
Do not be disorganized, respect your colleagues and yourself by wearing everyday clothes, elegant and beautiful when your occupation so requires!
You lose interest if you want to meet the expectations of the public
The car moves slowly in the usual morning traffic jam.
It sounds like a strange compass on the radio: a violin with electronic effects.
I raise the volume.
Change the rhythm of the music and to the previous tones the bass is added and then the voice of a female choir as a real jewel intervenes.
The channel mr2 plays the song Wings of Love by Zagar.
The national musical life did not harm us much with electronic pop quality.
But now this jam seems totally different when you’re listening to Zagar’s new album.
Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3]national [b3] are gradually changing the image and although garage-style rock is in fashion again, it breaks guitars, the national electro pop has shown: there are novelties under the Sun.
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger started his career in the city of Pécs, played in the Yonderboi ensemble until he started his independent career perhaps because both cannot be protagonists of the same ensemble.
With his project (Zagar) and his music, a mix of jazz, danceable electronic music and pop, he tried to succeed, when he was asked for cinematographic soundtracks (pl.
Ferenc T<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>k Szezon).
The wider public knew of the ensemble that initially acted only in small clubs when wan2 magazine selected their first album released in 2002 among the top fifty national albums, classifying Zagar, along with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend-former, able to sell also in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and his ensemble are fashionable, but no one has asked them whether or not they like to wear this label.
The set reacted as it should: it prepared a new and even better record.
The newly released album, titled Cannot Walk Fly Instead, will open new avenues for them, although the title itself aims to establish continuity with the initial years in the city of Pécs.
For this title was one of the lines of the ancient set of Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
The reference to the airy, about the flight, but in addition to the airy of the music, now appeared - according to the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds strongest, the effect of rock and roll.
With these songs he presented the album at the Millennium Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rgy Ligeti, the singer currently working in England with the ensemble The Puzzle.
The album includes a real success of the channel mr2 Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi that recently broadcasts popular music from morning to night. This broadcaster brought to the ears of radio listeners the high-flying music of Wings of Love, recorded with six Hungarian singers (Divas Underground").
Everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question arises: what are you playing, to what extent is a music dedicated to a select audience?
Bal<0xC3><0xA1>zs Zs<0xC3><0xA1>ger: The definition of select audience for me means little.
In my opinion there are two types of castes in light music; not mainstream and underground, not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
Also the so-called underground alternative music can be boring, meaningless and can be composed equally only for sale, which makes it commercial.
But a good pop song can also come from sincere inspiration.
The attitude of the listeners also works with this spirit, regardless of national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see any difference between the reception of your music by Hungarian and foreign audiences?
B. Zs: Abroad, especially to the west of us, light music has larger traditions.
There not only the generations of fifteen and twenty years old attend the concerts, but also the older ones.
They pay much more attention to the changes that occur around them in light music, because they consider it part of contemporary culture.
hvg.hu: What role does the public play in your work?
Do you care who they are, where they are from and how many people are listening to your music?
B.Zs: Of course I feel good seeing more and more people attending our concerts.
But we have never composed music for the market.
We do not compose music for some purpose, but for some reason.
The role of the audience is rather felt in concerts where there is a reciprocal influence, but this is only in the inconceivable changes of the moment.
And yet, I realized that if you want to meet the expectations of the public, you lose their interest.
hvg.hu: To what extent do you intend to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He works alone and made his career rather to the west of us.
B.Zs: We don’t follow his path, even though sometimes they try to compare our music to his.
We rather work as a team, trust each other’s musical presence and let it unfold.
At first it was inevitable that they would compare our work with Yonderboi’s music, as many of us started our career in his group and from there we took another path.
hvg.hu: In mr2's hit list Pet<0xC3><0xB5>fi Wings of Love is in first place.
Many people first heard the name of Zagar in connection with this song.
Did you consciously open with this style towards a wider layer?
Zs.B.: We did not intend to compose great hits and sell our album with these hits.
This song is more than that.
We added it to the end of the disc, trying to relax after the orgy of the disc and the heavier tracks.
hvg.hu: How did you select the six singers?
Why exactly to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was to create a gospel-style choir.
Then came the idea of creating this choir of good voice soloists from our own national music scene.
Thus was created that choir of six women - namely Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enik<0xC3><0xB5> Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh - who was then baptized as Underground Divas.
hvg.hu: Did you compose the song exactly like that or did the girls change some things?
Zs.B.: This song existed a long time ago in instrumental version and when we already had all the material on the record, we thought that something was still missing.
The accordion attracted the singing.
Even that night I recorded the song that the girls later learned.
It all came about at the first attempt and in an incredibly spontaneous way.
I remember, I was very excited at the time, but of course I needed the Divas too.
With my voice it wouldn’t have worked so hard.
hvg.hu: Both in the concert and on the record it seems as if the girls were in the background.
There are no soloists (except for Judy Jay’s short solo), they don’t have a role of their own, they all sing together and not more strongly than the music, so the music doesn’t just accompany their songs.
Also on stage they are located in the background.
Intentionally?
B.Zs: They are in the background simply because of technical problems.
Instead, we consciously did not want to distribute soloist roles.
The song is also about this, that we forget our ego for a while, that who has come from where and where he goes, then let those wings, the wings of love lift us up.
I would have wanted others to feel that euphoric mood that we felt when this song was born.
hvg.hu: What did you do the most work on?
Zs.B.: In the musical composition actually none, but when it came to mixing there were more difficult pieces.
For example the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm playing on a concert piano or the Rock'n'Roll Goes To The Girls, where for a long time I didn't want the groove to work and then, little by little, everything came into place like a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new album?
Zs.B.: This constantly changes with the concerts and because I have already "released" the album.
Now the Prophet Is A Fool, the Escape From The Earth and the Never The Same.
A treacherous stockbroker risks billions for his inferiority complex
He's a disloyal abuser.
This is how he points to his former employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French banking giant of Société Générale, also owner of the Czech Commercial Bank.
For him he lost about five billion euros.
However, it seems rather that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare himself to his colleagues and certainly with good abilities.
He long ago intuited, unlike all the big Czech banks, the crisis in the American mortgage market.
"He has a fragile character" was heard from his superiors, the same ones who sent him to the police.
But what emerges from Kerviel’s answers according to what the French media, such as the newspaper Le Monde, highlights is that he was a man who at the end of last year had a profit of more than 1.6 billion euros thanks to his business.
Crisis not only in America
“All I wanted to do was make money for my bank,” he said.
Precisely, in the summer, he managed to win during the American crisis, 500 million euros.
This opportunity already saw her coming at the beginning of the year.
In February, some news began to be heard about so-called sub-prime mortgages offered to low-income customers or those who in the past had problems with payments and that those customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not affect the entire economy.
Kerviel did not believe him and bet correctly.
And then, at the end of the year, their profits exceeded 1.6 billion euros.
“When I won my first $500 million, I didn’t know how to report it,” Kerviel says, adding that he hasn’t left anything for himself at all.
Throughout the interrogation he stated that he had falsified the records in such a way that they were not discovered.
He even fooled the bosses, even as the Eurex Exchange began to take an interest in his business.
Risk has become a benefit
Were you afraid it would be discovered?
Rather, no.
“I thought I had earned $1.6 billion for the bank and that from that simple fact, that would make them happy.”
Where did you get so much willpower to risk that way?
In my position I had to work gradually.
He joined Société Générale in 2000, exactly after finishing his studies in Lyon.
His annual salary was between $51,000.
Two years later he was already an assistant stockbroker and in 2005 he became a stockbroker with an annual salary of $90,000.
Still, I knew I would never win as much as the others.
“In my first interview in 2005, I already noticed that they looked at me cautiously.
Because of my training and also my professional and personal progress," Kerviel described to the researchers.
But shortly after my entry into the company came the first great success.
Thanks to Allianz’s actions, he won, during the bombings in London, playing down a 500 million euro title.
And this was a start-up mechanism, and he wanted more.
If you win, we'll let you
“This is like a snowball,” police said.
But it is said that the bosses knew all this or rather suspected it.
"As I made money, they closed their eyes."
Only, later, the coup came earlier this year.
In one day, he lost a billion dollars.
After the weekend in mid-January he wanted to erase all trace.
When he arrived at work on Monday, he was no longer working at the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5 billion due to his fault.
And how did they manage to locate him?
He became a suspect from his vacation.
“I chose only four days for the past year.
The runner who doesn’t have a vacation is a runner who doesn’t want anyone to take a look at his record,” Kerviel said.
The Czech Republic has the possibility to get 365 billion
The ministers of the government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programs of which the Czech Republic can get 14 billion euros (about 365 billion kroner).
This is almost half of the total amount that the Czech Republic can obtain from Brussels for the years 2007 to 2013.
Some 125 billion crowns will come out of seven operational programmes for the regions.
Czech companies will be able to obtain around 100 billion kroner from the Enterprise and Innovation Program.
Most of the money will go to transport, up to 150 billion.
The Transport Programme is the largest of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can obtain from the fund.
This money increases the budget of the state fund for transport infrastructure that next year will have the amount of 90.8 billion kroner.
The Enterprise and Innovation program should serve entrepreneurs and companies to obtain resources in business innovation.
Companies should obtain funding for the acquisition of new technologies, for industrial research and for the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
As far as the current use of EU funds is concerned, the Czech Republic is among the least-used new entrants.
Twenty-year sentence for former Nicaraguan president, court rules
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals on Thursday imposed a 20-year sentence on former president Arnaldo Alem<0xC3><0xA1>n, who was convicted in 2003 of embezzling $100 billion (almost $1.8 billion).
Despite this, a while later, he was released from prison to go on house arrest in his hacienda not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
It is not clear at this time, according to the AP agency, that the then head of the Central American state between 1197 and 2002, will be back in bars.
According to the President of the Court of Appeals, Ileana Pérez, it will rather depend on the prison officers if they let German finish his sentence at home or if they do it back to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated how German was constantly transferring government money to the account of a company in Panama.
This society was fictitious and the account belonged, in fact, to its closest relatives and supporters.
Part of this money ended up in the fund that German created to fund his campaign in the 2001 election.
This is how the budget was approved.
That's right.
The state budget was approved.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first one developed by this government and accepted by the majority of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
This year’s budget was already approved with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, because it was prepared by Minister Sobotka and <0xC4><0x8C>SSD could not be allowed not to accept it.
Apart from different debates before the vote on the vote of confidence in the government, this time, nothing dramatic happened.
The Parliamentary Assembly, in this traditional but the most influential view, quietly passed the new law.
It's a big paradox.
Every government begins and ends with every chapter and budget departure, whether you like it or not.
The budget is an important part of politics but it hides the power rivalry between the government and the opposition.
It is important for the media and therefore they pay special attention to it.
Political discussions are much more interesting than mere numbers.
The State Budgets of the last governments of the Social Democrats suffered from three defects that for this year of 2008 it is not possible to solve so easily:
The first of these is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenses of the presidents who are not only pensions but also social benefits that were already approved last year before the elections by the "silent" coalition of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and KS<0xC4><0x8C>M.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public funding, such as the municipal and community budget deficit.
Despite this, the biggest risk is not in the state budget deficit.
This is public and relatively under control.
The time bomb, however, is in the deficit of the municipal and community budget.
Many mayors in order to obtain other sources of investment, besides the money from taxes, fees and credits from the banks, often issued, without meaning, obligations with which they disproportionately indebted their municipalities.
In recent years, they have managed to pay off these debts through the massive sale of energy stocks and other development networks that they received from the state and from privatization.
They currently do not have this resource.
If we look only at the official and verified facts, we find that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, is going through growth phases in the same way as the rest of the world, of which <0xC4><0x8C>SSD boasts.
This was the ideal occasion for his government to put the state’s finances in order.
Instead, however, the state continued to be in debt.
The rest of the countries, with the exception of some like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have saved much more reasonably than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We belong to the nations that within the global measures we are less threatened by poverty.
That is why there is no need for massive social programmes which, unfortunately, in recent years have been unnecessarily inflated with gigantic measures.
And although they managed to eliminate some of the incomprehensible populist spending approved this year before the elections, if soon the retirement age and pension reform does not change then it will be the end of any policy in this country and, whoever governs it will be just a bureaucracy.
Exaggerating a little, we can say that the politicians who govern will be transformed into officials, mechanical dispensers of most of the tax money for retirement and social benefits.
So this year’s budget can’t be revolutionary, but it can stop the pressure of normal spending on presidents’ spending.
The planned deficit of more than 70 billion by 2008 would have been absolutely unnecessary if the past government had not wasted what they could in the last ten years.
We would not want the politicians who govern to become just officials so we must be patient and concede to this weak coalition of government, which realizes that the state can only spend what it is able to get from taxes and rates, tranquility for the preparation of other reforms of the laws.
Only this will enable the gradual achievement of a balanced State Budget.

Banks want to solve the crisis
The US Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British, Swiss and Canadian Central Banks decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
More than one hundred billion dollars will be received in the money market through tenders.
In these tenders, banks auction the interest rates at which they are able to lend money.
For example, the U.S. Fed will send out to bid for $40 billion, and then another $24 billion will be facilitated by the central banks of Europe and Switzerland.
After the September 11 attacks, it is the first time that central banks from different states have agreed on this coordinated process to protect and mitigate the consequences of the financial crisis.
“This step should solve the biggest economic problem, i.e. the continued growth of the shortage of free capital that banks could lend,” Bernard Baumohl of the consulting firm Economic Outlook Group wrote in his report for clients.
“This coordinated action by the central banks likely reduced the U.S. recession from 65 percent to 50 percent,” Baumohl added in his report.
Banks have already spent $60 billion on unpaid loans, especially in the United States.
Economists still expect billions in losses.
“Central banks must really be afraid of what awaits them when they decide to take this step,” said ABN Amro chief economist Kieran Davies.
"It seems that the situation is really bad," he added.
Central banks fear that they will have the same problems of access to loans and that they will therefore have to lend more expensively to their customers.
This would reduce consumption and send the U.S. economy into recession with different impacts on global economic growth.
The central banks thus decided, after failing to reduce the so-called LIBOR rate, the London interbank rate used for money lending in the interbank market.
This means that the banks were constantly afraid to lend money even when the US Central Banks, Canada and Britain lowered their interest rates several times during the fall.
"It will have the same effect as another interest rate drop," Greg Salvaggio of Tempus Consulting told Reuters.
Some economists are not surprised that the step taken by central banks helps to ignite the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the United States.
Klaus: The debates of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change mainly affects developing countries.
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus spoke again on the issue of global warming.
The criticism now arose with the closure of the UN international conference on climate change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Blue, not Green Planet, he commented that the debates of ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus, it is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a strange mix of government representatives and non-governmental organizations but the fundamental difference between the rhetoric used and reality.
“There the debates are barely structured, they are fireworks of words, substitutes for the solution to the current problems,” Klaus said.
The Czech president during the presentation of his book stressed that this issue is very important to him and that is why he is interested.
He also expressed his joy at discovering his book translated into German because, as he said, "many times I only find the caricature of my ideas."
Interested parties can now find out about their varied opinions.
Klaus recalled that he is not a climatologist but that he has, in his opinion, enough assumptions to write a book like this.
He is an academic, able to follow and judge a specialized dissertation, has experience with statistics and is also an economist.
At the main moment of the closure he expressed his thought that the climate is constantly changing and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement between scientists on the warming of the planet, that the consequences of the current changes are not so great and serious, nor represent possible disasters, and that attempts to influence the development of the climate are useless, ineffective and costly.
Furthermore, as a man experienced with totalitarianisms, he considers it unacceptable to impose unproven opinions on others, which he feels is a dangerous way to limit the freedom of others.
To the questions of those present he repeatedly explained that he is not against "reasonable defenders of the environment but against environmental activists who do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
Klaus spoke about the same subject in Vienna two months ago at the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people failed to change their driver's license
Six hundred thousand drivers were passed the date and therefore they did not manage to change their old driver's license, whose validity ends at the end of the year.
Today is the last day when people can request the change so that officials have time until the end of the year to issue the new card.
However, the Ministry is not afraid that after the New Year hundreds of thousands of drivers will find themselves on the roads without a valid card.
According to traffic, the carnet has not been changed mainly by those who do not even want to drive anymore.
While in the villages they announce a rapid decline in the change of cards, the offices of the metropolis are full of requests and interest in the new card has increased.
The City Council estimates around 2,000 customers per day.
In the queues wait half an hour.
In Prague, around 140,000 drivers have not yet been issued the new licence.
The issuance of a new card lasts twenty days.
However, it is possible to request the issue of the card within a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the driver must pay five hundred crowns.
Drivers who must change their license and do not reach the end of the year, but will leave the roads without the valid license will risk a fine from January.
The offender will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can fix the violation with a warning.
In the event of an administrative violation, the fine will amount to 2,500 kroner.
According to the above information, the person who does not go anywhere could receive a fine.
They could presumably pay up to 30,000 kroner.
The Ministry appealed to the offices to enter moderate fines of a thousand crowns, a maximum.
According to the voice of the transport ministry, Karel Hanzelka, the fines of a thousand crowns do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the driving license is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that every person must have valid.
People who don’t want to drive should hand in their driver’s license.
Just bring it or send it by certified mail to the municipal offices.
At the end of the year, the cards issued during the years 1964 and 1993 cease to be valid.
However, drivers will have to gradually change the other types of driver's license.
People with the document between 1994 and 2000 have up to three years to change it.
The validity of the card that was issued between the years 2001 and 2004 ends in December 2013.
According to Hanzelka, this is about 2.6 million more documents.
The court reduced the sentence to Berdych's accomplice detectives
Former police officers Josef Opava and Petr Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k accused of complicity with the criminal David Berdych will spend between thirteen and ten years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague ruled that the reduction of sentences, the first to one year, and the second to two years, would be final.
The detectives of the Prague department against organized crime were initially going to be between 14 and 12 years old.
The decision of today can no longer be appealed, only by revocation by the High Court.
Berdych is also charged in this case, but the verdict of the Court of First Instance awaits him in the first place.
Despite this, in other cases he has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
He can't get any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the involvement in the robbery of 19 people and the High Court today revoked 16 of them.
Most of the defendants’ accusations were rejected by the investigation because they were fabricated cases.
According to the Central Bohemian Senate, police members in agreement with Berdych passed information from police sources to criminals, covered up the thefts, and helped criminal group members avoid punishment.
These criminals handed over 30 percent of their loot to Opava and Ko<0xC5><0x88>a<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k.
The indictment refers to the criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
As far as theft is concerned, their victims suffered serious impacts on their health but are also accused of abuse of power as public agents and without a gun permit.
In the home registry, police found pistols, steel-core ammunition, a laser driver, and a machine gun.
The group of criminals, according to the indictment, stole tens of millions of crowns from them.
With the exception of almost twenty men in this process, the court has already convicted Berdych and other defendants.
Other men related to the Berdych case are still declaring other lawsuits, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> P<0xC5><0xAF>t and Maro<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0xA0>ulej, who have so far avoided the trial, are in prison in Ireland where they are waiting for the final decision on their surrender to the authorities of the Czech Republic.
One account to change a few children: 12 million
For changing some children in the maternity home the lawyer of the affected families, Igor Veleba, wants from the hospital of T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> 12 million crowns of compensation plus the costs of the trial.
For each of the mothers, three million, for the parents, two million, and for the children, one million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each parent.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l, disagrees in principle with Veleba’s proposal.
"We did not approve such a demand, it is too high," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said after today's meeting.
"In order for us to get an idea of this counter-proposal, we need the report of the specialist that the counterparty ordered to investigate.
We'll find out if it has a rescisor value.
We remain in the opinion that there will be hundreds of thousands for all," Dost<0xC3><0xA1>l said.
The amount should move between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each parent.
At the beginning of the cause, Jablo<0xC5><0x88>'s family wanted, for each month they did not raise their biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba served as the basis for negotiating compensation for the specialist's report, only that it was prepared at the hospital of the Motol faculty in Prague.
The parents of the girls according to specialists in psychology and psychiatry suffered from psychological impact and stress of different levels and depth.
The stress situation was better borne by the men although they fought with recriminations for the change of the girls.
Women take it worse with the trauma they are currently experiencing and with respect to what is happening today, Veleba said.
Veronica and Nicola were replaced by the nurses at the maternity home in T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> last year, on December 9.
Last week, the girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xBD> and Pribyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Bro<0xC5><0xBE> and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo<0xC5><0x88>.
The governor of Vyso<0xC4><0x8D>ina, Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Vystr<0xC4><0x8D>il, handed over 100,000 crowns to each family at the end of October as compensation for the error committed at the T<0xC5><0x99>ebi<0xC4><0x8D> hospital that the region administers.
All hospitals in the Czech Republic are insured by law as liability for damages.
In case of errors they must withdraw from the reserve fund and extraordinarily can ask for help from the administrator.
The court to date has recognized them a proportionately low compensation, the sums that were calculated according to the tables that count in hundreds of thousands and extraordinarily one million crowns.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the kingdom of Wallachia
Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka lost the lawsuit on the brand Kingdom of Wallachia.
According to the judge of the provincial court of Ostrava he was the first to use the brand Kingdom of Wallachia but the project was created for many years by Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> with whom the actor collaborated.
Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka did not appear at the oral hearing today.
According to your lawyer, the case is probably not over and your client will appeal.
"The lawsuit is that Mr. Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team are parasites of Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's popularity," Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka's lawyer said after the trial.
For him, before the words Kingdom of Wallachia, everyone has the image of the actor and comedian.
Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> has the same idea.
“We’ve had about 10 years of work behind us.
Search for money and invention of activities," he said.
For him, the cause of the lawsuit is money.
“After years, I’ve realized that the project is successful and that it could also receive something.
They want to live as parasites of our work,” he added.
A profitable business
According to the court, the brand Kingdom of Wallachia was first used by Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka in his television program.
In 1993 he was crowned by the actor Radoslav Brzobohat<0xC3><0xBD>.
Then it was not a question of orienting him towards the creation of a fictitious kingdom.
A few years later, Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> came up with the idea of editing the passport of the Kingdom of Wallachia.
From that comic origin resulted a business and a lucrative business activity from which Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> later created the company Kingdom of Wallachia.
In 1997, Polivka agreed to the use of his name and signature on passports and even offered his owners discounts to farm visitors and visitors to his shows.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge also ruled today that Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> only used a simple idea that Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka made public on stage for his own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Wallachia," the judge said.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project is Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his team who devoted themselves entirely to it.
The collaboration, between the now decomposing parts, continued until the year 2000 when Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> organized for Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka the official coronation in Vset<0xC3><0xAD>n.
From that moment, conflicts began between Polivka and Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, culminating in the overthrow of "King Boleslav I, the one elected forever".
The main role in the kingdom, through Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>, was derived from the singer Jarmila <0xC5><0xA0>ul<0xC3><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, as queen mother.
In 2002, Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka filed an indictment against Harabi<0xC5><0xA1> and his society, which to this day has been rejected by the court.
Something clear could bring in the litigation, the tournament for the throne with its princesses, which is already preparing Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
The new king should come out of it.
He did not want to reveal any more data or dates.
“We are in no hurry.
It would have to be something like the king’s road to Moravia.
The king would have to be elected on a specific date.
Even Mr. Pol<0xC3><0xAD>vka can present himself," added Harabi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VTi: prejudices overcome
I’ve never really liked the Peugeot 206.
Its running characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the gearbox, maneuverability and also the product could be characterized as below average.
But now there is on the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this one is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and to me, I just have to think about it better.
When I tried the classic Peugeot 207 five-door, I complained, for example, about the headroom in the rear seat.
But this would be the only complaint because the body of the Combi means in this sense, that I will not suffer at the two meters length.
Flying around the world
I go through the interior quickly so as not to repeat it too much.
It is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here I would appreciate more the invention of design although already the car looks quite elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there are times when we complained about short seats and backs.
Also unlike the model 206, the lateral direction has improved considerably.
And space?, and here you can feel how the body measurements have grown.
In the Combi, the aforementioned shortage of space in the headboard disappears.
Suitcases in the trunk
But the main thing in this vehicle is your trunk.
This should be valued as very accessible (thanks to the folding rear door) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with rubber straps that are an ideal solution.
They do not disturb, and can extend to the point of holding heavy objects.
But let's stay in the warehouse.
According to the tables, in basic mode it has a capacity of 428 liters which compared to the competition is rather an average value.
But not compared to the best-selling vehicle of the same type in the Czech Republic, the <0xC5><0xA0>koda Fabia Combi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav model, we find out that the Peugeot is lagging behind with its perceptible 52 liters.
On holiday abroad or when placing the stroller of the child its value is critical.
But if I had to comment on something positive then I must quote the floor that is quite flat after knocking down the backs of the second line.
120 horses in four gears
Our tested car was equipped with a four-valve injection ignition over a capacity of 1.6 l. and a force of 88 kW.
And to tell you the truth, this is what a 1600 should look like to despise the familiar five doors.
It is silent, consumes little and above all, has momentum.
If I compare it to the time of the skoda back then that looked like the exhaust pipe was plugged by a rag, I can say that with this one I can be impressed.
The prices respond
The price of the car is not for all pockets.
We must, however, keep in mind that we have tested an elegantly equipped vehicle with a very good engine.
The basic price of the car with injection ignition of 1400 for 329,900 crowns, can still be.
Our aggregates put it from 410,900 crowns, which is already too much.
The Premium type tested already reaches another 80,000 crowns.
Only we would still have airbag in the headers, automatic air conditioning, automatic windshield wiper, automated rear windows...
That is, the car with everything, costs 531,900 kroner.
It’s a lot, but count on the team’s add-ons at the Fabia and you’ll come up with a pretty similar number.
It is now up to you to decide which of the two brands.
Slovak students do not integrate into English schools
In English schools, children from Eastern European countries attend and therefore, the locals fear more changes in the schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans for now brings only a number of problems.
Even British schools record cases where conflicts between migrants and the children of the natives increase in violence.
The problem of the integration of Eastern European children into British schools is well illustrated in the northern city of Kent where conflicts between natives and Slovak emigrants are beginning to grow.
Discussions, extortion and brawls between students have already reached even the parents themselves.
The situation has come so far that the Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was beating a ten-year-old student with a green stick.
In her defense, she said the girl was insulting her son with racist-sounding insults.
The police also had to act after an attack by two underage girls against a Slovak migrant.
The girls greeted him with racist insults and threw stones at him.
“As we were going home, a boy approached us at the bus stop and started spitting on us.
When I told him to leave, he gave us the urge to throw apples and pears at us, and then he took off his pants and showed us his butt," he described another unpleasant incident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The complaints are from both sides.
One of the natives even designated the conflict with emigrants from Eastern Europe as a struggle for survival.
The cases already mentioned above show us how the environment in English schools starts to be quite tense.
In Great Britain there are 70,000 Slovaks who came here for work reasons.
Approximately 30,000 Slovak students attend English-language schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island in the Caribbean
For visitors it really is the island of freedom.
Anything you expect from your vacation can come to fruition, as long as you choose correctly.
Sandy and golden beaches, big waves or a calm sea like a pond.
the palm trees and the whole encluded with waiters offering pizzas on the beach, ice cream or varied cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and roulette.
On the Caribbean Sea island you can find all this and much more.
Only on one island can you find much more and that island is Cuba, the largest and most beautiful of all the islands of the Great Antilles.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba became the bastion of the conquest of America.
Columbus called it, the most beautiful place the human eye has ever seen.
Havana became a warehouse and cargo port of the treasures that the Spaniards extracted from America and brought to Europe.
Then came the American era.
The Hotel Nacional grew up in the late 1920s.
He was ordered to build one of the heads of the American mafia, Lucky Luciano, since everything that was criminal in the United States (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, gambling and prostitution.
Among his guests were, among others,
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
Tall buildings emerged in Havana, wide avenues running cars that were a symbol of worship in the 50s of the last century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a hacienda in San Francisco de Paula, near Havana, and in Cojimar had his yacht.
On the walls of the Bodeguita del Medio left their signatures the stars of the world of spectacle and politicians from all over America.
What about today?
On the walls of the Bodeguita Ab<0xC3><0xA1>nense you can also leave your autograph.
In the bar of the expensive Hotel Nacional, cocktails are mixed according to your wishes.
And those cars already cult of the 50s, until today continue to operate in Havana, because those Lada and Fiat that arrived long ago have oxidized between these wet and salty winds.
Even though Havana, especially the old quarter, is deteriorating noticeably, there are not as many wonderful colonial monuments as there.
Other places are metamorphosed into beauty, for example, Trinidad.
Because tourism brings so much money, its development is guaranteed.
In the last fifteen years, new hotels have grown not only in Havana but also in Varadero, on the coast of the province of Holgu<0xC3><0xAD>n and on islands such as Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is unique in the world and that is highly valued by railway lovers.
The sugar cane is transported from the immense plantations to the sugar factories by narrow ways in steam or electric machines.
Their cars for decades were not discovered and now they are there, machines that work and whose sister models that exist in other parts of the world are only found in museums.
Where to go?
The most well-known place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, it is not necessary to talk more about Havana or Varadero.
Perhaps, just remember that in the already mentioned hacienda of Hemingway there is a museum that for those who are lovers of the writer, they should not stop visiting it.
The Vi<0xC3><0xB1>ales Valley is the most picturesque corner of Cuba to the west of the island.
Exuberant vegetation that grows on land of limestone.
Mogotes, pylons of limestone rock and rocks of high steepness in the valley falls, and in its caves acclimatize fertile lands thanks to which rocks that hide dense vegetation are formed.
The valley is the place where the highest quality tobacco is probably grown in Cuba.
Visiting one of the habanero cigar factories you can find its final product.
Perhaps it is interesting to someone that the Chilean part of the series, Major Zeman, was filmed there.
Trinidad
Old Abolengo town that was founded not long after the Spanish colonized the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her fame and wealth.
Wealth became beauty with the constructions in the small town.
Spanish colonial architecture, especially influenced by later French settlers, has barely changed in four centuries.
Trinidad, between the sea and the Escambray mountain range, is such a secluded place that even in the 50s of the last century there was no road that united it with the rest of the country.
Such isolation helped her to stay out of the rest.
Nothing new was built and therefore nothing was destroyed either, for each person was happy to have a place to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinidad than a single afternoon, it is worth getting to know interesting places in the nearby surroundings such as Ancona Beach or the valley of sugar factories.
the night belongs to the House of Music, which animates with its music the silence of the mornings.
Baracoa
A small town in the far west of Cuba, some consider it the most beautiful on the island.
Surely that opinion is already confirmed by the path itself.
The two roads that reach there from Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo must pass through high and broken mountains, as well as a nature that barely knows the action of man.
This eastern place of Cuba has been inscribed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO due to its intact nature.
There they make the best chocolate, in their church they have the cross of Columbus (actually it is a cross that arrived 100 years later from the landing) and from the hill, where the castle was and that now there is a hotel with the same name, you can see the mountains and among them the most famous, the Yunque.
Coffee, rum, cigars, the Sierra Maestra, the Bay of Pigs and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the patron saint of Cuba, the Virgin of Charity of Copper, Santer<0xC3><0xAD>a, African religion practiced by the descendants of those slaves, all of which could fill many pages.
However, as they say, it is better to see it sometime.
Allies are passive in Afghanistan, say U.S.
Few soldiers and insufficient equipment needed is what is influencing the progress of the mission in Afghanistan.
NATO, according to US Defense Minister Robert Gates, should design a concrete plan for the coming years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not turning out as expected, the representatives of the countries that have troops in the southern part of the country agreed in Edinburgh (Scotland).
As conflicts with the Taliban grow, today the eight participating states discuss the plans and coordination of the allies.
While the United States this week through its defense minister, Robert Gates, encouraged NATO forces to do more, Britain sees it as a priority to strengthen the Afghan government’s authority and share development aid.
“Development in Afghanistan is palpable but the armed forces can only be one solution.
The next step is to make it possible for the population to start economic and security development on their own," Defence Minister Des Browne told the BBC.
The Ninety Percent
Afghan rebels’ activity, according to U.S. military data, is higher than in the past five years.
The number of violent actions increased by 27 percent compared to the last year, and in Helmand province up to 60 percent.
NATO countries have about 40,000 troops in Afghanistan, a quarter of which are in the south of the territory.
However, for the United States, the allies have reached the same limit in terms of the organization and equipment of the units.
They are exactly asking for more helicopters, soldiers and experts to train Afghan units.
“We will have to think seriously about concrete goals for the future and how we will achieve them,” Gates said.
In a similar vein, NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop also spoke today.
“I’m not happy to know what we have on earth and heaven in Afghanistan.
We have ninety percent of the troops and equipment we would need, and that's little," De Hoop told Reuters at the close of the three-day meeting with the Japanese government in Tokyo.
Who is passive
Among the countries attending in recent months is the controversy over whether all allies are doing their best in Afghanistan.
Passively he was criticized, for example, Germany.
“The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in an area of minimal violence and the fighting demands there are not as high as in ours, in the southern and eastern part of the country," Gates said.
The sensationalist newspaper Sun this week called the German soldiers vague.
“Afghan rebels discover that the Germans are engaged in playing while our boys are fighting,” Sun wrote in a material accompanied by photographs of German soldiers playing table tennis.
The German Bild responded to the attack and posted a photograph where the British troops were playing a rugby match in southern Afghanistan.
Government Debt to Reach Billions in 2009
For every Czech, the state owes 84,000 kroner.
Total debt in September amounted to 842.7 billion kroner.
This year the government planned to lend 159.2 billion kroner.
However, at the beginning of December the ministry reduced the plan to 152.8 billion kroner thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the state budget economy.
The state debt of the Czech Republic increased at the end of September to 842.7 billion kroner.
In nine months of this year it increased by 40.2 billion kronor.
However, since June it has decreased by 13.4 billion kronor.
So today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the state debt of early October.
For each Czech, the debt corresponds to 84,000 kroner.
For the whole of last year the state was indebted with more than 111 million kroner.
“For now it seems that thanks to the low deficit next year we could cross the billion-crown border until 2009.
Next year the debt should move between 900 billion and one trillion crowns," said David Marek, an economist at Patria Finance, to the server iHNed.cz.
In a similar way, Next Finance economist Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pikora also sees it: "We could spend a billion during 2009.
Exactly when that will depend on the next budget we don’t know yet.
If the situation on the political scene were to change and politicians were able to save, then it could be delayed to 2010.
But I don’t see that change,” he added.
Doubt is growing
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and arises, above all, from the accumulation of the deficit of the state budget.
The state debt is paid by means of treasury bonds, state bonds, direct loans or, for example, loans from the European Investment Bank.
The state’s domestic debt grew this year from 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion kroner.
Foreign debt has so far grown from 1.7 billion kroner to 123.3 billion kroner.
The so-called negotiable debt of the state at the end of September contained 803.3 billion z-crowns since June was reduced by 13.7 billion z-crowns.
The average maturity of the state debt increased by 6.5 years.
“The total year-on-year debt from the first to the third quarter created 13 percent which is huge given how the economy works.
It is interesting that growth is generated mainly from obligations where there is a growth of 20 percent.
It is bad that the debt is growing but on the other hand it shows that it is going to be negotiated until there is a pension reform," Pikora said.
Better than expected
From the strategy of payments and debt management of the state for the year 2007 it is extracted that the government planned this year to lend 159.2 billion kroner.
At the beginning of December, the ministry reduced the plan by 152.8 billion crowns thanks to the improvement of the evolution of the state budget.
The amount is composed, above all, of the state budget deficit that this year will be 76 million crowns instead of the planned 91.3 billion crowns.
The rest consists of maximum planned resources for the Czech Consolidation Agency with about 13.3 billion kroner, the reservation of 10 billion kroner for the payment of pensions, 43 billion kroner to finance the state's obligations and 1.8 billion kroner in payments of loans from the European Investment Bank.
I was comparing today in front of a court in Khartoum to having given a name to a teddy bear
The British teacher tried in Sudan for insulting Islam was sentenced Thursday afternoon by a court in Khartoum to 15 days in prison and deportation, her lawyer said.
The British woman was accused of letting pupils aged 6 to 7 give the name of Mohammed to a teddy bear when any depiction of the prophet of Islam is illegal.
He was suffering from a whipping pain.
The 54-year-old British schoolteacher at Unity High School in Khartoum, Sudan, was arrested on Sunday at her home and charged with assaulting Islam and sedition under article 125 of the Sudanese Penal Code, as a result of several complaints from parents of students to the Sudanese Ministry of Education.
The story actually goes back to September, when this teacher asks her students, 6/7 years old, to choose a name for the class teddy bear.
“Eight names come out of children’s mouths, like Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed,” says school principal Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a class vote, 20 children out of 23 have chosen Mohamed as their preferred name.
Mohamed is of course the name of the Muslim prophet, but above all a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have made a book for the class with the picture of the bear with the following legend "My name is Mohamed ".
The bear himself did not bear any label with this name, but the problem is simply that of the depiction of the prophet regarded as an insult to Islam.
One of Gillian Gibbons’ Muslim colleagues, a teacher at the same school in Sudan, said she knew her well and that she would never have done anything that could be insulting to a religious faith, “I’m just sorry I asked the children to vote for a name,” according to him, it’s just an “innocent mistake.”
Opinion divided by numerous students of the schoolteacher who describe her as "very attentive to her students " and " who never talks about religion in class "..
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the second most given name in Britain, it is written in English with 14 different modes.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way of honoring the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules regarding the use of this name?
Can we give it to a toy, for example?
It is, of course, a matter of interpretation.
They have not reached an agreement on Wednesday on the future status of the province, during the last session of negotiations in Vienna.
In the end, failure.
The Serbs and Albanians of Kosovo have concluded a sixth and final session of discussions in Baden, Austria, on Wednesday morning, without having been able to overcome their differences over the future status of the separatist province.
"It is regrettable that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the status," European mediator Wolfgang Ischinger told a news conference in Vienna.
Stressing that peace in the region was " at stake", his American counterpart, Frank Wisner, urged Belgrade and Pristina to respect their efforts to preserve peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
"We do not foresee violence for now but we are entering a very difficult period," he added, noting that "obvious tensions exist."
End of mediation on December 10
The mediators of the troika, which regroups the European Union, the United States and Russia, will go to Serbia and Kosovo for the last time on Monday.
The future of the 90% Albanian-populated province could become clearer when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko return their relationship to the UN Security Council, by December 10.
The talks in Baden, near Vienna, were the sixth and final session of negotiations since the troika was tasked with a new mediation by the UN last August.
Americans and Europeans believe that their mediation will end on December 10.
The Russians, who have already blocked the granting of independence in Kosovo in the Security Council, insist on pursuing negotiations beyond this deadline.
“Russia was and remains committed to a negotiated solution, a compromise solution,” Botsane-Khartchenko said.
Declaration of Unilateral Independence?
After eight years of UN administration in Kosovo, Westerners consider independence under the supervision of the European Union to be the only viable solution.
Pristina feels ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve in its favour.
Belgrade insists on increased autonomy.
"Unfortunately, no agreement has been reached," said Fatmir Sejdiu, president of Kosovo's autonomous authority, at the Baden hotel where these "last chance negotiations" had been held since Monday.
Hashim Thaci, former commander of the Kosovo rebellion and future prime minister of the province, has given part of his condolences.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade "belonged to a past that has led to homicides and deportations."
" Domino Effect "
Serbian President Boris Tadic, for his part, has considered that a compromise was always feasible, warning the Albanian majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of independence of the province.
Belgrade particularly fears a " domino effect " in a region still weakened by the wars of independence in the 1990s.
"For Serbia, he said, this does not mean that a compromise is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had insisted that any decision belongs exclusively to the Security Council, in which its Russian ally has a veto.
" The Parliament of Kosovo will have the last word "
"Only a solution within the Security Council is acceptable to Serbia," Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica had said.
“These negotiations have been going on for two years.
They must end as they have begun: in the Security Council."
To journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had replied that " the Kosovo Parliament will have the final say on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence on the part of Albanians would be made " in consultation " with Westerners.
Bush pulls out agreement between Israelis and Palestinians
President George Bush announced, during the opening of his own international peace conference in Annapolis, Maryland, on Tuesday, that Israelis and Palestinians had finally agreed on a joint statement.
He said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had agreed to immediately enter into negotiations to find a final settlement of the 60-year-old dispute between their two peoples.
In the presence of both men, Bush promised that he would do everything to help them conclude a “peace treaty” before the end of 2008.
In the meantime, Palestinians must dismantle “terrorist infrastructure” and Israel must end its colonization activities, Bush said, recalling both sides’ obligations to the peace itinerary they accepted in 2003.
The White House chief stressed that negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority chaired by Abbas would attempt "to conclude a peace treaty that would resolve all outstanding issues, without exception, including core issues " .
This denomination covers the three main problems of the litigious point between Israelis and Palestinians: the future borders of Palestine, the status of Jerusalem and the fate of Arab refugees expelled from their homes during the 1948 conflict.
Taking the floor after the US president, Abbas insisted that the upcoming negotiations be “global and in-depth” and refer to all aspects of a regulation, citing “Jerusalem, refugees, borders, colonies, water, security, among other things.”
Upon his return to the gallery, Olmert pledged to make future negotiations “direct and ongoing” and to make “an effort to conclude them over the course of 2008.”
At the end of 2008, Bush set the deadline for the implementation of his " vision of two co-existing Palestinian and Israeli states " .
Saudi Arabia revealed that it had made a commitment in this regard on the part of Bush before deciding to participate in the conference.
Arabia, whose participation in Annapolis is a success for Washington, is at the beginning of a plan, endorsed by all Arab countries, that proposes peace for Israel in return for its withdrawal from all Arab territories occupied during the 1967 war, including East Jerusalem.
Annapolis marks "a point of confrontation in the history of the Middle East, more particularly because it attacks the roots of the conflict and its central aspects," Prince Saud said in his Arab newspaper interview with Saudi capitals.
For the prosecutor, the police are not responsible.
What exactly happened last Sunday?
Just like every time in this type of events, official versions and rumors are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?
According to the first elements of the investigation of the General Inspectorate of the French National Police (IGPN), a police car was circulating on Sunday, shortly after 17 Luisa-Miguel Street, to Villiers-le-Bel.
“I was not in intervention but on patrol, and I was driving at 40-50 km/h, without a rotating headlight,” a police source explains.
A Kawasaki-branded green motorcycle, " not approved, or not authorized to run on the public road " (read below) and driven by two young people without helmets, was running " all gas " .
"He hit the police car on the left side, after a breach of the yield step to the right," the police said.
The control of alcoholemia practiced on the occupants of the vehicle was negative.
The condition of the car (the front unfurled, windshield cracked, bumper torn off) testifies to the violence of the crash.
Very quickly, yesterday morning, the prosecutor of the Republic of Pontoise, Marie-Thér<0xC3><0xA8>re de Givry, announced that he had entrusted an investigation into " acts of involuntary manslaughter and denial of aid " to the IGPN, co-chaired by the departmental directorate of public security of Val-d'Oise.
In the afternoon, during a press conference, the prosecutor states that the IGPN investigation, at this stadium, ruled out the responsibility of the police.
According to the judge, three witnesses of the accident, understood on Sunday afternoon, confirmed "the version of the police, namely that this mini-bike arrived relatively quickly to his left ".
Yesterday, a type of groove, no doubt caused by the rubbing of the shoes on the ground, showed that both vehicles had been stuck in time for the police car to come to a stop.
The vehicles have been confiscated and will be subject to technical expertise.
The bodies of both victims were autopsied yesterday.
What happened right after?
Yesterday, a rumor quickly circulated through Villiers-le-Bel, according to which the police would have left the site very quickly, thus not providing relief to both young people.
The IGPN, being prudent, would also remove " any serious fault " with regard to this point.
"It's the most difficult aspect of the investigation, which needs more research, about which you have to be very careful," a police source said.
Liberation found an eyewitness to these few moments that have followed the accident.
One of his windows that precisely gives to the scene.
“We went down right away, with my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital, to try to resuscitate them,” this witness tells us.
There was nothing to do.”
Then he saw "a completely frightened policeman, who was limping.
Two others were trying to resuscitate one of the young people, the fourth was talking on the phone.”
Faced with the tension that quickly surrounded the scene, and, it seems, to the certainty that people were present of the unexpected situation of the young people, the police have been driven by colleagues who had arrived at the site.
Always according to this witness, the rescues arrived “about twenty minutes after the march of the police”.
They also practiced heart massages, in vain.
" I will not assume that the police services did not provide assistance to the young people.
These young people have been rescued.
Firefighters arrived immediately.
Everything has been done to try to save them,” the prosecutor stressed.
Tensions rise in Pakistan
Pakistani police on Monday repressed the first demonstrations since the state of emergency was established two days earlier by General Musharraf.
In the eastern city of Lahore, nearly 2,000 lawyers protesting against the measures taken under the state of emergency have been injured by tear gas grenades used by law enforcement, witnesses said.
The latter responded with stone-throwing, injuring police officers.
At least 350 lawyers have been interviewed.
Scenes similar to Karachi and Rawalpindi, where police officers charged and injured lawyers.
Many would have been questioned.
In Islamabad, Supreme Court lawyers called for a general strike and announced demonstrations, following a wave of about 500 arrests over the weekend of opponents, human rights activists and lawyers.
The streets that gave access to the Supreme Court were blocked on Monday morning to prevent the grouping.
Other demonstrations would have taken place in Multan (centre) and Peshawar (northwest).
The lawyers’ movement gathered on Monday the support of the regrouped religious parties in the powerful Muttahida Majlis-e-Amal alliance whose president “urged the population to send flowers to judges who spoke out against the state of emergency and the wastes they swore an oath to in front of Musharraf.”
" Musharraf's promise no longer fulfills "
The Pakistani Supreme Court is directly concerned with the exception measure announced on Saturday afternoon.
It had to decide in the coming days on the legality of the re-election to the presidential elections, on October 6, to the indirect vote, of President Musharraf.
The President of the Court, Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry, has been removed and replaced.
“Everything we attend is illegal, unconstitutional and contrary to the rulings of the Supreme Court,” the judge told The News.
Pervez Musharraf's promise to leave the army and become a civilian president " values no more " after the establishment of the state of emergency, he told Assistant Minister of Information Tariq Azeem on Monday.
He was expected to leave his military uniform by 15 November, the date of the end of his first presidential term.
The Assistant Minister of Information also confirmed that the January elections could be postponed.
On the other hand, the Pakistani government has denied persistent rumors in the country that President Musharraf has been assigned to residence by his deputy army chief.
More than a third of pregnancies remain unplanned
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
More than one in three pregnancies (36%) is still unplanned, according to a study by the National Institute for Demographic Studies (Ined), 40 years after the vote on the Neuwirth law that liberalized contraception in France.
This calculation takes into account unwanted pregnancies (24%) as well as unplanned or unplanned births.
Different methods of contraception such as the pill or the sterile still have a failure rate of 5% to 6%, Ined estimates.
The liberalization of contraception, however, allowed for a better "dominance of fertility", according to the institute, which notes that the rate of pill use among women aged 20 to 44 years has increased from 5% in 1970 to 60% today.
At last, eight out of ten births would be well planned today.
Even calculated little more or less per month for a couple out of five and if possible for spring, season judged as the most pleasant to have a child.
Spectacular repair on the space station
It will have taken more than seven hours of space work for astronaut Scott Parazynski and his crewmates from the International Space Station (ISS) to perform the spectacular repair of a torn solar panel and indispensable for the continuation of the station’s scientific activities.
A risky exit that accumulated records because of its duration, its distance from the habitable modules, the speed with which it has been imagined, instruments "padded" by the astronauts to carry out the repair.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronauts had released the Harmony module from the Discovery shuttle, a cylindrical thick piece in charge of soon hosting the European and Japanese scientific laboratories (see box).
This module is a type of landing platform for modules-laboratories.
But you have to be able to supply them with electricity.
The second task of the crew was to move an electricity production module with solar panels weighing 17.5 tons, already present on the ISS, in order to put it in its final position.
After having moved it, the crew began the reorganization of the solar panels of the module that have a wingspan of 76 meters.
And that’s where one of the panels, which are deployed as accordions, has been damaged in a little over a meter by a stranded cable.
The deployment has been stopped so as not to further damage the panel.
The astronauts, who had at first to make a control exit of the Discovery shuttle, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defective, were forced to dedicate themselves to the damaged panel.
And it is Scott Parazynski who has been chosen to go to the snail at the end of the 30 meters length of the remote-controlled arm of the shuttle added to that of the station to perform the repair.
He is one of NASA’s best spacewalkers.
Tall, sturdy, very skilful, has a very developed torso and long arms.
At the age of 46, this training doctor has been commissioned to "operate" the "wounded" solar panel.
After having precisely inspected the damage, he severed the fallible cable and installed types of "tables" in the damaged area.
He had been helped by the second "spacewalker" who had stayed near the airlock and, from the inside, by other astronauts such as Peggy Whitson, the crew commander.
The tool he used, an insulator-wrapped hockey ministick to avoid electrocution on solar panels that produced several hundred volts, has been conceived and “sprayed” by astronauts aboard the station.
Once the operation was over, Scott Parazynski waited for the panel to be fully deployed before making the inventory of his instruments and returning to the inside of the station.
Yesterday afternoon, the astronauts were taking advantage of a midday break before today, seven astronauts return from the Discovery shuttle to return to Earth scheduled for Wednesday.
The EADS title sanctioned on the Stock Exchange
The EADS stock is currently in sharp decline on the Paris Stock Exchange, after the aeronautics and defense group announced that it will have to spend between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros to cope with the delays of the A400M.
EADS currently loses 4% to 21.96 euros on the Paris Stock Exchange.
The group has been forced to revise its 2007 operating result forecast in response to delays engendered by the slow development of the A400M engine, which conditions the aircraft’s maiden flight.
The cost to alleviate the delay in delivery of the military transport aircraft, announced in October, amounts to “between 1.2 and 1.4 billion euros of which more than 1 billion for Airbus”, announced the parent company of the European manufacturer EADS.
Due to these burdens, EADS will be forced to announce new EBIT targets for 2007 during the presentation of its quarterly results next Thursday, it adds without any more ciphered accuracy.
The group also indicates that the estimate of the new loads is consistent with the six-month delay.
It should be remembered that EADS’ operating result failed by 86% in 2006, mainly due to delays linked to another program, the very thick carrier A380.
Initially, the group envisioned a first delivery of the A400M to the French Army in October 2009.
The choice of the status quo
No surprise on Sunday, at the exit of the polls: the Russians will massively opt for the party of President Putin, united Russia.
Confirming his aspiration for stability, even authoritarianism, after a very limited campaign.
Three days before the legislative elections, Russian President Vladimir Putin is sending voters a televised message on public networks, already registered but whose content is kept secret.
He does so as a leader of the list for united Russia, the pro-Kremlin party whose victory proves overwhelming.
Yesterday, the president did not let anything become transparent by receiving foreign ambassadors, contenting himself with handing over a new charge against the West accused of meddling - his theme of predilection during the campaign.
“We know the price of a true democracy and we want honest, more transparent and more open elections, elections without incidents,” he added.
According to the opposition, we are far from the truth.
It denounces a campaign tainted by pressure.
Communist leader Gennadi Ziouganov says there has been “never had such a dirty election, even in the time of Yeltsin.”
After the crackdown on demonstrations last weekend, former chess world champion Garry Kasparov, sentenced to five days in prison for illegal demonstrations, is banned from visiting, according to his lawyer.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the Soviet homo"
Behind these unsurprising legislative elections are two much more open questions:
Who will succeed Putin to the presidency?
The official newspaper published yesterday the date of the first round of the presidential election, March 2, 2008; candidates have until December 23 to be announced.
Elected in 2000 and re-elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot seek the third consecutive term.
Then no successor emerges.
What role will Putin play after March?
The Prime Minister?
Head of the parliamentary majority and of the very powerful United Russia party that would elect the government and the president?
Whatever it is, in legislative as well as presidential elections, the outgoing power will triumph.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians kept the mentality of the homo sovieticus, they do not feel they own their destiny," says sociologist Lev Goudkov, director of the independent center Levada.
The historian Nikolai Kopossov of St. Petersburg State University goes back further: civil society was delayed in this Christianized country five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community delayed the formation of individualism.
After the liberal reforms of the 1990s, "Poutine restored the model of a paternalistic state, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic slump," estimates Maria Lipman, of the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " willingly renounce personal responsibility " of those who had briefly given evidence after the outbreak of the USSR.
"Why reflect?"
The phenomenon touches all social layers, including the world of affairs.
And the administrative elite intends to preserve the status quo: 65 governors (out of every 85 heads of Russian regions) run the local lists of united Russia.
The new freedoms imported from the West are often synonymous with chaos, as in the 1990s.
Opinion prefers stability.
In the name of the fact that the Russians will not vote for the extremists either.
Conclusion of Tamara Cherednitchenko, 54-year-old teacher: " What to reflect?
Those in power are not too bad, why change them?”
A heavy memory
After more than 60 years of confidentiality, the Bad Arolsen Nazi archives, which describe the fates of 17.5 million victims of the Hitler regime, are in free access.
The 47 million file documents, stored over 27 km of shelves in Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not up to now available only for a "humanitarian" purpose, that is, individually and nominally, at the request of a former victim or his rightholders.
The eleven States in charge of its management – such as Germany, France, Israel and the United States – agreed in May 2006 to open them to seekers and historians.
Since the process of ratification of this agreement by all States has been completed, the opening has been effective since yesterday.
Sensitive Information
Historians' access to Bad Arolsen will allow searches to be made "particularly on the displacement of prisoners, the population of the camps and the health status of forced laborers," explains Reto Meistern, the director of these archives administered by the International Commission on the Red Cross (ICRC).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, opposed the opening to the public of these nominative documents, due to the sensitive nature of certain information.
As well as the alleged homosexuality or mental handicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration camps or detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after the war for a practical purpose: to find the peasants deported or subjected to forced labour and, eventually, to provide them with proof of their internment, in order to pave the way for their compensation.
Even today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent employees deal with tens of thousands of individual petitions.
However, for a part of the scientific community, access to Bad Arolsen is of limited interest.
“There is nothing fundamentally new to be expected from these documents,” said Professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Research Center on Antisemitism at Technische Universit<0xC3><0xA4>t Berlin in 2006.
The European Union and India want to reach a free trade agreement in 2008
Currently, Indo-European bilateral trade already reaches about 60 billion euros per year.
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
The European Union and India expect to sign a free trade agreement in 2008, said European Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson and his Indian counterpart, Kamal Nath.
In April, the European Union's foreign ministers had given their approval to the European Commission to start negotiations to sign free trade agreements (FTAs) with India, South Korea and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Indo-European bilateral trade is already approaching <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion a year.
The European Union is India’s first trading partner and accounts for 18% of its foreign trade.
LUE is also its first foreign investor, but India is only the 9th trading partner of the European Union, according to figures from the European Commission.
"A free trade agreement will do a lot for both economies," and "India would improve its entry into a market of 450 million prosperous Europeans," Mandelson said.
Europe represents the first or second market for each of the top ten products exported by India, said the European Commissioner. The Asian and European Commission's European giants are annually traded for " 47 billion euros of goods" and " ten billion euros of services", said this week Dani<0xC3><0xA8>le Smadja, head of the European Commission's delegation in New Delhi.

Bank of England takes note of concerns offering <0xC2><0xA3>10bn in five weeks
The Bank of England on Thursday was concerned about relieving the current round of concerns over credit conditions, and announced a <0xC2><0xA3>10bn offer at the 5.75% base rate in five weeks, an unusual deal.
" To alleviate concerns that financial market conditions will be particularly tight at the end of the year, and to give banks greater certainty as to how they will organize their liquidity positions over this period, the Bank intends to offer a significant proportion of its expected reserve contribution during the maintenance period beginning on 6 December in an open-ended form.
The bank states that <0xC2><0xA3>10 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>14 billion) will be put on the market on December 6 at 12:15 GMT, at the base index and until January 10.
It is the first time it appears that the Bank of England BoE puts on the market liquidity for five weeks in an open market operation.
These are usually done in a week.
The BoE adds in its statement that " it is prepared to take further steps to keep the " interbank loan rates up to date in line with its base rate.
The interbank index per day was 5.829 % on Wednesday.
The index after three months was set at 6.6%, the highest since September 18.
Since the start of the summer financial crisis, the sums put on the market by the Bank of England were combined with a significant penalty rate that had deterred banks from resorting to that.
According to certain rumors, corroborated by the evolution of the exchange rate of the pound against the euro, many had preferred to subscribe to the sums brought to the market by the European Central Bank, to the most advantageous indices and with a more assured discretion.
The UMP and NC parties deny consideration of the PS party’s proposals on purchasing power
The UMP group and Nouveau Centre on Thursday refused to discuss articles of the socialist bill on purchasing power, which amounts to a rejection of the text.
Registered in a socialist "niche" (session for the initiative of a parliamentary group), the text declined a dozen measures adopted on Tuesday by the national office of the PS among which the increase of 50% of the surplus for employment, the re-establishment of the floating TIPP (internal rate for oil products), a check-transport or restrictions on rent.
Since UMP and NC have voted against the examination of the articles (180 votes to 115), the session has been lifted at the end of the general discussion that resulted in exchanges, sometimes live, between majority and opposition to a few hours of Nicolas Sarkozy’s televised intervention on purchasing power.
PS leader Jean Marc Ayrault announced that his group would represent the integrity of his proposals in the form of amendments to the amending finance bill examined by the Assembly next week.
A new festival comes to light
As a result of numerous rumors regarding the creation, by C3 Presents, of a new music festival in Philadelphia, the promoter / producer announces the Vineland Music Festival in New Jersey, in collaboration with Festival Republic of the British producer Melvin Benn.
“For our company, it’s an honor to work with a person who inspired, no more no less, the current festival movement in America,” Charlie Jones of C3 told Billboard.com.
C3 produces the Chicago Lollapalooza Festival and the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Vineland, New Jersey, is a summer destination for camping.
The festival is set to take place August 8-10 on a private 500-acre farm about 40 minutes from Philadelphia.
Formerly known as Mean Fiddler, Festival Republic director Melvin Benn is one of the most respected festival producers in the world.
In 1989, he took the helm of the Reading Festival in the United Kingdom, which attracts about 80,000 people annually.
In 1999, Melvin Benn added the Leeds Festival to his portfolio then, in 2006, the Festival Republic created the Henham Park Latitude Festival in Suffolk.
Since 2002, as co-owner, Melvin Benn has also been in charge of producing, licensing and organising the Glastonbury Festival, which can now accommodate up to 177,500 people.
Calling Glastonbury the " most inspiring event " that he has ever attended, C3's Charlie Jones says his company and Melvin Benn's are working in parallel to give the region a European-style festival-event.
“We had chosen Philadelphia as our market and worked with perseverance with the Fairmount Parks Commission to create a festival in downtown Philadelphia,” says Charlie Jones.
" We were in negotiations with the city and the Commission was motivated and enthusiastic about this project.
Unfortunately, we are stuck in low-level politics because of the current administration, Charlie Jones says.
“Fortunately, we were able to discuss with Melvin Benn and prepare to create a magnificent festival at an exceptional venue that has recently taken place in Philadelphia.”
C3 Presents resurrected the Lollapalooza festival in 2005 at Chicago’s Grant Park, after having demarcated itself in the festival landscape in 2002 with the Austin City Limits Music Festival.
Both events recorded gross revenues of $9.8M and $11.3M respectively in 2007.
These two festivals take place in an urban environment.
“The European model of Melvin Benn is a country festival, while ours are performed rather in urban green areas,” says Charlie Jones.
The goal is to merge, in one way or another, both formulas to give both a country festival impression to the European and urban way to the American way.”
Vineland is roughly halfway between Philadelphia and Atlantic City.
“The Vineland community, including the mayor, enthusiastically supports the celebration of this event,” says Charlie Jones.
The latter refuses to reveal the terms of the agreement, but states "that they are quite interesting to allow to invest in such an event and host a festival that, we hope, will have a long life."
Charlie Jones says the festival’s hotel offering is “very large,” such as the 80,000-person Bonnaroo Music Festival in Tennessee.
He says that invitations have been released to the groups, but that nothing could still be confirmed at the time of the press release.
“Vineland will have the taste of rock, but the music will be varied there, hoping to attract all kinds of viewers,” says Charlie Jones.
His C3 teammates, who received the Top Independent Promoter award from the last Billboard Touring Awards, are Charlie Walker and Charles Attal.
Montreal to face Terminator
It’s not easy to attract Hollywood moviegoers to Montreal when nothing more than Terminator opposes that.
This mission of seduction is part of the functions of a delegate.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger denounces the "runaway productions".
Is it hard to compete with the Governor?
“You have to be careful, it’s the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favorable, you will go there.
Our role is to offer the ones that are going to judge the best,” he says.
The Race to the Festivals
At the moment, the priority of Denis Turcotte is nevertheless the promotion of cinema here.
The race for the Oscars has begun.
All West Coast festivals, be it Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to present Quebec movies, give them value and make sure the filmmakers do interviews.
The Age of Darkness had a good image at the 30th Mill Valley Film Festival a few weeks ago.
It will be presented at the Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is on a Santa Monica billboard and will be presented at the 30th Starz Denver Film Festival in November.
Quebec also presented four feature films and four short films at the American Film Institute Fest this month.
Will there be a rally at the end of the year on the stock market? The experts, divided by the crisis 'subprime'.
Less than five weeks before the end of the year, investors are already rubbing their hands in anticipation of the traditional end-of-year rally.
However, this year experts are not so clear that this is going to happen.
Banif believes that "from a statistical point of view, the month of December on the stock exchange usually has a positive behavior.
However, it is not advisable to make forecasts based solely on statistics, especially since in the current context, uncertainties lurk in the markets, at least in the short term."
Although they are not in favor of the stock market picking up in the last weeks of the year, these experts point out that "the stock market is sustained by the existence of liquidity, willing to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially fixed income, affected by the effect of flight towards quality values both in the long and in the short stretches".
Therefore, they believe that the stock exchange will have a rather lateral behavior, not exempt from volatility "especially because the impact of the likely fall in Fed rates is not known, given the high level of crude and the danger of stimulating inflationary tensions."
Javier Barrio, head of sales at BPI in Spain, agrees that it is not a good time to venture to say that there will be a rally.
“It’s not the thing for a lot of joys,” the expert says.
The Ibex has lost about 4% from the highs set on November 8 when the index closed at 15,945.7 points.
Still, not all experts have such a negative view.
Juan Solana, an analyst at Intermoney, believes that the Ibex 35 could close the year closer to 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of the portfolios and the traditional contributions to pension plans that occur every year on these dates.
However, the expert nudges that things will be somewhat different this year as he believes the rally will move forward to the second week of December, after the Constitution bridge.
The analyst does not believe that volatility will affect the market trend.
Federico Olucha, an analyst at Inversis Banco, said: “We are close to technical levels and therefore we could see a rebound in the index that could be boosted depending on the news coming from the US regarding the consequences of the crisis in the credit market.”
The analyst is confident that these will be positive.
Analysts agree when choosing the values that will be responsible for bringing the Ibex to new maximum levels.
Solana, of Intermoney, says that "this year is about great values".
The expert would include in the portfolio the two large banks and some builders "because when the date comes, the electricity sector will be very expensive."
Meanwhile, Federico Olucha, of Inversis Banco, assures that the increases will come from the hand of the banking and industrial sector.
Builders will also be able to benefit from this rally, should it happen.
"ACS has been recovering positions for several months and we expect other builders like Ferrovial and FCC to follow their own path," he said.
The cyclical consumption will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the increase in sales in the Christmas sales season.
On the other hand, the expert believes that the technological ones will also do very well, although in this case there is not much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, December has been a bearish month on only two occasions.
The real end-of-year rally took place in 2003, an exercise in which stock markets emerged from the crisis caused by the puncture of the technological bubble.
This year, in which the Ibex 35 recovered 28.17%, December recorded a rebound of 6.68%.
We will have to see if 2007 is the fifth consecutive year of earnings (at the moment the Ibex rises by 8.36% since January) and if it can count on its year-end rally.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours Monday to Saturday
Popular has decided to renovate much of its offices.
In total, 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These branches, which will operate under the Popular Max brand, represent a big change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, since it is the first group that decides to take the leap to bet on the uninterrupted opening of their agencies until 20.30 pm, and open on Saturdays from 10 am to 20.30 pm.
Another group that has also reiterated on several occasions that it wanted to expand the schedules of its branches, BBVA, has not yet decided to take the step.
Meanwhile, he is about to close a deal with unions to close 75% of his offices on Saturdays in exchange for opening an afternoon, though not to the public.
The results of Popular’s experience will be decisive for other entities to join or not to join this initiative that follows the schedules of the trades.
This is precisely the goal Popular pursues with the project.
Capture the private customers who move around these areas to make their purchases, to the SMEs, self-employed and shops of the streets chosen to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 offices open throughout Spain in about 18 months, since they are not new openings but remodeling of the existing ones.
To do this, the entity will modernize the branches it already has in commercial areas, adapting them to the profile presented by the customers of the different streets.
In this way, the expansion of the schedules is accompanied by a different conception of the branch space and a new, more modern design with brighter colors.
The head of commercial banking, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivera, says that this restructuring does not involve a large investment, although a greater recruitment of staff, since it goes from having about six employees per local to eight or nine.
The offices, which will even have spaces for SMEs to meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already tested its initiative in three offices in Madrid.
And the experience has been positive, <0xC3><0x81>ngel Rivero explains.
The branches of the streets Bravo Murillo, O'Donnell and Gran V<0xC3><0xAD>a de Madrid have been chosen, and it seems that rightly so, according to Rivero.
Popular currently has 2,500 branches.
And another 60 that operate under the brand Mundocredit, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide schedules, which even open on Sundays and holidays.
In these premises PopularMax will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices have a large range of non-financial products for sale.
“We don’t want to compete with our customers,” Rivero says.
At the moment, they have reached an agreement with Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica to sell mobile phones, with staff outside the bank.
Telecinco doubles for the first time the stock market value of its rival Antena 3
We've got it.
With that phrase he expressed yesterday his satisfaction Paolo Vasile, CEO of Telecinco, at the close of the market, when he found that the chain he runs doubled the value of his rival, Antena 3.
Only one aspect tarnished his joy: "It's what hurts me, it's not because we've grown more but because we've come down less," he said.
Still, he stressed that in a weak market, “we’ve fallen less.”
Telecinco finished the day yesterday with an advance of 2.54%.
That profit puts its loss on what we have been doing this year at 15.66%.
The stock market value of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and owned by Vocento (another 13%) thus reaches 4,488.88 million euros, according to data from Bloomberg.
Its rival Antena 3, which yesterday yielded 1.52% and accumulated a decrease of 40.5% since January, costs half, 2,193.46 million.
The value of the other listed communication companies amounts to 3,571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2,518,53 million Prisa (editor of Five Days) and 1,779 million Vocento.
According to Vasile, the comparison with Antena 3 is due to the fact that 'we are talking about two similar companies.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, in the same market, at what cost and how we make it profitable in terms of audience.”
Telecinco announced last week that it plans to become the first television network this year to exceed 1 billion gross advertising revenues, said Giuseppe Tringali, the CEO of Telecinco and Publiespa<0xC3><0xB1>a, the subsidiary that manages the group’s advertising.
If this announced data becomes reality, the television network would record this year an increase of 3.6% in its advertising turnover compared to the 965.4 million in the 2006 fiscal year.
For its part, the net turnover of Antena 3 increased by 1.6% in the first nine months of the year (to reach 734.4 million) while the net income of television grew by 0.7% (630.4 million).
One of the factors that analysts point to for the best relative evolution in Telecinco Stock Exchange is the high pay out it has maintained so far: in 2006, the company chaired by Alejandro Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a distributed 100% of the profit among its shareholders.
Vasile says that although it is early to make the decision, this ratio could vary after the purchase of 33% of Endemol in association with its parent Mediaset.
“We have the official commitment to give at least 50%, although we have always stated much more.
This year, I hope we will be able to make our shareholders happy, who we have already valued with 33% of Endemol’.
According to analysts, the market is showing signs of fatigue at this time.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its profit estimates on Telecinco by 4% in 2008 and 7% in 2009.
It is due to the fact that it has cut projected revenue growth from 10.5% to 8.4% in 2008 and from 5.5% to 5.1% in 2009.
This same firm has lowered Antena 3’s profit forecast by 4.5% in 2008 and 7.5% in 2009.

Congress approves the transposition of the Mifid, which entered into force on 1 November
In parallel to its parliamentary process, which ended today with the vote by Congress on the amendments incorporated into the bill in the Senate, the government has submitted to a public hearing the regulation that will develop the new law, with the aim of both entering into force before the end of the year.
The representatives of the different groups agreed to highlight the effort made by deputies and senators to negotiate and agree on the best regulations in order to ensure the protection of investors and regulate in detail the activity of the entities so that the markets function efficiently.
The Mifid, which amends the Securities Market Act, involves the modernization of financial markets, while strengthening investor protection, improving the supervisory powers of the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) and encouraging cooperation between the various supervisors of the European Union.
The new regulation will allow financial advisory services to be provided to both specialized firms and individuals or legal entities and creates a new type of financial services firms (ESIS), financial advisory societies (AFI), which join securities companies, securities agencies and portfolio management companies.
In addition, it expands the number of systems for the execution of operations on financial instruments, so that the regulated secondary markets are joined by multilateral trading systems and order internalization systems, which will compete with current exchange managers.
The Act also obliges investment services companies to disclose on the market information on the key aspects of their business profile, risk exposure and forms of risk management and requires them to keep a record of all the operations they carry out, in order to facilitate the supervision by the CNMV.
In its passage by the Congressional Economic Commission, several modifications were incorporated, among which it highlights that securitized debt is considered a "complex" financial instrument given its high risk to the investor, which has been demonstrated with what happened with U.S. high-risk mortgage debt (subprime).
In addition, the transposition of the directive was used to legally delimit the functions that graduates can perform in Economics and Business 30 years after the adoption in 1977 of the royal decree that delimits the professional functions reserved for economists.
For its part, the Senate incorporated the creation of new figures in the financial sector, such as the mediator, who will work on behalf of others, will not require the authorization of the CNMV and will be able to provide its services of marketing products and attracting clients to different investment companies at the same time.
Harmonized CPI increases five-tenths in November, up 4.1%
This indicator, which is then used by Eurostat to include it in the calculation of the inflation rate in the European Union, provides an overview of how prices in Spain evolved during the month of November.
Its publication responds to the policy of Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB) to offer data comparable in time and quality to those produced in the United States.
The advanced indicator is calculated using the same procedure as the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices employee, but using various statistical modelling methods to estimate information not yet available at the time of publication.
The INE recalled that the information provided by the advance indicator is only indicative, so it does not necessarily have to coincide with the definitive data, which will be released on 14 December.
"The IPC will continue at relatively high levels"
Second vice president and economy minister Pedro Solbes said the 4.1% rise in the CPI in November was a “temporary figure,” but at the same time he hoped the price index would continue at “relatively high” levels in the coming months.
In any case, Solbes has pointed out in the halls of Congress that "although the figure is not good" Spain's inflation differential from the monetary union remains "more or less" the same of recent years.
He also explained that in November "there was less surprise" than in the previous month, when the government did not have such a high rise.
"We expected a figure of around 4%," the economy minister said in a statement.
Virgin plans to raise <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>42 billion with Northern Rock in three years
Northern Rock deposits have fallen more than 50% to <0xC2><0xA3>12 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>16.8 billion) since it went into crisis in mid-September and had to resort to an emergency loan from the Bank of England.
At the time, it was amassing record deposits in excess of <0xC2><0xA3>25 billion, a figure that has fallen progressively in two and a half months because of the mistrust of its customers and despite the government’s one hundred per cent guarantee of that money, which it will keep until the end of the crisis.
Virgin, which would rebrand the entity with its financial brand Virgin Money, needs to capture around a quarter of the income in British banks that are deposited over the next three years to achieve the remaining <0xC2><0xA3>18 billion until reaching the goal of <0xC2><0xA3>30 billion.
The group of the tycoon Richard Branson, known for its striking advertising campaigns in the UK, intends to spend 50 million pounds (about 70 million euros) annually on advertising and marketing to achieve its purpose.
Northern Rock this week named the Virgin consortium’s offer, in which three other companies participate, as their favorite to bail him out of bankruptcy.
Mayor of Totana arrested for alleged urban corruption plot
The Civil Guard has arrested today in the early morning the current mayor of the Murcian municipality of Totana (People's Party) for his alleged relationship with the plot of urban corruption uncovered this week.
In addition, one of the secretaries of the consistory and the chief of police of the municipality have also been arrested.
José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo last May replaced Juan Morales, current popular deputy, and until then councillor of the municipality, and that according to sources of research consulted by the SER Chain, could be the 'head' of this plot.
The agents continue to register the municipal offices and the City Planning Department and no further arrests are ruled out in the coming hours.
In addition, the lawyer of Juan Morales, the main suspect of the plot of urban corruption uncovered earlier this week, has been charged.
As yesterday reported by the SER Chain, the lawyer of the 'popular' deputy Juan Morales, therefore punched, was arrested leaving Morales' home with important documentation related to the plot.
Moreover, the object of the research, according to sources of the research, is the alleged collection of commissions from Morales in exchange for facilitating the signing of an urban agreement with a Galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of land.
So far, eight people have been arrested.
Bono agrees to lead the candidacy of the PSOE for Toledo and preside over the Congress if they win the elections.
Former Defense Minister José Bono has accepted the offer of the President of the Government and General Secretary of the Socialists, José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero, to head the PSOE list for Toledo for the next general election and to be President of Congress in the event that the Socialists win the general election.
This was announced at a press conference by the Secretary of Organization of the PSOE, José Blanco, and Bono himself, after the meeting that has held this noon at the federal headquarters of this party with Zapatero.
The chief executive has justified the offer to the former minister because "it is important to have the best" in political life and Bono "is among the best".
In addition, he noted that "it seems" that the Manchego politician will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside over the Congress if the socialists win in the next elections.
Bono would replace Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n as president of Congress, who made public on November 15 his decision not to run for the next general election and to abandon his career in active politics to devote himself to fighting climate change at the university level.
The former minister has acknowledged that the president of the government has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left it two years ago.
In addition, he noted that, just as citizens know who will be the economic vice president if the PSOE wins the election, his party has wanted to announce who will preside over the Congress, in an "act of transparency".
If he takes office, Bono hopes to turn the House into “the house of respect and not of insult or shouting” and make it “more and more like the citizens.”
"Sometimes, unfortunately, it seems that the only place in Madrid where you can't talk quietly and quietly is the Congress, the president of the government was interrupted in the Senate 26 times."
He has also had words of praise for his current president, Manuel Mar<0xC3><0xAD>n and "his good work" and did not want to be seen already occupying his position so as not to fall into what, he has pointed out, his opponents could see as "prepotence".
Climate Propaganda
As the climate change movement relentlessly pursues both the skeptics of its predictions and those prioritizing other political and social battles, it is bound to show iron coherence.
And more a leader of the movement that is president of the government as Zapatero and believes that this struggle is more important than that of Islamist terrorism and even proposes to sign a "new contract with the planet".
That approach forces him to explain why his government’s action, or inaction, has made a decisive contribution to Spain leading the EU in breach of Kyoto.
Who is responsible for the breach, in what sectors has occurred and why your Government, that of the contract with the planet, has not avoided it.
In addition, it demands that the Spanish explain with the utmost clarity what measures they are going to take to curb climate change.
What companies will be affected, what habits citizens will have to change, what individual and collective energy savings we will be forced to make, what economic consequences it will have.
In other words, who will sacrifice themselves and who will pay to save the planet.
But neither has there been nor will there be such explanations.
It’s because it’s about sacrificing and paying.
The measures against climate change, the real measures, are unpopular.
Costly, inconvenient and threatening to the accounts of companies and individuals.
Even one-cent of the gasoline suggested by the PSOE has seemed so dangerous electorally to Zapatero that he hastened to deny it.
That is, it is about saving the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slogans of any real consequence.
With impactful phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, that gentleman is so useful for election campaigns that he neither speaks nor denounces nor demands, but adorns the rallies and inspires tenderness.
As long as it is limited to being a purely virtual contracting party and does not pretend that we move by bike or cool off with the fan.
The mayor and the head of the local police of Totana arrested for an alleged plot of urban corruption
The Civil Guard has arrested the mayor of the Murcian town of Totana, the "popular" José Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretary of the City Council and a hotel entrepreneur for possible urban crimes, sources of the investigation have reported today.
The mayor was arrested at his home and has been transferred to the Consistory, in whose offices he is currently with numerous agents, who have also gone to the Department of Urbanism and the municipal company of management of the Industrial Land and Housing.
These three arrests are in addition to the six made last Monday in Galicia, Murcia and Madrid, in an operation related to the requalification of more than 2 million hectares of rustic land in urbanizable for the Galician company Nuaria to build 4,000 homes, after paying illegal commissions during the last legislature.
In addition, two other people were not arrested but are charged in the summary, which instructs the Court number 1 of Totana.
The first six detainees have now been placed on trial.
According to the sources, the former councilor of Totana and today autonomous parliamentarian of the PP, Juan Morales, is being investigated.
In addition, the former woman, owner of a real estate agency registered today in Totana, has been charged, as has the current girlfriend of the former councillor, who resides in Murcia capital.
The director and owner of Grupo Nuaria, the lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was arrested in Nigr<0xC3><0xA1>n (Pontevedra), as was Pablo José M.G., director of Soil of Inmonuar, an agency integrated in the aforementioned Group, through which the bribes would have been made.
The investigation is carried out by the Civil Guard’s Central Operating Unit (UCO) Group of Urban Crimes, whose agents, in addition to the arrests, practiced eleven registrations, most of them in companies related to the detainees and located in Madrid, Vigo, Murcia, Pontevedra, Las Rozas (Madrid) and Totana.
Only one person was then arrested in Totana, in particular, the owner of a well-known poultry company in the region, which could have acted as an intermediary.
Grupo Nuaria was in charge of developing what would be the largest residential complex in the Murcian municipality of Totana, which would involve the construction of more than 5,000 homes, a golf course and two hotels with "spa".
The company acquired 2.2 million square meters of land in Totana that were requalified and its project would double the population of the municipality, which has 25,000 inhabitants.
The Nuaria Group integrates companies such as Autesa and Inomonuar, dedicated to real estate promotion; Conycase, which manages the car parks of the streets of A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, Venezuela and Plaza de Fernando el Cat<0xC3><0xB3>lico; Hogartel, dedicated to the direct marketing sector; Preconiza, focused on the promotion, sale and installation of construction elements.

Our Finnish correspondent provides us with this comment yesterday in the most important newspaper in Finland (by the way at the head of the PISA report on educational level in the world), Helsingin Sanomat, which refers to what they published on November 18, the same day that there appeared, curiously, the criticism of Blackburn's book:
“The content of the Philosophical signature has jumped into public view as a result of the tragedy of Jokela’s school.
The culprit of the deaths, a high school student, quoted in his messages the works of Plato and Nietzsche.
The Education Counselor in charge of the Philosophy subject, Pekka Elo, demanded from the pages of the Helsingin Sanomat newspaper that teachers adopt a critical attitude towards Plato and stated that studying Nietzsche is not essential in the compulsory basic course of Philosophy in the institutes.

A colleague passes information on the introduction of Internet download crimes in the Criminal Code:
A. Downloading a song would be a crime with a penalty of six months to a year.
On the other hand, if you steal in the store discs worth less than 400 euros, it is considered simply missing (Article 623.1).
B. If you steal in the store up to 1,000 euros, the theft is already a crime, but the penalty remains lower than the one imposed on the download (article 234 of the Criminal Code).
C. If you steal a car and return it 40 hours later, the penalty is still less than the discharge (article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to engage in a fight than to engage in the exchange of compacts.
Participating in a tumultuous quarrel is punishable by three months to one year (article 154 of the Criminal Code) and the exchange would be punishable by six months to two years.
(Article 270 of the Criminal Code).
E. Sexual harassment at work is considered less serious than downloading a movie on DVD, according to article 184.2 of the Criminal Code.
F. The distribution of copyrighted and unauthorized films is more punishable than the distribution of pornographic material to minors (art. 186).
Anyway, if my colleague is right, someone is getting their hands off, a very long hand.

My doctor-in-chief gives me one of his articles on rare research entitled: ‘Money produces brain activations, especially if others receive less’.
That is, the feelings generated by the monthly wage of the workers depend on what the colleagues earn.
The study has been conducted using tomographic magnetic resonance imaging at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the latest issue of Science.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Imaging group at the Life&Brain Institute in Germany: “The strongest activation occurred when the participant responded correctly and their partner failed.”
The researchers observed that if when they both got the same pay, the activation was moderate, but if one got double, the activation was higher.
I don’t know if I needed that much science.
The Prosecutor of the Balkans
Carla del Ponte has spent eight years relentlessly persecuting war criminals in the Balkans from the prosecutor’s office of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in The Hague.
His term ends at the end of the year and Carla will leave with a bittersweet taste, because the main perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre - in which 8,000 Bosnian Muslims died -, former General Ratko Mladic and former Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, are still at large.
Their names are in that list from which takes its title the documentary of the Swiss director Marcel Sch<0xC3><0xBC>pbach, 'La lista de Carla' (2006, not premiered in Spain) that, with the rhythm of a police thriller, follows the work of the Swiss prosecutor from Belgrade to New York to persecute the fugitive criminals and pressure the governments involved to tighten the siege.
Which insurance is right for me?
Car insurance, which covers the driver in the event of possible accidents, represents an important expense that will depend on various factors, such as age, sex, age of the car, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use of it, among others.
Having a car is just the beginning.
And that is, choosing the right car insurance is even more difficult than choosing the vehicle model.
First of all, we need to be clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between an insurance company and the insured.
This commitment is embodied in an insurance contract, which states that the company receives the value of the agreed premium in exchange for being responsible for the obligation to pay compensation in the event of a claim.
The premium is the price of the insurance, which is established taking into account various factors, such as age, sex, age of the card, marital status, the type of vehicle to be insured or the use that is given to it, among others.
Insurance companies set their prices based on statistics, so the more likely they are to suffer an accident, the higher the fee to pay.
It is for this reason that both older than 25 and women have to pay lower premiums, as statistics reflect that they have a lower casualty rate due to their prudence.
Also, by looking at the numbers, the companies have come to the conclusion that married people tend to have fewer accidents than single drivers.
The use that is given to the vehicle will influence the frequency, and thus the likelihood of having some sort of perchance.
As the frequency increases, the odds increase.
There are many variables that insurers take into account when setting the premium price.
That is why the driver has to study the situation well to choose the car insurance that best fits his profile.
We will show here the most significant variables when choosing one or another type of insurance, so that this, in addition to adapting to the characteristics of the insured, offers you a reasonable price.
Young people under the age of 25 face various disadvantages when it comes to taking out insurance at an affordable price, such as reduced driving experience and the age of the ticket.
Although the ideal thing to be well insured is all-risk insurance, there are other more economical options.
The most cautious drivers can opt for an all-risk franchise, so they get insurance coverage at all-risk but at a more feasible price.
This kind of agreement would mean that the customer pays a part of the amount of the claim.
"The part of the amount of the claim provided by the customer will be pre-set based on the value of the premium, which will be higher the lower the amount," said Luis Noguera, chief executive in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is extended third-party insurance, so that the customer ensures protection against damage caused to third parties, although not against those caused in his own car.
In addition, it would be covered by theft, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A piece of advice.
If you are under 25 try to be careful and avoid damages as much as possible, as this will affect the bonus, and may reduce the cost of insurance in the future.
A bonus is a reduction on the base rate the company owns.
On the contrary, a penalty is a surcharge on such a base rate.
“Bonuses and penalties will depend on the company and its profit.
If the company has had a good year it will be able to afford to increase bonuses,” Noguera explains.
After the age of 25, drivers find it easier to take out insurance, since the accident rate is reduced thanks to the accumulated experience.
For this reason, the most recommended thing is to hire a full risk with a franchise.
“Normally young people cannot make use of the experience previously gained in the time of an accident, and even in the time of driving,” says the director in Spain of the European company, adding that most accidents occur in the second year of driving, once the ‘fear of the novice’ has passed.
However, if the client is married but does not yet have children it is preferable that he negotiates insurance at all risk, as long as his financial situation allows, of course.
For their part, marriages with children are considered by insurers as the public with the lowest casualty rate, so the surcharges will be lower.
In this case, the best insurance would be one at all risk with a deductible (it can be 300 euros), or, when there is a high level of bonus, one extended to third parties from the third year of life of the vehicle.
“They conduct more relaxed driving and have greater purchasing power to afford the luxury of taking on a greater amount of franchise,” Luis Noguera said.
For retirees, it is advisable to take out an all-risk insurance with a deductible (this being 150 euros), or one extended to third parties when you have a high level of bonus.
It must be said that car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the driver in the event of possible damages, but also because it represents an important expense, which is why it is essential to properly study the insurance that suits us best according to our personal situation.
The Celtic are looking for a point in Milan that is worth the eighth
Milan and Celtic meet on Tuesday in San Siro in search of the missing point to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the ligature of the 'Champions', as the Italians serve to be first and the Scots to decide their classification.
The Italians add ten points and have already certified on the fifth day their pass with a draw in Portugal, while Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to make sure the Shakhtar, with six, and who receives Benfica, who has four, does not go ahead.
These two Group D matches will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan have to compete in the Club World Cup in Japan, where they debut on the 13th in the semifinals in search of a place for the 16th.
Thus, this group will be closed before the rest and the draw in the Giuseppe Meazza seems the most expected result, although the two teams will try to go out for a victory, since the Italians will not want to speculate at home and Celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossing in octaves.
Gordon Strachan's set could even serve a defeat to qualify if the Shakhtar doesn't win, but he can't be trusted because at nine-point parity the pass is for the Ukrainians, who lost last week in Glasgow (2-1), but won (2-0) in the other straight match.
Thus, the Milanists will try to sour the night to the Scots, who trust to get into eighth for the second time in the restructured Champions League and consecutively, after they were precisely defeated in that round last season with a goal of Kaka in the extension (1-0) after the 0-0 of the trip.
Waiting for the victory of the 'rossoneri' will be the Shakhtar who only deserves the victory, in case he loses the Celtic, both to get into the eighth and to continue in UEFA.
And it is that Benfica, despite being last and without options to continue in the top European competition, could reach third place with a victory, with which UEFA would play.
20,000 people attend the first concert of the Spice Girls tour in Vancouver
The Spice Girls have started their first tour since disbanding in 2000 in Vancouver, Canada, in front of some 20,000 spectators.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Melanie Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared shortly before starting their gig at Vancouver's GM Place Stadium that the group's reunion is "british".
Around 20,000 people sold out to attend the concert which included a video telling the story of the group that raged in the late 1990s.
The reunion and the world tour coincide with the release of a new album that collects his main hits as well as two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Voodoo', which in Spain publishes EMI.
The five Spice Girls went on stage wearing bracelets given to them by Posh Spice’s husband, British footballer David Beckham.
The athlete was among the crowd thronging the GM Place, even though Victoria's nerves had banned him days earlier.
In advance of the start of the show, Victoria Beckham noted that the British star "has not seen our costumes at all, so I'm nervous about what you're going to think of the show."
'Sporty Spice' whose departure from the group in 1998 "because of the differences between us" caused the quintet's dissolution two years later, also expressed his nervousness during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the show.
“I was scared.
I was nervous but I saw that the feeling of the world has changed, the feeling of the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I’m glad I made the decision,” Chisholm said of the group meeting she disbanded nine years ago.
The singer also noted that over time, "things have settled and we love each other very much."
But a lot has changed since the Spice Girls last performed together in 1998.
For starters, according to CTV television, the group arrived in Vancouver on a special Virgin Airlines plane.
Upon their arrival at the airport, an army of nannies was waiting for them.
There are seven children among the five.
Following the Vancouver concert, the group will perform in California (USA), San Jose (December 4th) and Los Angeles (December 5th and 7th).
They will perform in Madrid on December 23.
New fears about gas between Russia and Ukraine
The growing dispute over the price of gas between Ukraine and Russia increases the risk that it will affect Russia’s export of fuel to Western Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so every friction between the two nations is a source of attention.
Kiev has warned that if Moscow increases the price of gas, Russia will have to pay higher transit rates.
A previous dispute last year reduced supplies to EU states.
The latest dispute between Kiev and Moscow came with the Ukrainian government and the Russian state, the monopoly owner of gas, Gazprom, trying to agree on the amount of money that Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom said it would charge Ukraine more, as it has pledged to pay an extra 50 percent in 2008 for gas coming from neighboring Turkmenistan.
Analysts say it could be that Ukraine will pay 40% more for Gazprom’s imports.
"It is important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important transits for gas during the talks," Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh told Reuters news agency.
“Changes in gas prices should not be related to our arguments about the levels of transit rates [to Western Europe] via Ukraine.”
The last major gas dispute between Moscow and Kiev, Gazprom cut off supplies to Ukraine in January 2006.
This meant a drop in exports to Western Europe, which quickly raised prices.
Russian gas accounts for a quarter of the EU’s supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves in the world, but much of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own gas supply from Turkmenistan and other former Soviet Central Asian nations.
The NHS “will have to test foreign workers”
The Scottish NHS needs to monitor criminal records of employees from outside Europe, one watchdog said.
Auditor General Robert Black’s recommendation came after it was found that a foreign doctor was linked to the Glasgow airport attack in June.
Black also expressed concern that the Scottish NHS has no exact idea how many foreign staff it has.
However, his report noted other checks that are carried out correctly through a sample of five health authorities.
The Auditor General checked the number of foreign staff hired outside the European Economic Area in the wake of the Glasgow airport attacks.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor at Paisley’s Royal Alexandra Hospital, was arrested at the airport after crashing a jeep into the doors of the airport terminal building.
He was one of three doctors who performed at the Old Bailey by video conference in October, charged in connection with the alleged car bomb attacks in the UK.
The NHS hopes to conduct pre-employment checks on candidates, to make sure they meet the qualifications, experience and authorization to work in the UK.
Although the Scottish Health Board uses "Disclosure Scotland" to conduct criminal background checks, the agency has no jurisdiction to obtain this information outside of Britain.
The Auditor General’s report recommends, among other measures, that boards should be guided by the Criminal Records Bureau, which helps employers with criminal controls in many countries outside Britain.
“Although we found some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a routine review,” the report says.
Black states that the Scottish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that: “Our report highlights areas that can be improved to ensure that the necessary information is available in the number of NHS foreign staff.”
Scottish BMA president Dr Peter Terry said it was “very unlikely” that pre-employment checks could identify potential NHS employees who could commit terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that pre-employment checks work at NHS Scotland but it is not clear what the added value of the recommendations made is," he explained.
Scottish health authorities say they currently have 1,161 foreign people, most of them doctors and nurses.
But the auditor general warned that the number may be higher, in part because boards have trouble identifying which employees have indefinite residence permits.
The investigation also found that the verification procedures established by the NHS authorities in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were being widely complied with.
This includes passport checks, work permit and qualification check.
The Scottish government is currently reviewing the policy and guidance of pre-employment of foreigners in the NHS.
Health Secretary Nicola Sturgeon said: “It was of great interest that this work be carried out in the wake of the Glasgow Airport terrorist attack.
He added that the Scottish government, in conjunction with health boards, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this will be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guidelines for all working groups – including foreigners – which they planned to publish next month.
Joy Division dominates film awards
Control, the biographical film about late Joy Division vocalist Ian Curtis, has won five awards at the British Independent Film Festival, including the award for Best Picture.
The trophies were also given to protagonist Sam Riley, who worked in a warehouse until he was chosen for the role of Curtis, for director Anton Corbijn and co-star Toby Kebbell.
Actress Judi Dench was named best actress by the thriller "Notes of a Scandal".
And Bond star Daniel Craig won the variety award for putting a British film on the international stage.
The awards were presented at a ceremony at the Roundhouse in London.
Control follows Curtis' rise to fame with Joy Division, until his suicide in 1980, at the age of 23.
The film – in black and white – featuring soundtracks by The Killers, David Bowie and New Order – was produced for just <0xC2><0xA3>3,000.
But the Dutch photographer Corbijn, already known for the iconic cover of U2’s Joshua Tree album, won two awards – for best director and best debut director.
Rock music was the center of another award-winning ceremony—like Julien Temple’s film about The Clash vocalist Joe Strummer, which won the award for best documentary.
The Best Actor award went to Viggo Mortensen for his role as a driver for a Russian mafia boss in the David Cronenberg film Eastern Promises.
Ray Winstone, who has a reputation for playing hard, received the Richard Jarris Award for his contribution to British cinema.
The 50-year-old, whose films include Scum, Nil By Mouth and Sexy Beast, is currently filming the Indiana Jones sequel "The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull".
Winstone said he was proud to receive that award, named in honor of Harris, star of Camelot and Harry Potter, who died in 2002.
“It was people like Richard Harris and Albert Finney who opened doors for people like me,” he said.
“I was lucky to meet Richard Harris a couple of times.
He was a great guy, a great actor of our time, he’s really an honor.”
The independent film awards, known as BIFAS, are selected by a team that includes filmmakers, actors and festival organizers.
Bifa festival supporters and patrons include Mike Figgis, Ken Loach, Ewan McGregor, Samantha Morton, Bill Nighy, Meera Syal and Michael Winterbottom.
Saudi Arabia arrests 208 terrorists
Saudi Arabia says it has arrested 208 terrorist cell militants who were planning an imminent attack on oil facilities, as well as attacks on religious and security forces.
State television of the world’s largest oil supplier said one of the cells was planning to smuggle missiles.
Al-Qaeda sympathizers have mounted a campaign against the local monarchy, in alliance with the United States, since 2003 following the invasion of Iraq.
A cell of eight militants made up of foreign residents was planning an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province, the television report said.
Saudi Arabia created a 35,000-strong force to protect the facilities of Abqaiq, the world’s largest oil plant, after a failed al-Qaeda attack in 2006.
The report, citing a statement by the Saudi Interior Minister, said 18 of those arrested belonged to a cell led by a “missile launcher expert” who has entered the country.
The minister said the militants had planned to smuggle eight projectiles into the country.
Another 22 of the detainees were planning killings of religious leaders and security forces.
The government warned religious leaders that they must be more active in stopping Saudis traveling to Iraq from joining al-Qaeda as militants in fighting allied forces and backing the Shiite Muslim government, which is considered heretical by the most extreme Saudi Sunnis.
Al-Qaeda militants are targeting many religious in Saudi Arabia who have been appointed by the authorities to support the policies of the royal family, which dominates the government.
The militants – recruited by the calls of Osama Bin Laden, the Saudi-born al Qaeda leader, to harass the country’s pro-Western government – targeted government-associated foreign residences, government buildings and energy facilities.
"This was a great effort by the security forces, since five months of work," the interior minister's spokesman told state television.
The arrested also include a 16-person "media cell" in Medina, whose goal was to promote "takfiri thought" - the ideology of radical Sunni Muslims who support violence against Muslims considered infidels and apostates.
The arrest includes 32 other people accused of providing financial support to the militants.
Venus climate can give an idea of the future of Earth
Venus may have once been a suitable place for life, scientists said yesterday.
Data from an orbiting European spacecraft showed the planet more like an Earth twin than had previously been observed.
Venus is the closest planet to Earth.
The two planets are similar in size and occupy similar orbits, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
Millions of years ago, Venus may have had conditions similar to those that made Earth a habitable planet, scientists now believe.
But the effects of carbon dioxide and the greenhouse effect, atmospheric erosion by solar radiation and slower solar rotation sent Venus into a very different kind of development.
Today the planet has no water, the surface temperature is enough to melt lead and is eroded by hurricane winds and lightning storms.
The results of the European Space Agency for the Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offers an overview of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes due to climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physics at the University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, says: “It is becoming clear why the climate on Venus is so different from that on Earth, when they are two planets so similar.
“Our new data makes it possible to build a scenario where Venus started out as Earth, possibly with a habitable environment millions of years ago.”
Police decommission "enriched uranium"
A kilo of radioactive material, which they claim is enriched uranium, was seized yesterday by Slovak and Hungarian police.
A police spokesman said three people were arrested and the material was examined.
The cash could not confirm whether it was enriched uranium but said it could have been sold for $1 million (<0xC2><0xA3>480,000).
It still remains open
Mitt Romney says it’s not worthy for presidential candidates to answer the questions of a snow ape.
However, Republican presidential candidates eventually agree to hold a debate on YouTube, in which ordinary voters record questions on video and send them for dissemination among the candidates.
None of the questions posed on Wednesday afternoon were more ridiculous than that of the snow ape who asked Democrats about climate warming in the YouTube Republican Party debate.
But the questions, and the answers, this time reflected much of the state of the Republican party in the run-up to next year’s election.
It is not known exactly how the CNN producers, who co-sponsored the debate, chose YouTube videos to show candidates to applicants.
But the first half hour of debate, the longest devoted to a single topic, focused on immigration.
The topic is one of the most powerful topics for Republicans.
CNN asked a group of undecided voters to raise the dial when they heard ideas they liked: the broadcasters noticed peaks of approval when candidates spoke with extremist arguments.
The hardest word exchanges of the night were between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, who has been a trailblazer in the crucial Iowa and New Hampshire polls.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to ruin Romney’s reputation because he was soft on illegal immigration when he was mayor of New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accusing the former Massachusetts governor of hiring illegal immigrants to work in his home.
Both responded aggressively when asked if a candidate could support an “amnesty” (allowing illegals to regularize their situation and giving them the chance to obtain citizenship).
Minor candidates such as Duncan Hunter, a California congressman, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado congressman, reached agreement on the issue.
No one has the word of being a nominee, but both remain in the race perhaps because both warned about the issue of immigration before the others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased border surveillance, intolerance of illegal immigrants.
This topic, along with fear of China’s toxic toys and other concerns abroad, helps Republicans forget about, or minimize, the divisions between liberals and Christian conservatives.
But the debate turned into uncomfortable when other topics appeared.
Mr. Giuliani was asked why he had supported gun control in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney debated whether water immersion should be considered torture.
One person asked if the candidates believed every word of the Bible.
This led Mr. Giuliani to stumble into the position that while the Bible was his favorite book, he did not literally believe in the story of Jonah and the whale.
Another person asked if Jesus would support the death penalty.
Mike Huckabee – now against all odds, first in Iowa’s most recent poll, thanks to his long-standing Christian conservatism – said the death penalty was painful but necessary.
When pressured to answer whether Jesus would be in favor, he laughed saying that Jesus was too smart to be a candidate in the elections.
The race is still unusually open.
Mr. Huckabee is on the rise in Iowa, coinciding with liberal Ron Paul’s fundraising campaigns, and his heated statements from Wednesday’s debate.
The two have come out from the bottom, because the two wings of the party did not come to an agreement on the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the party early and convincingly with a winning message about the greatness of America, satisfying both wings of the party.
This time the match is split and the result is far from clear.
Dolores Laboristas
Gordon Brown has discovered another hole in which to sink; but it also emerges
As political scandals continue in England, this one is not particularly interesting.
They don’t seem to have sold influences, nor are they exorbitant hotel accounts in Paris, nor are they sucked by extramarital fingers.
But it has been revealed that a wealthy businessman has disguised contributions to the English Labour government party, worth more than <0xC2><0xA3>650,000 ($1.3 million), for nearly four years using false names, and that the party did not denounce him.
Two months ago, when the prime minister evaded calling an election, foolishly insulting British intelligence by declaring that opinion polls did not influence his decision, the hope was that it would provide a strong and efficient government.
But instead, like Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat leads with increasing ingenuity, because the dreaded Mr. Brown has gone from being Stalin to being Mr. Bean.
The bailout of Northern Rock, a troubled bank, demonstrated regulatory weakness and poverty of judgment in times of crisis.
Poor proposals to change the tax code have pitted business groups, together, against the government.
The tax authority lost 25 million personal data that revealed an unimaginable administrative lapse.
A trio of retired generals began a riot in the House of Lords, protesting against cuts in military spending: being ministers of the armed forces is, they claimed, a part-time job.
Now it is the multiple donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the Labour secretary general (and former accomplice) has already resigned.
None of this means that Mr. Brown walks irrevocably towards the exit.
Governments can reach a turning point after they find themselves unable to govern.
People don’t believe them as politicians, but they usually suspend their disbelief when a new batch takes over.
Once it is clear that the prime minister cannot improve things, that he does not have much time left, that suspension is too much: public officials begin to fail; cabinet ministers are exposed; the press is looking for bad news; and the government gets defensive and does not focus.
On the one hand, Brown’s position is particularly difficult, because unlike other political leaders he cannot defend himself by arguing that it is new.
Although I would like to disown Tony Blair, he was his lieutenant-colonel.
The Northern Rock problems and the authority registration tax are related to the decisions Brown made as chancellor of the treasury.
And even though it’s not directly involved in Blairish setbacks — or “effective for partners,” research funding political parties — voters can assume it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not as bad as it seems.
The plates are not as bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, no one has died or been directly scammed.
And the remedy, though painful, is to give what Mr. Brown’s naturally Stalinist tendencies have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new political scandal of donations is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares his donations to charitable gifts, says he does not want public recognition for his benevolence.
This may be the case, but the decision is not his.
The anti-anonymity laws for big political taxpayers are clear and there is a clear reason: the public has a right to know who is buying access to those in power.
Mr. Watt, who said he knew about Mr. Abraham's deal, and that it was not illegal, will obviously face Jon Mendlesohn, the fundraiser chief who was asked about the donations in October.
But Mr. Brown is so far uninvolved: there is nothing to suggest that he knew of these performances, although the bulk of the payments were made after he took control of the office in June.
So far, the prime minister has done half the work.
He has been quick to condemn his party for breaking the law, but is diluting himself in decision-making over a family matter, a commission of inquiry into the matter—led, to a large extent, by a judge and a bishop.
In this case, the morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a matter for the police.
In addition, there are other things that Mr. Brown must do, such as finding a permanent and independent head for the Public Life Standards Commission, since he has not had one for six months, and he must also push for a genuine reform of party funding.
This will require arduous cooperative work by the Labour with the Tories, and perhaps a renunciation of the special financial situation with the unions – bitter measures for a partisan like Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partisan facts.
The Conservatives now have a good level of support in the polls; he has two years to win voters; and the only way he can move to victory is to act with impeccable probity and solid competition.
Sharks cards
The subprime mortgage crisis is infecting the U.S. credit card market?
When there is blood in the water, it is natural for dorsal fins to swim excitedly around.
Today, as the U.S. housing market is in crisis, predators have their sights set on the country’s credit card market.
Analysts at Goldman Sachs estimate that credit card losses could reach $99 million if the subprime mortgage crisis infects other forms of consumer credit.
Signs of infection are already visible.
There is an increase in both card charges and crime rates, which measures the proportion of balances that have not been amortized or that are more than 30 days late respectively.
HSBC announced last month that it has taken 1.4 million charge in its U.S. consumer finance business, in part due to the weakness of card borrowers.
However, it is too early for panic.
Delay and crime are at low levels.
According to Moody’s, a rating agency, in the third quarter the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point below the historical average.
The deterioration in rates can be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the U.S. Bankruptcy Act (2005) resulted in a sharp drop in bankruptcy applications, which in turn represent a large credit card loss; the number of applications (and therefore of lateness) would be growing again, or it may happen that conditions for borrowers were worsening.
The industry also reports solid payment rates, which show how much of its debt consumers pay each month.
And the reliance on credit cards and asset-backed securities is fairly firm, despite paralysis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney of TowerGroup, a research firm, predicts that emissions for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct channels of crisis infection between subprime mortgages and the credit card market certainly exist: consumers like to charge debts to credit cards now that credit institutions are phasing out.
But credit card issuers look more at the flow of liquidity than asset values, so falling prices don’t necessarily drive a change in borrowers’ creditworthiness.
They can even work to outsmart the emitters.
Incentives for consumers to keep amortizing the mortgage decreases if the properties are worth less than the loan value; and as a result, payment of the card debt goes up the priority list.
Card issuers can also respond quickly and flexibly to the difficult conditions that mortgage lenders face, changing interest rates or altering creditor balances.
That should, in theory, reduce the risk of a rapid asset freeze.
“We’re not going to wake up one day and reassess all the loans,” says Gary Perlin, chief financial officer of Capital One.
If a sudden subprime infection in the credit card market is unlikely, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If house prices are lower and a credit crunch pushes America into recession, the industry is undoubtedly facing a more severe future.
We need to keep an eye on those dorsal fins.
British bankers found guilty in Enron case
Three British bankers who went on trial for their responsibility in the frauds with Enron’s former chief financial officer, Andrew Fastow, were found guilty on Wednesday.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found innocent of seven counts of fraud for colluding with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich themselves at the expense of employees.
They were sent to trial in January.
But during the hearing before U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein Jr., each was convicted of collusion in fraud.
The three former executives of Greenwich Natwest, a unit of the Scottish group PLC at the Royal Bank, became notorious in Britain for extradition proceedings that lasted two years.
In the United States, his case marks the sluggish end of an investigation launched after the Enron collapse in 2001.
Initially, the charges against the bankers were to have alerted Fastow in 2002 that he was the target of a government investigation into Enron's downfall.
The indictment against the bankers - dubbed the "NatWest Three" - alleges that they came to Houston in 2000 to invent a fraudulent scheme with Fastow and his former senior aide, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an Enron corporation controlled by Fastow, who was the mastermind of a myriad of Enron frauds, which helped his spiral into bankruptcy.
In 2002, the bank valued the subsidiary's interest at zero, but the three Britons knew it would rise.
A company under Kopper’s control bought the subsidiary’s bank interest at $1 million.
The bankers paid Kopper $250,000 for interest in the company.
According to the indictment, Fastow falsely represented Enron, as the energy company would pay Greenwich NatWest $20 million for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in the hands of the British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers collected $7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received about $12.3 million, according to the indictment.
In January 2004, Fastow was convicted on two counts of conspiracy in the Enron collapse.
The trio of Britons were arrested three months later.
Fastow is serving a six-year sentence in a Louisiana federal prison.
Kopper is serving a three-year and one-month sentence in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers must pay the $1 million they required to live in the United States while the trial was being held.
Enron, one of the nation’s seven largest companies, declared bankrupt in December 2001 after years of accounting tricks, could not hide the debt of millions or make their failing businesses look successful.
The collapse led to the loss of thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
Enron founder Kenneth Lay and previous chief executive Jeffrey Skilling were indicted last year for their roles in the company's collapse.
Skilling is serving a sentence of more than 24 years.
Lay’s conviction for conspiracy, fraud and other charges was suspended when she died of a heart attack last year.
Neither down nor out in Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 aircraft, equipped with a Rolls-Royce engine and sufficient fuel capacity to fly direct from Moscow to Los Angeles, starts at $54 million dollars.
But this is a small expense for some of the rich Russians.
“It has a capacity of up to 18 passengers,” says Dan Firer, a Gulfstream representative.
“But no one asks for that model of so many seats because it’s for family private flights or for company presidents.”
Mr. Firer was in charge of the Gulfstream booth last Friday at the Millionaire’s Fair, a four-day consumer orgy held at an event center near the capital.
In addition to Gulfstream, 200 other luxury suppliers had installed their exhibition stands, hoping to attract the new wealthy Russians to all kinds of products, from mahogany-crafted yachts to diamond-embedded car grills, worth 50 cents.
Mr. Firer looks carefully at a bright orange Porsche in the stand next to his."
“It’s a nice car, but it’s nickel and cauldron compared to us,” he said.
“After the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private jets.”
Fueled by the boom in oil, the Russian capital looks like Dallas when it was at its peak.
“We lived the same way in 1890, when some wealthy Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists,” says Marshall Goldman, a senior professor at the Davis Center for Russian and Eurasian Studies at Harvard University.
“Like the Saudis of the 1970s and the Japanese of the 1990s, the Russians are emerging as the world’s biggest consumers and spenders.”
The world’s most exclusive luxury brands are looking for their share of the cake.
Elsewhere in Moscow, a conference on the luxury industry will be held this week with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, the president of LVMH, to exchange ideas on how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, owned by the New York Times)
Russia has 53 billionaires making a total of $282 billion, according to the Forbes list of the richest people.
In addition, the second-grade rich include 103,000 Russian millionaires whose money reaches $670 billion, according to a study of the evolution of personal wealth in the former Soviet Union, written by economists at the Center for Economic and Financial Research, a local think-thank.
(The World Bank says that in 2005, 15.8% of Russians were below the subsistence level.)
"There are hundreds of millionaires in Moscow - and that's why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, sales and marketing representative for David Morris, the London jeweller.
She attends the fair for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
“Women are flawlessly prepared and men are very worthy.”
Visiting the fair on Sunday night, dressed in an evening suit, two real estate agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their clients and themselves as millionaires.
“I was looking at the cars and I’m trying to decide between the Infiniti, Mercedes and Porsche,” said Yumatova, who reeled off the design suit she wore as a network carpet veteran dishing with Joan Rivers.
The fair aims to attract the new rich, the type of buyers who would be willing to stay several hours in a warehouse that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, platinum feather cutters, M<0xC3><0xB6>venpick ice cream, custom pool tables, apartments in Dubai and Teddy Bears from Gund.
The general public can buy tickets for 30 euros ($44.57 USD).
“The Russians are interested in learning which brand is the most expensive and the best,” said Mr. Gijrath, who sat patriotically at a stand of Dutch royal Delft porcelains, in front of a mural-sized reconstruction of a Rembrandt painting, made of hand-painted tiles.
"Of course, the Russians are more interested in bling-bling.
In fact, sellers said that the wealthiest Russians (10 to 15 years, by Russian standards) have changed their tastes from eye-catching logos to limited-edition brands, which would not be on display at a trade fair.
However, several thousand people: millionaires in cash, emissaries of millionaires or tourists, fill the corridors every day.
And some of them buy.
On the first night of the fair last Thursday, Roman Ershov, general manager of King Koil beds, said he sold two $70,000-dollar mattress systems each, made of silk, cashmere and cotton interwoven with gold threads.
Also on the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales manager for A1 Moto, a company that equips high-end cars with ad hoc alarm systems, said the company had sold the bright orange Porsche for $170,000 to a Russian millionaire.
On Sunday afternoon, Andrei Karapetian, president of L.A. Connection, a company that modifies luxury cars for particular requirements, said he had sold three chain bracelet-shaped car grilles, for Rolls Royce Phantom, for $55,000 each.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with rays embedded with Swarovski colored crystals, so that it resembled a roulette wheel.
The cost: $22,000 for four wheels.
“The Russian millionaire who wants ostrich leather wheels or a portrait of his wife made of zirconium cubes is not necessarily going to drive on those wheels,” says Mr. Karapetian.
“He’s going to keep the car in his garage, along with another 30 or 40 cars.”
Even if many of his Russian clients are wealthy, Mr. Karapetian clarifies that the phrase “Russian millionaire” does not mean exclusivity, given the surge in real estate prices.
“If you bought an apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, you’re probably already a millionaire, at least on paper if it’s not in cash,” he said.
“There are more of them than you think.”
Those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be wealthy by the support of the Continental Alliance, a Russian asset management firm.
The company made four red (British-style) phone booths filled with $1 million fake banknote stacks.
Azad Karryev, the company’s marketing manager, said his team had printed 500,000 fake tickets for the Millionaire Fair.
Visitors stopped to shake up piles of money, asking their friends to take pictures with their mobile phones while resting on piles of money, or pocketing a couple of millions.
“You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a millionaire,” says Karryev.
‘Snapshot’ Surgery Could Cause Death in New Jersey
It was the day before Thanksgiving when Ronald Livingston looked through the “A Little Healthier” restaurant window and saw an ambulance go up White Cape Cod, two doors down West Scott Avenue.
Suddenly, a police car appeared.
And then another.
"Then I saw the ambulance go up," said Mr. Livingston, the restaurant's supervisor, that day Wednesday.
"That's when I knew someone had died."
Authorities learned that the dead woman was 41-year-old Olga Arroyo, assistant director of the Newark police department.
Investigators are now trying to determine if she died due to a procedure performed by an unauthorized plastic surgeon, who is not yet identified by police, but who works at 212 West Scott Ave.
The authorities have not yet determined what caused Ms. Arroyo's death, but they are awaiting the toxicology test, although the results will not be available for a few weeks, which will help solve the mysterious death that has plagued the top ranks of the Newark police.
Ms. Arroyo had been an assistant to the police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and her voice was familiar to many in the department.
“She was loyal, hardworking and tenacious,” Mr. McCarthy says of Arroyo in a phone interview Wednesday.
"She was my guardian."
She was protecting me.”
Mr. McCarthy said Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former Newark police officer who works for the Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission, and who left two children aged 14 and 11, and a stepdaughter.
Eileen Walsh, a spokesman for County Attorney Theodore J. Romankow, said detectives are trying to determine whether Ms. Arroyo died as a result of an unauthorized surgical procedure.
"That's one of the possibilities," Walsh said.
"It's an ongoing investigation."
Authorities said they arrived at the house about 3 P.M.
On November 21, they found Mrs. Arroyo on a sofa.
She was pronounced dead at the scene.
It has been more than a week and authorities have said little about their investigation or about the owner of the house, called Flor Margarita Castro.
Ms. Walsh could not say whether Ms. Castro has been questioned by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine which part of the house was used as a medical consultation.
On Wednesday, no one responded to the door at Mrs. Castro’s home, where a scarlet rose is located at the front of the house, and a Dalmatian robber at the back.
A blue drum labeled “vainillin ethyl” – used as a substitute for vanilla in food and perfumes – was found in the garage door, next to a door leading to the basement.
Two mountain bikes hang from hooks on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when she arrived in Newark after 25 years in the New York police department, Mrs. Arroyo was invaluable in helping to get to know the new island city and its rugged political culture.
“She would say, ‘You have to watch out for this one or that one,’” he said.
“She was always here when I was, and also when I wasn’t.
It's embarrassing."
The Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates to raise the stock market
Shares jumped on both sides of the Atlantic yesterday after the market expected the Federal Reserve to ease credit conditions with interest rate cuts, which increased with reassuring comments from the vice president of the U.S. central bank.
Stock markets were slumped in London, New York and across Europe after Donald Kohn, number two to Ben Bernanke, chairman of the reserve, declared that policymakers should be “flexible and pragmatic” in responding to the continued strain of financial markets.
In a clear effort to reassure markets amid growing samples of credit exchanges, Mr Kohn said the recent turbulence was "partly reversed by market improvement in late September and during October."
If the upward trend persists, it would increase the possibility of further adjustments in financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
The comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reserve is ready to inject fresh capital into U.S. markets and to make further interest rate cuts, to stabilize credit conditions.
Observations also helped calm Wall Street amid bad news for the U.S. economy, such as home sales that hit the lowest record in October.
The consequences of the financial turmoil were accentuated by a warning from Bear Stearns, an investment bank that will cut 650 jobs, equivalent to 4% of its total workforce, in a global cost reduction to offset losses from its investments in U.S. sub-prime mortgages.
Only 20 of those jobs are expected to enter London, where the bank employs 1,500 people.
In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 331 points, or 2.55%, at the close to 13,289.40, while the broad S&P 500 index rose 2.65%.
In London, the FTSE 100 index rose 165.5 points, or 2.7%, at the close to 6,306.2, adding more than <0xC2><0xA3>39 billion to the value of Britain’s top-tier companies.
Germany’s Dax index rose 2.6%, and France’s CAC40 was above 2.3%.
Earlier, the re-emergence of the credit strain in the markets was highlighted after a strong demand at a three-month fund auction from the European Central Bank, which considered those loans to European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
Pressure on the Bank of England to follow the action of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and inject extra funds into the stock markets in London, strained credit and rates of three-month “Libor” loans among British banks, the biggest rise since September, of 6.59%, after a steady rise since November 12.
England sues Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
Here are two dilemmas, each as difficult as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 for England in Kandy this weekend, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, none are less important than the first test against Sri Lanka, who should make the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the chairman of the team who is on loan--with that particular title at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the coach, and Michael Vaughan, the captain, decide; and also because the desk of Hugh Morris, director of England, is starting to fill with offers to become a national selector part, and if not, in one.
He who does not get the sixth place in batting will be unfortunate, but life is often unfair and the sport too.
It is not easy to throw what one man does at the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes for lack of luck rather than ability.
Not only in cricket the choice is difficult, as it requires judgements that always end up being subjective.
Is it the right time for Bopara to stand up?
Is it fair to Shah if he does?
The same question could be asked in another way if, says John Edwards or “Tubby” Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good grades and who know the business well, were to be promoted to the board: there is only room for one of them.
Who should say what is a good level for a cricketer, unless they give him the opportunity to sink or swim to the next chance?
Figures naturally have a great influence on decisions, but so do they have opportunities.
Within a team, a cricketer has to catch the eye of the captain at the same time as taking a wicket and a batter to get opportunities to change the order if he wants to have impact as a player someday.
But catching the eye of the selectors is more complicated.
There were many who improved last season, for example, James Anderson, who certainly plays in the first Test even if Stephen Harmison declares for "fit and bowls" as the wind in the nets.
Anderson took 32 first-class wickets in 33 races for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 in the same average, but both have had their highs and can expect more from these.
The games of Shah or Bopara at Asgiriya Stadium can be just a matter of opinion.
The option can break or make a man’s career, or it can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every Test and did well in the first, with 5 wickets and 40 useful runs, but it was Paul Collingwood, struggling to establish himself at the same time who became an important player, and despite scoring a double hundred against Australia in Australia, he may still be underrated.
The odds are that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after one more discussion at today’s session at Asgiriya Stadium, will follow their conservation instincts and favor Shah’s greater experience over young Bopara’s exuberance.
There are arguments for both.
Shah is favored by his brilliant and valuable early 88 debut test in Bombay, 32 hundred first-class versus only 6 of Bopara, who, at 22, is seven years younger, and has an excellent record against spin bowling.
But Shah made only ten runs in his two rounds in May against West Indias in the Test at Lords, his home as a Middlesex player, and that caused an immediate rejection of the selectors when Vaughan claimed his place for the next match, he seemed to have taken from his "batting" some momentum that in Bombay.
On the contrary, the Essex team is happy to live on swords.
He is caught for nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was summed up as when he turned his vehicle into an exhibition for England’s car sponsor, Volkswagen.
He suffered minor injuries and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing he did was take out his Vodafone (sponsored, of course) and call Alastair Cook, his teammate looking at the distance, to say excitedly, “Did you see that?”
Bopara is the best player, he is including his slippery pass to have effects on his moves that seem to satisfy him, as he beats with confidence and skill.
Choosing the right man is one thing, choosing the best time, another.
Maybe that's the real art of selection.
My inclination would be to give Bopara his chance, which does not mean that Shah does not stand out, as the tea leaves suggest, he is the one who plays here this weekend.
Buses Bring Refugees Back to Work – and the Fight Against Al-Qaeda
The first buses carrying Iraqi refugees from Syria began arriving in Baghdad yesterday, expelling the exiles who ran out of cash, no visa extensions and those who hoped the city would return to normal.
Some had even returned to fight the militants who drove them out of their homes.
At the Mansour bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official government convoy composed of a dozen buses, the terminal was filled with refugees from Syria and Jordan who had returned by private transport.
“I decided to go to Syria after many doctors were killed in Baghdad,” says Sabah al-Qubaisi, a Sunni doctor.
“I came back today for what I saw on TV and what I read in the newspapers, about what happened in Baghdad and that’s safe now.”
“They say that Mahdi’s army stopped killing people,” he says, referring to the Shiite militia of religious militant Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops to temporarily cease.
Qassim al-Atwani, a 38-year-old Shiite and professor in the Sunni area of Amariyah, returned with his two children because it was impossible to renew his visa in Syria because the regime does not want Iraqis working in his country.
His Shiite neighbors in Amariyah called him over the phone to tell him that a U.S.-allied force helped bring Al-Qaeda out of its stronghold west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of Jordan’s newcomers was the head of a Sunni and Shiite tribe who had been driven from their home in Sleikh north of Baghdad, by a grenade attack, after he urged citizens to rise up against al-Qaeda.
He had come to fight.
“Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they had started an anti-Al-Qaeda militia in Sleikh and that they needed my support and that of my colleagues.”
"That's why I'm back today," said Sabaah Alu Obeidi, 62.
Many said they were attracted by the growing calm in the capital since U.S. troops secured groups of “concerned citizens,” armed, and working in cooperation with the U.S. military to defend their neighborhoods.
But many said they had returned for visa denial and lack of money in Damascus, where more than 1.3 million Iraqis have settled in recent years.
Salaam al-Samarrai, a 51-year-old father of three, voiced common suspicion among the exiles that Nouri al-Maliki, the Shiite prime minister, asked the Syrian government to impose restrictions on refugees’ visas to force people to return.
More than two and a half million people are believed to have fled the country because of the sectarian death squads.
"We were fine until al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to stop granting visas to Iraqis, to force them to return to Iraq," he said.
“I can’t believe in a government that supports criminals who set my house on fire after I left it.”
Part of the reason for the cessation of violence is that the Sunnis have been expelled from Shiite areas and vice versa, relaxing the tension.
There is a fear that a sudden wave of refugees will re-emerge sectarian tensions and begin the struggle.
Little Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training and even shines by the international orientation of its high schools.
As in the whole country, the Sarlandes lack only one educational field.
“Yesterday I explained for the fiftieth time to a non-Sarlander that we are not French” – that was the irony about themselves of the smallest federal state for their fiftieth anniversary.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a major role in the educational system of the Saar that in a study of the Institute of German Economy (IW) called "Bildungsmonitor" occupied the fifth place.
In this way, higher schools traditionally have good relations with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbr<0xC3><0xBC>cken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today, students can finish their university career here with two or three diplomas.
As a result, the percentage of foreign students is high, at 15.6 percent.
However, the number of students from the Saarland is higher than the average in high schools, many of whom do not have a baccalaureate.
“The system of vocational education is being exploited in the Saarland,” says Axel Pl<0xC3><0xBC>nnecke, the education expert at the German Institute of Economics (IW).
More than one in five young people do their baccalaureate at the Professional School. Thus, it turns out that the Saar is 7 points above the national average.
On the contrary, the range of possibilities for a professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of double races, in relation to the population, is the second best in Germany.
Despite practical vocational training and growing demand, the number of engineering science graduates has dropped by a third in recent years.
That was the reason why the Ministry of Education of Sarre forced the higher schools to make more publicity for the specialties in Engineering Sciences.
“After the first PISA study, we carried out some reforms in general education schools,” said a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the government introduced comparative tests across the country.
In order for children to start studying the final year of the project called "Kita-Jahr" as soon as possible, this one has no cost. Meanwhile, this model also imitates the other federal states.
The comparison with the next studies will show whether the performance of the students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of students behind in school development dropped from 29 percent to 20 percent.
But overall, the Saar didn’t get much better than other federal states.
In Bavaria, students know how to calculate better.
To the chagrin of the Sarlandese, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Sarlandes are not French, the language of the neighbors is a compulsory subject in the Institutes of Secondary Education.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez changed the time.
Soon in Venezuela there will be another time zone different from the rest of the world.
On December 9, President Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez lets change the time in the South American country by delaying the clock by half an hour.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez is currently working as a comedian in Spain.
As reported by the Official Gazette of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the time will pass to less than four hours GMT.
In this way the South American country will have a time zone that does not exist in any other country in the world.
Among other things, Chavez, as an enemy of the United States, justifies his decision by saying that the United States imposed in his day the obligation to the world by changing a full hour.
In addition, on Wednesday (local time) Chavez announced the breakdown of relations with his neighboring country Colombia because of the hostage-taking action.
The left-wing nationalist said he would maintain no relationship with either the head of state or the Colombian government until conservative <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Uribe remained president of Colombia.
“My dignity does not allow me to do that,” says Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, who is pushing for a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
This reform could greatly expand its power in the country.
The reason for the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe to withdraw Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez’s mandate in the negotiations with the Marxist guerrillas in which it was about the release of the hostages.
Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez said on Sunday that Uribe's decision had offended Venezuela.
There is also a lot of talk about Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez in Spain.
A new tone of call causes sensation in the country: "Why don't you shut up?" is the phrase that half a million people have already downloaded.
This phrase was uttered by the King of Spain who was upset by the continued interruptions by left-wing populists at the last Ibero-American Summit.
In 2007, the decline in the real wage threatens the Germans.
According to a forecast, this year a decrease in the real wage threatens German employees despite a strong juncture.
Experts present a lot of reasons for a pessimistic prognosis.
According to the calculations of the Hans B<0xC3><0xB6>ckler Foundation, German employees should have a lower real wage bill in 2007 than the previous year.
"The fault is the weak evolution of wages, the increase in value-added tax and the tightening of food and energy prices," Gustav Horn of the Macroeconomics and Research Institute of Economic Cycles told the Bild newspaper.
Also the new unemployment insurance charges may correspond to the employees.
Finance Minister Peter Setinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck told the newspaper "Neue Ostanbr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung" that given the current situation, the intention to reduce the unemployment insurance burden by 3.3% over the course of one year to another is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the labor office does not have to get into an unpleasant situation again, asking for credits and subsidies to the Federal State, according to the words of a politician of the German Social-Democratic Party.
On Tuesday it became public that the inflation rate with the price explosion in the food sector and oil derivatives sector reached the highest level for 13 years.
When comparing prices with last year, prices are increasing by 3%.
Venus: twin brother of Earth.
Although its atmosphere is not suitable for life, Venus is the most Earth-like planet, something that until now had not been raised. The European probe "Venus Express" discovered rays in the atmosphere and swirls at the poles, the same ones that also appear in winter on Earth.
For three decades, researchers had suspected that there might be rays on Venus.
But now the European probe has brought new evidence: it discovered electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere. On Venus the rays are silent from a height of 54 kilometers from one cloud and behind another, says Cris Russell of the University of California at Los Angeles to the scientific journal "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of Urey-Miller's life, lightning caused life on Earth: storms may have caused reactions in the ocean that, in turn, would have given rise to the amino acids that are the basic components of life.
On Venus it’s not like that: if there were life there someday, that would have to be in one of the first states of evolution,” explains Sean Solomon of the Carnegie Institution of Washington.
Today, there can be no life on the surface of Venus: atmospheric pressure is almost 100 times higher than on Earth and temperatures of 500°C reign on the surface, oscillating in such a way that temperatures can be reached below zero.
"Possibly Venus is a 'diabolical' twin of Earth, but it's still a twin," Russell said.
The main goal of the Venus Express mission is to answer the question of why Venus, so similar to Earth by its mass and size, has had such a different evolution.
Since the 1990s there were no special missions, only for research of this planet, the launch of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest results of the research that will be presented in many articles of "Nature", according to the researchers, emphasize not only the uniqueness of Venus in the Solar System.
“This also shows that neighboring planets have more common features with Earth than we had expected,” ESA reports.
Despite the already known stormy winds at the North Pole, the researchers also discovered in the southern polar region a vortex formed by the clouds that rotates faster.
This phenomenon is reminiscent of wind flows in the high Earth atmospheric layers of the poles, as described by a team of researchers led by Giuseppe Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysics and Space Physics.
The second planet in the Solar System has almost the same mass as Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12,000 kilometers it is almost as large.
This planet also called the dawn star or evening star orbits the Sun for nearly 225 days.
But its rotation period is slower: a day on Venus is equivalent to 243 days on Earth.
Although Venus with its surface temperatures of 460 degrees and its atmospheric pressure of 92 bar does not closely resemble Earth, scientists start from the basis that both planets had formed under the same conditions.
Water had clumped on both planets and remained in the oceans on Earth, but on Venus it dissociated in the universe.
While on Earth carbon dioxide had become carbon stones, on Venus it forms most of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel’s meeting with the Dalai Lama.
Koehler, the Federal President, insists on the end of the fight between the parties for the reception of the Dalai Lama in the Federal Chancellery.
He indirectly criticized the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks on the Federal Chancellor after the rally in September.
Horst Koehler, the Federal President, is concerned about Germany’s reputation and therefore demanded that the grand coalition end that fight for the reception of the Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not present ourselves as a divided nation," Koehler told Handelsblatt newspaper.
At the same time Koehler showed his understanding regarding the reception of the Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) in September.
“Although I have great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolutely valid for me,” Koehler said.
Everyone knows that Germany has to act with great balance in terms of foreign policy, emphasizes the Federal President, defending Merkel for the reproach she received when carrying out a new policy with China.
“The Federal Chancellor did not distance herself from the traditional course of One China policy.
China knows that too,” Koehler said.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Social Democratic Party), had indirectly shown his disgust at the reception of the Dalai Lama and because of this he was attacked by the members of the Union.
Among other things, Steinmeier criticised the Union for its inoperative foreign policy.
The reception of the Dalai Lama at the Federal Chancellery caused great misunderstandings in Chinese-German relations.
Thus, the Chinese government not only withdrew the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democratic Party), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to information sources of the magazine "Spiegel", frozen the so-called strategic dialogue of the foreign ministries of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, the Chinese head of government, demanded that Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel recognize this reception of the Dalai Lama as a mistake.
Affirming China’s position, Wen Jiabao said China would not accept European politicians receiving the Tibetan religious leader in his official position.
The Dalai Lama’s actions and words showed that he was trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibetan region of China, which now includes other provinces as well.
Schaeuble warns that riots like those in France will occur.
Battles with police in the streets, shootings, car burning: Wolfgang Schaeuble warns that riots will occur as was the case in France.
The Federal Minister demands that every effort be made to ensure that social discontent in Germany does not spread to the streets.
Barricades were made, the vandals fired rifles at the police: after serious riots by young people in France, the Federal Minister of Internal Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Christian Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
“We also have to make sure that the social problems of our country do not take the violent form.”
"We have to take that seriously," he said in the newspaper Neue Presse, published in Hannover.
Not all young people develop in the constant change of social reality.
The federal state, federal states and municipalities are already working with emphasis to solve these problems, Schaeuble said.
This is not just about the integration of immigrants.
“From the Summit of Integration to the Conference of Islam: all this is already bearing its first fruits.”
It is still early to assume the end of the alarm.
At the same time, Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs do not have the same building and sociological problems as in France.
The young people staged serious riots in the streets with police north of Paris last night.
Cars and public buildings were also burned in Toulouse.
Kenan Kolat, the president of the Turkish Community in Germany demanded greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Kolat, in view of the unrest in France, warns of an imitative effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not as explosive as in France.
In spite of everything, actions are necessary.
Kolat said the unemployment rate among young people of foreign origin under the age of 25 is above average.
Care must be taken to ensure that there are more vocational training posts.
Kolat stresses: “We have to give young people a perspective.”
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "there is great social control in families", larger than the French country.
Moreover, most foreign-born youth do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Kolat says, “But in spite of everything, we have to be careful.”
“We need to give young people the opportunity to get a job or vocational training faster.”
Meanwhile, the night in the Paris suburb of Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
Hundreds of police officers took part in the action, a helicopter with headlights flew over the territory.
The authorities reported three arrests, as well as trash and burned cars.
Since the day before, a team of nearly 1,000 police officers has been taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of the Interior, announced that the police would take strict measures until necessary.
On Monday night about 80 police officers were injured by riots in Villiers-le-Bel.
The riots continued the following night in Toulouse.
The unrest began with a traffic accident on Sunday, where two young people died.
According to information provided by the prosecution, the death of the young people was not the fault of the police.
In the kingdom of Angela Wolke.
The performance far from the reality of the Federal Chancellor, shows that the coalition in terms of content reached its last point and that nothing more should be expected from it.
But in which country does the Chancellor really live?
After her desperate performance, indifferent and without much content in the general debate of the lower house must be said: she does not live in the country that would have to be governed by her.
As for the reproach that was made on him for having repeatedly dedicated himself to actions in foreign policy, the Chancellor rejected him with a presumptive phrase.
He said that would be a provincial way and thus showed that he did not want to understand what interests the critics.
In the lower house, it was stated very clearly to everyone that such a reproach was appropriate.
There could be no minimal interest or any feeling for the country’s problems.
But instead, Angela Wolke presented herself in this way: a very high policy that runs away in foreign policy and stays there without achieving anything in particular.
One example: the prevention of climate change: she praised herself very much for the decisions taken in Heiligendamm, but she says nothing about how these climate goals should be achieved here.
In general, this way of praising herself – for two years the head of the Party of the Christian Democratic Union has not been able to afford so much modesty.
He uses words to give people a boost.
And in this way it damages its public image by the pragmatic conception with which it solves problems without going through the branches.
But in the kingdom of Angela Wolke inner problems are appearances of little value.
Child poverty and concerns for low-wage workers?
The only thing he devotes himself to is to talk about that subject using subordinate prayers.
It’s amazing how many times you get it wrong when talking about the supplement for kids.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good sentence.
He begins to stumble "as if he had been in an unknown territory" when it came to more concrete information.
The Attacks section.
The two favorites, Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney, clashed in a heated debate over YouTube’s Republican presidential pre-candidates and now they must fear only one candidate from the outside.
Tensions between the candidates have been noted since the beginning.
Mitt Romney blamed his opponent Rudy Giuliani for turning New York City into “a haven for illegal immigrants.”
Giuliani responds to the former governor of Massachusetts by saying that he was the one who employed undocumented illegal immigrants, saying that he was the one who used the illegal immigrants without papers.
Candidates tend to attack: as so far the Republican group does not have a clear favorite, the eight presidential pre-candidates take advantage of the debate on CNN, especially to discredit their opponents.
The small 30-second videos, shot by internet users who were sent to YouTube, also don’t have much content.
“With this mode of isolation we let Hitler come to power,” that was John McCain’s rebuke to his opponent Ron Paul, the only one of the meeting who insisted on immediately withdrawing troops from Iraq.
Romney also receives a lot of criticism from war veterans in Vietnam when he refuses to recognize as torture the “Waterboarding”, a method of interrogation, by letting a person drown simulate his death.
Public reactions in the room in St. Petersburg in Florida show that meanwhile the most important issues of the campaign are others, not just the war in Iraq or the debates about torture.
The public always applauded very strongly when they praised conservative values and denied the rise in taxes.
So you can better see where the weaknesses of both favorites are.
"I was wrong at the time," Romney said, apologizing to people and television audiences for advocating abortion in 1994.
Giuliani, on the other hand, did not know what to say when asked what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time Musharraf ruled without a uniform.
A day after his resignation as army chief, the Pakistani president was sworn in as president.
This is the end of eight years of military rule in Pakistan.
Pakistan’s President Pervez Musharraf has been sworn in for a second five-year term.
Pakistani television broadcast the ceremony live at the Presidential Palace in the capital Islamabad.
Musharraf vowed to respect the constitution and act for the well-being of the nation.
On Wednesday, he transferred his command of the army to his confidant Ashfaq Kiyani and thus accepted international pressure, especially from the United States.
Eight years after he came to power with a bloodless military coup, the former general first rules the state as a civilian chief.
With his resignation as head of the Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other requirement is the end of the state of emergency, which was proclaimed by Musharraf on November 3.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the state's attorney general, after the swearing-in Musharraf will soon annul the state of emergency and fulfill the second condition of the West.
Since Musharraf was declared a state of emergency in the Supreme Court, there have been many jurists supporting him, and last week the country’s Supreme Court rejected all appeals before the controversial new election of the head of government on 6 October.
Meanwhile, in an attack on a military convoy in the North Watiristan region, five soldiers were killed and four others were wounded.
According to the army spokesman, a bomb exploded on one of the streets on the border with Afghanistan.
The founders of Krautrock are back.
The most famous German band of the 70s follows their activity: three members of "Harmony" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a re-release, a copy of "Live 1974" was made that was written at the band's best time.
At that time they were very famous in foreign countries.
The attendance of these three gentlemen at an official meal caused the sensation.
Each of them has in front of him his box, his cables and above all his buttons.
In the middle is Dieter Moebius who is 63 years old and is dressed in a white shirt.
To his left is Michael Rother, 57, who has his laptop and guitar.
On the right, looking out of the auditorium, is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73, who is very busy with the control panel.
Everyone contributes with their sounds, among them there is even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds become a piece of music.
This doesn't seem to bother the gentlemen.
Something very exciting for Krautrock fans was the fact that the band Harmonia would be making music again.
What needs to be revolted here is this: the questions with precision have shown that the band’s name reverberated in people’s minds, but it wasn’t so special that after 32 years the audience missed it so much.
But why can’t the Germans also applaud their living legend of the seventies?
Especially because the misguided Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in his own country.
When the entertainment industry awarded a "Echo" music award to members of Cologne's Can 2003 band for their life's work, the room could see the surprised faces of German pop artists.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf und Neu!, they all opened their mouths in amazement.
Later Michael Rother would spend time on stage during Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Ignorance in your country and recognition abroad are one thing.
It is a problem to remember this band, because the trio only existed for two years and at that time I did not achieve a great effect in the audience, however, it got it later thanks to the others.
Some time ago Moebius and Roedelius had made music with the artist Conrad Schnitzler and had a name, Cluster, which promised much fame.
At first they played in the basement of Berliner Schaubuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf that was patronized by a church.
For a time, Rother had a job at Kraftwerk and then worked as a guitarist for the band Neu! He managed to improve the fame of this German band that at that time was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed Cluster's musicians into exile at Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a 16th-century ruin, they lived as refugees from the city.
The way of life was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius could complain about his position.
It was an artist’s life full of surprises.
It is said that one day a banner appeared for Ottenstein’s Harmony singing association in the trash, which turned out to be a good name for the art.
There were also disadvantages in using the name Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik von Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simple, the band had financial problems.
Life as an artist wasn’t just about getting to know yourself.
The CD "Live 1974" was recorded during a concert in Griessem. Someone remembers that, in this recording almost 50 people participated.
Rother then expressed his desire to propel Harmony and do occasional rehearsals.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is contrary to custom.
In 1975, the band announced their separation.
Rother ended up involved in esoteric themes and secured his existence with albums such as "Flammende Herzen".
Cluster revived in the 1980s and since then has been more successful than Harmonia.
The live recording of the album in Griessmer, that is to thank Groenemeyer.
His music company Grienland set out to cultivate this German own contribution to preserve it as live music.
Like Roedelius's work, the band Neu! was also rediscovered.
The presentation of Harmony as a band takes place at the House of World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidized with public measures of the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, the Englishman, the old punk and the author of the manual "Krautrock Sampler".
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
In this way, all of Krautrock’s influences to the following pop music are present.
Harmony takes the position of a super-band, a post that was empty.
Brian Eno’s phrase, accompanied by special music, fills the room: “This music is the only music that is certain, it belongs to the future.”
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers on a farm.
The story of the legend's development is shown in the black and white photo projections, where you can see instruments with cables.
In the background there are three veterans who started improvising again.
They do nothing but attach the microphones to the organ and to the battery to be able to produce extraordinary tones with the help of the effects apparatuses they had built with their own hands.
Electronic music is what it should be today.
Three people who delve into the technique.
But that doesn't change anything.
Under the direction of Barbara Morgenstern, in a musical atmosphere she coughs, whispers and in a good moment of emphasis she sings "Aaaaaaah!".
Krautrock has always been a term of English origin.
It was never about rock.
The origin of the genre was not sought in the blues, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Kraftwerk) or fleeing from artistic and social conventions (Cluster).
He who shouts "68" here is also right, but now Harmonia remains calm.
On the stage he reflects very well on what is already evident.
Where does the music begin and end?
That can break one’s nerves or give you some quick moments of luck.
Richard Gere just lacks more cynicism.
The two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderischer Frieden" are again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But the two didn’t have much conviction.
Either the concepts are fixed a lot in actions and shootings or the two films are too exciting.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can't help in this case either.
At first there was good news: Karadzic and Mladic, the war criminals, continue to hide in the Balkan mountain, but precisely there, in the dark interior of the country during the Bosnian war, was rediscovered actor Richard Gere.
We had finally lost sight of the handsomest man of the eighties, because no one wanted to see him after his pleasant and unimportant roles in women’s films and after many press conferences on Buddhism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is perhaps the most important argument for watching the movie “The Hunting Party – when a hunter becomes what he pursues” (Why do movie titles have to be so long and silly these days?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the eye: in the background, his role as a reporter in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the fate and the film industry had not been so merciful to him. He was a man whose better times of life have already passed, which as a monument to the ruin of his decadence preserved most of it until now.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triumph, along with "Moerderischer Frieden" which is the German production and will also be presented this week, turn out to be just a series of unsuccessful films about the war in the Balkans.
The film "Moerderischer Frieden" can be narrated in a few words: it is about two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a Serb from the snipers of Kosovo, one of them acts very quickly and that also leads him to fall in love with her.
The sense of the film is lost by the actions and the shootings, although we celebrate that the Serbs are not presented once again as the only culprits.
The film is like the German series "Alarm fuer Cobra 11" without highway, but in a war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" can be investigated, because in reality there was never a good film about the war in the Balkans.
At another point, with another director and another screenwriter (Richard Shepard in two positions), the story about American war reporters going off to spot a Serbian war criminal called “the fox” could probably be a new “Apocalypse Now.”
Thus, the stories are surprisingly similar: the small teams go twice to the mountain to carry out something that the army cannot do and each time it turns out to be a trip in madness.
One reason for the failure of "The Hunting Party" is when at first they introduce us to Simon Hunt, to him who is not allowed to be simply a cynic with a heart.
No, the script also envisions a love affair with a Muslim Bosnia that they will kill later.
Then “The Hunting Party” is very far from reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters achieved with impressive speed what they could not achieve for five years NATO, the CIA and all the world’s bounty hunters, who went to capture the war criminal and leave the Bosnian Muslims to avenge themselves in a fair way.
It is so bad, that they want to appeal to the international court in The Hague based on the crimes against cinematic logic.
However, the purpose of the film is actually a deeply human one.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karad<0xC5><0xBE>i<0xC4><0x87> and Mladi<0xC4><0x87> are still free, and highlights that the Americans and the French are not really concerned about pursuing them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and the bad are so similar, so one comes to mind a very famous poem by Brecht.
In this poem it is a mask of an Asian demon: "In the great wrinkles of his forehead I see, sharing the feelings with him, how hard it is to be bad."
In movies like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show how hard it is to be good.
The problem lies not only in the genre of war films in the Balkans.
Recently in a newspaper published that all films about Iraq produced in Hollywood are fiascos.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film about South Africa.
Almost always there is a rule: when a star goes through a crisis region or through the minefields, then something like "Rangoon" appears with Patricia Arguette, "The Other Side of All Borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Bloody Diamonds" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All of these conflicts may have occurred in a short period of time.
They have to spend at least decades until Hollywood rolls out a good movie about the holocaust with the movie “Schindler’s List” as an example.
The classics such as the Vietnam War works "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their time were not unanimously celebrated as the masterpieces.
Today we may know too much about world conflicts, and that is why in our times every killing (Massenmord) is presented directly on two televisions at home.
And that’s because screenwriters don’t have the least care (which is necessary to be able to) to tell good stories.
“To be or not to be” or “The Great Dictator” turned out to be so good in the end, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn’t know how bad the Nazi regime actually was.
Maybe you don’t have to be a good person to make a movie.
Perhaps you have to be like novelist Lawrence Norfolk, with his sarcastic and distant look at an artist.
When asked about the parallels between his historical novel "Lempri<0xC3><0xA8>re's Dictionary" and the war in the Balkans, he replied: "That's only because some things never change."
The big cities will always be in danger, men will always be cruelly murdered and war will always reign in Yugoslavia.
Von Beust receives as a response the negative criticism about the Olympic Games.
The mayor of Hamburg received much criticism from politics and the economy for not applying for the Summer Olympics.
Many want to keep fighting for competitions in the water sports section.
But Beust remembers that you have to be realistic when estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, director general of the Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, said on Wednesday this resignation was "not good for economic location".
In recent times no other project in the big city has fostered as much motivation as the idea of organizing the Olympic Games.
"Without this goal, the political, sporting momentum could not be maintained at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz demanded the Senate not to forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "that refers to another time."
Mayor Ole von Beust said on Wednesday that Hamburg’s ambitions for hosting the Summer Olympics would not be realized until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the application for the Olympic Games, but the German Olympic Sports Federation decides on it," von Beust says in the WELT ONLINE.
He referred to the decision of the Sports Federation (Sportbund) expected in early December on Munich’s request for the 2028 Winter Olympics.
“This preference means for us that in this period of time, which until now we thought we would have until 2028, from the realistic point of view we will not have any chance.”
Despite all this, this dream did not end forever, von Beust said.
The Hamburg Sports Federation (HSB) regrets von Beut’s statements.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg does not want to apply for the Olympic Games.
"It's too soon to let the opportunity go, if at this point the plans are ruined," G<0xC3><0xBC>nter Plo<0xC3><0x9F>, HSB's director, said on Wednesday.
A waiver of the application is contradictory to the statement of the head of the senate that he made at a reception on the occasion of the general meeting of the German public sports federation of higher schools (adh).
There von Beust designated the Hamburg application for Universities 2015 not as a "substitute" for the Olympic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the Federation of Sports of the Higher Schools named Hamburg as a candidate for the application.
The German Social-Democratic Party (SPD-B<0xC3><0xBC>rgerschaftsfraktion) criticized the Senate for not taking advantage of such valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
“For many years the Senate delayed the development of the small neighborhood of Grasbrook, because this was in plans for the Olympic Games or the construction of houses,” said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, deputies of the German Social Democratic Party (SPD).
While the SPD always required an integrated planning of Olympia for the little Grasbrook and then the use of the houses built, the CDU stressed the importance of entertainment.
At the time, Hamburg’s bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics sparked great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg failed because of Leipzig.
It's not the wooden boxes.
Whoever relates the terms Sweden and wooden box, thinks of Ikea, but does not think of Andy Warhol.
Or is it?
Currently the wooden boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that weighs on Warhol’s list of works.
Most of the ninety-four "type" Shine-Boxes on this list are fake.
After a few months ago the Swedish newspaper "Expressen" put the doubt about the authenticity of the 1968 Brillo-Boxes artifacts found in Andy Warhol, the Museum Moderna Museet in Stockholm carried out internal investigations and came to disappointing conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the museum Pontus Hulténa reg<0xC3><0xB3>los, and the former director of the Museum Moderna regula.
Prehistory is too complicated with a confusing relationship between artistic and sponsored productions.
In 1964 Warhol created his first "Brillo-Boxes" in New York, painted the wooden boxes in red, blue and white, with the same sample that had "Brillo" soap powder cartons.
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his 1968 works at the Moderna Museet there were exposed hundreds of Gloss-cardboard boxes. These were not made by Warhol (because of the expenses), but were brought directly from the "Brillo" cardboard factory.
These were not works of art, but specimens (which were only objects) exhibited.
In the same year, 1968, Warhol allowed the production of wood-boxes in Sweden, but they were not exhibited at the Modern Museum.
Witnesses of that time now speak of nearly fifteen boxes, which at that time entered the history of art and auction as originals of the "Stockholm-type" "Bright-Boxes" authorized by Andy Warhol.
At auctions, some of them were bought for more than $100,000.
The problem is that after the famous museum director Pontus Hultén made false statements that in 1968 in Sweden were produced and exposed almost one hundred of the wooden boxes that Warhol left to him.
But in reality, 105 boxes were produced in the same year 1990 in Malm<0xC3><0xB6> for Hultén and for the exhibition in St. Petersburg.
By this time, Warhol had already been dead for three years.
Lars Bystr<0xC3><0xB6>m, the head of curators at the Moderna Museet museum, investigated six Brillo-Boxes owned by the museum and also three of the Swedish private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Stockholm. They were first printed and ground their tight silvers and then painted them in oil with the brush.
On the contrary, the structure of the copies of the year 1990 shows that the painting was applied with a roller without directly printing the pressed silvers. In addition, it is not about oil painting, but acrylic painting.
"These boxes have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from Andy Warhol's official glossy-box list," says Lars Nittve, director of the Moderna Museet Museum and adds that if the "Andy Warhol Art" Authentication Commission in New York fails to come to any conclusion, the Moderna Museet Museum will classify these six boxes as ex-copies.
Already in July, the Authentication Commission formally announced that it accepts these “serious accusations” that they are soap powder boxes.
But from that moment on, everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers surrender in Manila.
In the Philippines, rebel soldiers have surrendered who had entrenched themselves in a hotel in Manila and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Antonio Trillanes, who accuses the president of corruption and electoral fraud, told a reporter that he could not answer for spilling blood.
The soldiers loyal to the government had raided the hotel using tear gas.
Nearly two hundred soldiers had been holed up in the building for a few hours.
Nearly half of them, including Trillanes, were on trial Thursday for attempting a coup in 2003 that ended in failure.
He took advantage of the negotiations, in order to suddenly be able to deposit with about 30 supporters.
Evidently the military police who had to watch him had passed his ranks and followed his mutiny.
They entered the "Peninsula" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Government troops blocked the neighborhood in the vicinity of the Hotel Noble.
The president called an urgent meeting of the Security Cabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the national security adviser, condemned the soldiers’ behavior.
"People are fed up," Trillanes said.
"We're calling on people to come to our ranks."
General Danilo Lim, who previously led the elite Scout Reangers, said that soon the other military troops wanted to follow the march.
Big government critics called Thursday for a large demonstration against the president.
His government has been accused of corruption for months.
In 2003 the financial district in Manila was a site that attracted all the attention due to the mutiny that was attempted against Arroyo.
The uprising failed after about 24 hours because the army wanted to participate.
Since 1986, there have been at least seven attempted coups against the democratically elected government in the Philippines.
United Internet will be the largest shareholder of Versatel.
United Internet secured more than 20 percent of the shares of telecommunications company Versatel.
On Wednesday, the company reported that the average price per share is 14,46 euros.
It has only 20.05 percent of the share capital.
There was much speculation about the company's absorption.
There are also options to further increase the financial share in Versatel.
United Internet reported that with this step it wants to accelerate the consolidation of the German DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) market.
On Wednesday they already made assumptions about entering the business, after Brendenberg bank increased its stake in the Duesseldorf network operator by 5 percent to 15.1 percent.
In the financial market this means that the financial institution holds the equity securities for a third-party partner.
United Internet already on the previous day involved almost 10 percent of the telecommunications company Drillisch.
Drillisch in the capital expansion measure placed 17.4 million of the new shares that have a value of 106.4 million euros.
United Internet has bought 5.15 million shares for 31.4 million euros.
In addition, the companies began negotiations on DSL-product marketing cooperations.
“We are strengthening our collaboration,” a United Internet spokesman said.
The two companies founded an MSP joint venture to acquire competitor Freenet.
On Thursday, United Internet reported that at first, the two companies want to be happy with Freenet’s ten percent stake and do not make use of their right, i.e. they involve 18.49 percent of Freenet.
That meant that both companies retained all options, especially participation in the Freenet anonymous society.
Negotiations between United Internet and Freenet on a strategic partnership ended in mid-November.
This "game" with Freenet that will last for many months and is not very understandable is part of the consolidation of the German Telecom market.
At the end of the third quarter, Freenet had 2.9 million customers with a mobile phone contract and 1.27 million with a DSL contract or full contract.
Until now, the holding company of United Internet and Drillisch had a direct 6.01 percent stake in Freenet.
Then they had agreed that Drillisch was going to get the other four percent.
The right to buy 18.49 percent of the investment company Vatas was already agreed in August.
