Members of the House of Commons of Wales fear 'passing through Marretas'
There is a dismay on the part of some Members of the Assembly of Wales (AM) regarding the suggestion that their title be changed to MWP (Members of the Welsh Parliament).
The origin of this controversy lies in the plans to change the name of the assembly to "Parliament of Wales".
Some members of this assembly, of all political colors, fear that this will make them fall into ridicule.
A Labour MP stated that the group is concerned about the fact that "the designation rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
For non-Wales readers: in Welsh, "twp" means "idiot" and pwp means "excrements".
An AM from Plaid said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative MP said the group was "open-minded" about the name change, but said the MWP designation was verbally very close to Muppet.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh has a similar pronunciation to the letter u in English from Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, currently drafting legislation to introduce the name changes, stated: "The final decision on how the Members of the Assembly are appointed will obviously be taken by themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave its assembly the powers to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals, which saw widespread support for the proposal to designate the assembly as the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of the AM title, the Commission favoured "Wales MPs", or WMP, but the MWP option was more favoured in a public consultation.
Apparently, the AMs are suggesting alternatives, but the effort to rally consensus could be a headache for President Elin Jones, who is expected to present a draft legislation on the changes within a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes to the way the Assembly carries out its activities, such as rules on the disqualification of AMs and the configuration of the commission system.
When they debate the legislation, the AMs will have the final say on the question of how they should be appointed.
Macedonians will vote to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on changing their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which includes a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a complaint about its territory, having repeatedly objected to its requests to join the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the plebiscite on the name change, said he would ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is nothing more than the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
St. Martin's bells are silent at a time when Harlem churches are fighting for survival
“From a historical perspective, the elders I spoke to told me there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
"Today, there is neither one nor the other."
The disappearance of the bars, he said, was understandable.
“People socialize differently today,” he said.
“The bars have ceased to be the living rooms of the neighborhood where people go regularly.”
As for the churches, he is concerned about the possibility that the money earned from the sale of wealth will not last as long as the leaders expect" and that, sooner or later, everything will return exactly to the starting point.
The churches, he added, can be replaced by apartment buildings with condominiums inhabited by the type of people who will not support the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and therefore such will hasten the arrival of the day when these churches will all close, as it is unlikely that most of those who move into these complexes will join these congregations.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left here in the 1930s.
The building was later laid down by a black congregation that performed its services in the vicinity.
St. Martin's was occupied by a black congregation under the auspices of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the 125th Street shopkeepers, a major shopping street in Harlem that resisted the hiring and promotion of black employees.
A fire in 1939 left the building severely damaged. However, when they made plans for its reconstruction, Father Johnson's parishioners ordered the carillon.
Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the lane "the bells of the poor."
The expert who hit the railing in July called it something else: "a cultural treasure" and an "irreplaceable historical instrument".
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also mentioned that it was the world’s first carillon to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said St. Martin's didn't replace him.
What happened at St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay church leaders and others by the episcopal diocese.
The parish council, the governing body of the parish composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July, expressing its concern that it would "seek to pass on the costs" to it, to a lesser extent the fact that it had not been involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Wounds 13-Year-Old Teenager on Lobster Scuba Diving in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday during a lobster hunt in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly after 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard the boy screaming for help, then rowing towards him with a group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel stated that he initially thought it was only enthusiasm for picking up a lobster, but later realized that the boy was shouting "I was bitten"!
I was bitten!
The entire area of the collarbone was torn apart, Hammel described what he observed when he reached the boy.
"I yelled at everyone to come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was admitted in critical condition.
The species of the shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles said in a press release that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it was considered not to belong to a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries at the top of the trunk.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to enter the UK cosmetics market
Sainsbury’s is competing with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-style cosmetic sections, supported by expert assistants.
As part of a substantial initiative to gain market share in the UK cosmetics market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion, which has continued to grow as sales of fashion apparel and household items recede, these larger cosmetics sections will be tested in 11 stores across the country and will be rolled out in more stores next year.
This investment in cosmetics stems from the demand by supermarkets for ways to use exhibition space once used for TVs, microwaves and household items.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its catalog of beauty products by offering up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing L’Oréal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees ranges will also get more space with branded areas similar to those of Boots.
The supermarket chain is also relaunching its Boutique makeup range so that most products obey vegan precepts, something increasingly demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, perfume shop The Fragrance Shop will test concessions at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week. The second, at Selly Oak, Birmingham, is expected to open near the end of the year.
Online shopping and changing food shopping habits to small daily quantities at nearby stores have led supermarkets to now have to work harder to persuade customers to visit their stores.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores will increasingly resemble department stores, as the supermarket chain tries to combat the discount shops Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has been installing Argos points of sale in hundreds of stores, having also installed a number of Habitats, since it acquired both chains two years ago, and claims that this reinforced the sales of groceries and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The company’s previous attempt to renovate its cosmetics and pharmacy departments ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tested a partnership with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenue from health products stores in its supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Sainsbury’s sold its 281-point-of-sale pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million.
It was said by the company that Lloyds would participate in the plan by adding in four stores a wide range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer, Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our cosmetics sections to provide our customers with a more pleasant environment.
We also invest in specialized training of colleagues, who will be available to advise the client.
Our range of brands has been designed to fit all needs. On the other hand, the inviting environment and practical locations make us now an irresistible point of sale for beauty products that breaks with the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Peter Jones, star of Dragons Den, got “angry” after TV host Holly Willoughby abandoned an 11 million pound deal with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for branding Truly home items and accessories.
The business of both had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she would leave the partnership.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons star Den Peter Jones alive as she left the lucrative brand at the last minute to focus on her new highly profitable contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Some sources claim that Jones was “angry” when the TV gold girl admitted, during a tense meeting last Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new business (which could be worth <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million) implied she would stop having time to devote to her branding and acessories.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was expected to double Willoughby’s fortune, estimated at <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones was taking a plane to one of his vacation homes abroad.
A source said: “Truly was by far Holly’s highest priority.
It would mean the resolution of your long-term future and would be a financial support for the next two decades.
Your decision to leave has left everyone absolutely amazed.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday... it was so close to launch.
There's a warehouse full of ready-to-sell items at headquarters in Marlow."
Experts believe that the departure of the presenter of This Morning, which is among the most lucrative stars in Britain, could cost the company millions, given the heavy investment in products, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household items, and the potential for additional delays in the launch.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, with three children, and husband Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby created Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined the project as president in March.
The couples vacation together and Jones owns a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby is about to become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that "We don't intend to comment on your business."
Hard conversation "and then we fell in love"
The US president jokingly mentioned criticism that he would be targeted by the media for making a comment that some would consider "unworthy of a president" and for revealing such a positive attitude towards the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump claimed, in his feigned voice, "newspaper pivot."
"I didn't give in to anything."
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting after his initial meeting in Singapore in June, saying it would be a big step in North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations for denuclearization are dragging on.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that the North does not see a “corresponding response” from the US to the first steps toward North Korea’s disarmament.
Instead, he said, the U.S. is pursuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump took a more optimistic view in his speech at the rally.
"It's going very well with North Korea," he said.
“We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
Trump said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had brought positive results: the end of tests with rockets, support for the release of hostages and the return to the country of the remains of US military.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when speaking about relations with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be worthy of a president, but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to get into this overcrowded arena, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd directly in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia cause devastation on an island, killing hundreds of people
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10% of Lombok’s population had been evicted, it was not declared a national catastrophe, a prerequisite for channelling international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been clear that they are not asking for international aid, so it becomes a bit difficult," Ms. Sumbung said.
Although Save the Children is organizing a team that will head to Palu, there is still no guarantee that foreign personnel will be able to work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesman for the national disaster response agency, said the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the aid effort.
Despite the constant earthquakes suffered by Indonesia, the country remains terribly ill-prepared for the wrath of nature.
Although they were built in Aceh, tsunami shelters are not commonly sighted on other coastlines.
It is likely that the apparent lack of a tsunami alarm siren in Palu, to a poor degree the validity of a warning, had contributed to the loss of life.
In the most favorable times, traveling between the many Indonesian islands is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of this new disaster.
President Joko Widodo, who has made improving infrastructure a central part of his election campaign, has spent huge amounts on roads and railways.
However, the funding shortfall hit Mr. Joko’s executive at a time when he faces re-election next year.
The president is also under pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of their faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were displaced as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using chains, bows and arrows and other rudimentary weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool makes a long end to the draw goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved a Liverpool from a Premier League loss against Chelsea, with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri when he was about 30 meters from the Chelsea beacon, with his team losing 1-0.
He gave a touch to his left before making a stop towards the second beam.
In the attempt, the ball flew high over the large area as it headed for the top right corner of the net.
In the end, the ball fell over a Kepa Arrizabalaga in flight and fell into the net.
“I was just trying to reach that position, to go to the ball, and players like Shaq are moving as far forward as possible, so I was just gaining as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming, I touched it and I didn't think too much about it.
Chelsea won 1-0 at half-time after scoring a goal in the 25th minute of Belgian star Eden Hazard.
In that play, the forward of the blues gave a heel pass back to Mateo Kovacic before detaching near the midfield and sprinting towards the Liverpool area.
Kovacic made a quick midfield pass.
He then made a beautiful finish that crossed the opposing defense, leading Hazard to the large area.
He overcame the defences and scored against the second-leg net with a left-footed finish that passed by Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday in London.
Number of people killed in Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami rose to 832, the country’s disaster response agency said earlier on Sunday.
There are reports that describe a large number of people trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake on Friday, which triggered waves that reached 6 meters high, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with the rubble of the buildings that collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbing woman to death
A murder investigation was launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
The victim, 44, was found at 7:55 a.m. with gunshot wounds in Grayson Mews, on John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who may have witnessed something to give information.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I would like to appeal to all those who were in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and who witnessed something suspicious that they contacted us.
I would also like to appeal to anyone who may have obtained images with tablier cameras, particularly taxi drivers, to contact us, as they may have crucial information for the investigation.”
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a Birkenhead resident and was located inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the victim went to the scene to inquire about where she had been found this morning.
Investigations are ongoing, with police reporting that they are at this time informing the victim’s close relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews just tried to access his apartment, but was informed by police that entrances or exits from the building are prohibited.
When he was told what had happened, he was speechless.
Residents are now being informed that they will only be able to return to their homes in a matter of hours.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene in tears.
He says repeatedly, "It's so horrible."
At two in the afternoon, two police vans were inside the cordon and another was parked in the immediate outside area.
A number of police officers were deployed inside the cordon to guard the apartment building.
We ask those who have information to contact by DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling 0800 555 111 indicating the registration 247 of September 30.
Parliament’s Cromwell statue has become the latest monument swallowed up by the content of “historical revisionism”
Its removal would constitute an act of poetic justice for its destruction, reminiscent of the one perpetrated by the Taliban, of so many English cultural and religious artifacts, and which was carried out by its fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's suggestion as "a madness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable that in the current debate over the removal of statues, Oliver Cromwell’s figure next to Westminster Palace would become a target to shoot down.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is being sacrificed for the acts of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testimony to 19th-century opinion and part of historiography regarding a figure that many still believe to be worthy of homage.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is viewed by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than he is today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, in his case, of course, of the monarchy.
Whether or not this constitutes an entirely accurate description is the subject of a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the mid-17th century conflict shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and that Cromwell is a figure with individual notoriety that represents one side of that divide.
His successes as Lord Protector are also worthy of honor and celebration."
Killer Pig Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his nickname "Yuan", was found dead, with an artery cut and covered in blood, near a well in the market in Liupanshui, in Guizhou province, according to the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
The pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
According to reports, he traveled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered a door to an open neighboring well.
In that well, he said, was a large male pig with blood in its mouth.
A forensic analysis confirmed that the pig, weighing 227 kilograms, had attacked the pig farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were covered in blood and crushed,” said the cousin, referred to by his nickname “Wu,” according to the Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent it from attacking other people while police collected evidence at the scene.
Reports say Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although rare, cases of pig attacks on humans have been reported.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had immobilized a Welsh farm against its tractor until the woman had managed to scare the animal.
After an Oregon farm was eaten by its pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but that the smell of blood can work as a “stimulus.”
“They’re just playing.
They like to squeal, they're very curious... they don't want to hurt anyone.
We just need to show them respect,” he said.
Hurricane Rosa remnants should bring widespread heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, it will bring torrential rains to the entire Mexican north and southwest of the U.S. in the coming days.
At 5 a.m., Eastern Time on Sunday, the Rosa caused gusts of 137 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, located 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
However, a depression begins to form over the Pacific Ocean that moves to the west coast of the United States. As it approaches the Baja California peninsula, the Rosa, now a tropical storm, will begin to push a strong tropical humidity northwards in the southwestern zone of the United States.
On Monday, it will cause precipitation that can reach 25 mm in certain areas of Mexico.
At that time, tropical moisture interacting with the approaching depression will produce widespread heavy rains in the Southwest in the coming days.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 mm of rain could cause dangerous flash floods, littered with debris and possibly land flooding in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause precipitation that can reach 5 to 7 mm in punctual zones, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 mm of precipitation is expected in areas of the Southwest, especially over much of Arizona.
Sudden flooding is possible with rapidly worsening conditions, due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It is highly advised to walk in the desert on foot with the threat of tropical rains.
Heavy rainfall can cause gorges to turn into raging rivers and thunderstorms will bring strong punctual winds and dust clouds.
The approaching depression will bring heavy rainfall over parts of southern California’s coastline.
Total precipitation of more than 12 mm is possible, which may cause small spills of debris and slippery roads.
This may be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Tropical showers will begin to occur in Arizona in late Sunday and early Monday, before the rains become more widespread in late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread across the Four Corners on Tuesday and last until Wednesday.
The month of October may see strong temperature variations across the U.S. territory as the Arctic cools, but the tropical zones will remain fairly mild.
Sometimes this leads to drastic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is an excellent example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a nearly 11-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the coming days, persistent summer heat will tend to increase and expand again.
Much of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to record a warm start to October, with widespread temperatures between 27 and 30 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
The city of New York may reach 27 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about 5.5 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast indicates a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern U.S. by the end of the first half of October.
More than 20 million people attended Brett Kavanaugh’s hearing
More than 20 million people watched yesterday on six television stations the rapacious testimony of Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of alleged sexual abuse in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford.
However, the political stalemate continued, with stations halting regular programming due to a last-minute turnaround: an agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh groped her while drunk and tried to untie her at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in an inflamed testimony, stated that he has absolute certainty that this did not happen.
More than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen, are likely to have attended the hearing.
The company counted the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers of the other stations that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not yet available.
In addition, Nielsen generally has difficulty measuring audiences of those who watch shows in offices.
To give some perspective, this is a similar audience level to the end of an American football game or the Oscars ceremony.
Fox News Channel, whose commentators gave their strong support to Kavanaugh’s nomination, led all television stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day audience, Nielsen said.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
Then come CBS with 3.1 million, NBC with 2.94 million, MSNBC with 2.89 million and CNN with 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central figure in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying his vote would be in Kavanaugh’s favor, the senator was picked up by CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning to be verbally attacked by protesters as he tried to enter an elevator to address a Judiciary Committee hearing.
The senator remained motionless looking at the floor while being criticized live for CNN cameras.
“I am here before you,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
He was told that "you have power while so many women have no power at all."
Flake said his office had issued a statement and said, before the elevator door closed, he would have more to say at the commission hearing.
The cable and broadcasting stations were all covering the event in the live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee went to vote to have Kavanaugh's appointment proceed to a Senate plenary vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee over the next week, something the Democratic minority had come to demand.
Flake was partly convinced after talks with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and later with some other senators, he made his decision.
Flake's choice was decisive, as it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Prime Minister May accuses critics of “making politics” with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May has accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "making politics" with Britain's future and harming the national interest, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview with him on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson reinforced his attack on what is known as the minister’s “Chekers Plan” for Brexit, stating that a proposal that provides for Britain and the EU to cover the tariffs of the other party is “totally absurd.”
Wayde Sims Murder: Police Detain Dyteon Simpson Suspect in LSU Player's Death
Police detained a suspect in the deadly shooting of Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder, Baton Rouge Police Department said in a statement.
Authorities released a video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, with police claiming that Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered them at the scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA, according to the CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had fatally shot Wayde with a gun.
A bail of $350,000 has been established, the lawyer said.
The medical-legal office of the parish of East Baton Rouge issued a preliminary report stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head that extended to the neck.
The department reports that the collaboration of the Louisiana State Police Action Group, the state police criminal lab, Southern University police, and area residents who collaborated in the investigation led to this arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the area authorities for their “diligence and effort to get justice.”
Sims was 20.
This forward, 1.98 m tall, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
His average was 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated" and "shocked" by Wayde's death.
“This is what worries us all the time,” Wade said.
Volcano ejects ash in Mexico City
Ashes emanating from the Popocatepetl volcano have hit the neighborhoods south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Sunday advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after a resumption of activity in the crater, which recorded 183 gas and ash emissions over a 24-hour period.
The center detected numerous loud noises and tremors.
Images on social media showed thin layers of gray covering car windshields in neighborhoods in Mexico City like Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometers from the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were detained in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence protesters and intervention police, as thousands joined rival demonstrations to mark the first anniversary of the polarizing Catalan referendum on secession.
A group of masked separatists, locked up by the intervention police, hit her with eggs and threw powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust on streets that are normally crowded with tourists.
There were also clashes later, in which the police resorted to batons to contain the conflicts.
For a few hours, pro-independence groups chanting “We don’t forget, we don’t forgive” faced unionist protesters, who shouted “Long live Spain”.
Fourteen people have received treatment for minor injuries sustained in the protests, the local press reported.
Tensions remain high in the pro-independence region, a year after the October 1 referendum that was deemed illegal by Madrid but was held by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although turnout at the polls had been low, with a majority boycott of those who are against it.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block the ongoing vote at polling stations across the region, which resulted in violent clashes.
The pro-independence groups had camped overnight on Friday to prevent a demonstration of support for the national police.
Although it was held, this demonstration was forced to take a different path.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
“Last year we had our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we are blocked,” he said.
Despite having achieved a vital but tangential victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with their best-known leaders in voluntary exile or in detention awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police with his mobile phone, said the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"It's becoming increasingly tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders detained awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament in next year’s elections.
“Introducing myself as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression that we have witnessed on the part of the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: men arrested after car collision with a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car repeatedly collided with a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
At some point, someone may also have shot a beast at the car.
Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the win
Livingston, promoted to the first division, stunned the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard the second defeat of just two in 18 games as Ibrox's club coach.
Dolly Menga's attack made a difference, at a time when Gary Holt's team changes levels, with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard’s team, which remains without a home win in the first division this season, faces the Hearts leaders with eight more points next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna at home in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, however, has extended their undefeated confrontations in the division to six games, with head coach Holt not losing a single time since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against numb visitors
Holt's team should have advanced on the scoreboard long before the goal, as the incisive nature of their game was causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but let himself be dragged in front of the beacon and then Alan Lithgow only managed to steer his effort away after he had slipped to find Craig Halkett's head over the beacon.
The home team took it upon themselves to let the Rangers play in front of her, knowing that it could cause problems for visitors in the stale ball play.
And that’s how the crucial goal came about.
The Rangers conceded a free kick and Livingston got an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson coordinated to make the pass to Menga, who gave a touch and scored from the center of the large area.
At this point, the Rangers dominated possession of the ball, but faced an impenetrable home team defense, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no major problems.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to a defense.
Scott Pittman was frustrated by the Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor's feet, and Lithgow gave a touch away from another stale ball throw from Livingston.
Crossings continued to come to the large Livingston area, which were successively resolved, and two complaints of great penalty, one after Halkett's instigation of substitute Glenn Middleton and one after a hand, were rejected by the referee.
Livingston "phenomenal" - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were excellent without exception, continuing to exceed expectations in this upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have changed little since his return to the big teams, but it is necessary to praise Holt for the way he galvanized the eleventh since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was colossal, achieving an extremely well-organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall doing their best throughout the game.
Either way, the Rangers revealed little inspiration.
Despite the excellent quality sometimes demonstrated with Gerrard, the team fell far short of these standards.
Their final move was little inspired (only once they managed to open the home team), constituting a sort of warning to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an is ambiguously received in Cologne
There were smiles under a blue sky on Saturday (September 29th) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, whose goal was to repair relations between NATO allies.
The dispute involved issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s access to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a new and gigantic mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside its country.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent a crowd of more than 25,000 people from rallying in front of the mosque, but many supporters were there to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also made themselves heard, condemning both the president’s policies and the German government’s decision to host him in the country.
The antagonistic protests reflect the divisive character of a visitor hailed as a hero by some German Turks and hated as an autocrat by others.
Road accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, near 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and a rescue team intervened, but the cyclist died on the spot.
This collision comes months after the death of another cyclist in a runaway collision on Childers Street, about a mile away from Saturday’s crash.
The Metropolitan Police said officers are trying to identify the person and inform their relatives.
Barriers and detours to buses were placed, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured in Disruptions
Six prison officers were injured in riots in a high-security male prison, the Prison Office said.
The unrest, which is still ongoing, began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at around 9:30 a.m. on Saturday.
Special agents "Tornado" have been called in to solve the problem, which involves eight inmates and is restricted to one wing.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries at the scene.
A spokesman for the Prison Services said: “Specially trained teams were used to resolve the ongoing incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six members of staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and it should be clear that the names of those responsible will be communicated to the police and they can spend more time behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had to receive hospital treatment after being attacked by a prisoner.
In addition, in October last year, intervention police officers were called in to solve a serious disorder in which personnel were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (the drought-affected areas may benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it’s exactly what’s predicted for early next week, when the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa crosses the Southwest Desert, implicating the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued flash flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
The Rosa is expected to take a direct course over Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained a state of tropical storm or depression within a 300 km radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that passed 60 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 5 to 10 mm of precipitation, with isolated amounts that can reach 15 mm in Arizona’s Mogollon Rim.
Other areas of the Southwest Desert, such as the Central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin may receive 3 to 5 mm, with the possibility of isolated totals that can reach 10 mm.
For those not affected by the risks of sudden flooding, the Rosa rain can be a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although floods are a very serious concern, part of this precipitation can be beneficial, as the Southwest is currently being affected by the drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona suffers from at least extreme drought, the second most severe category.
First, Hurricane Rosa will hit the mainland by crossing the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa, still with hurricane strength on Sunday morning, with winds at maximum speeds of 137 km/h, is located 619 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, moving north at a speed of 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is weakening.
Thus, it is expected to reach the coastal zone in Mexico with tropical storm strength in the afternoon or on the evening of Monday.
Heavy rainfall may occur in parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
“Total rainfall is expected to range from 8 to 10 mm from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a possible maximum of 25 mm,” the weather.com website said.
The Rosa will then head north, crossing Mexico as a tropical storm before hitting the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, which will then head south to Utah in the late hours of Tuesday night.
“The main expected danger from the Rose or its remnants is very high rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Southwest Desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to produce sudden floods and spills of debris in the deserts, at risk of life, and feeding on mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three male teenagers and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, near 4:00 a.m., British summer time, on Saturday.
He was transported to the hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old teenager, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man in the Radstock area were detained overnight, Avon and Somerset police said.
The agents appealed to everyone who could own mobile footage of the incident that occurred.
Trump says Kavanaugh was "victim of the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party
“A vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party’s relentless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "was a victim of the malice and anger" of the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, having vigorously and emotionally denied an accusation by Christine Blasey Ford that she had sexually abused her for decades when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing about his claim.
The president said Saturday that "the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's brilliance, quality and courage" on that day.
“A confirmation vote by Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation vote from one of the most successful legal minds of our time, a lawyer with a brilliant public service curriculum,” he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The president later referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not competing, but I’m actually competing,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going everywhere to fight for great candidates.”
Trump has argued that Democrats are on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The Senate's first procedural vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is scheduled to take place no later than Friday, a senior GOP deputy told CNN.
Hundreds dead in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia; numbers continue to rise
At least 384 people have died, many of them dragged by the giant waves that hit the beaches when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu on Friday, when waves up to six meters high hit the beach at dusk, dragging many to death and causing a trail of devastation on their way.
The tsunami occurred in the aftermath of a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still in their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee, having been victims of what happened,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency to reduce the effect of Indonesia’s catastrophes (BNPB), said in a statement in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not move alone: it dragged cars, logs, houses, hit everything on land," Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami was moving in the open sea at speeds of 800 km/h before hitting the coastline.
Some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
The aerial photographs released by the agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges deformed and collapsed, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The coastal city continued to be rocked by aftershocks on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million inhabitants.
The Indonesian Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive quake was about 200 times the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city’s geography, located at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have amplified the size of the tsunami, the statement said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings were found, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage may be deeper along the coastline 300 km north of Palu, an area named Donggala, closer to the quake's epicenter.
The communications "were totally disabled and there was no information" about Donggala, Nugroho said.
There are more than 300,000 inhabitants in the area,” the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said the waves emerged at the time the warning was issued.
In an amateur video posted on social media, you can see a man on the top floor of a building shouting frantic warnings that the tsunami was approaching, to people on the street below.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water collapsed on the coast, dragging buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused an extensive power outage that disrupted communications in the Palu area, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army began sending cargo aircraft with the help of Jakarta and other cities. However, the evacuees still desperately need food and other basic products.
The city's airport was reopened only for rescue efforts and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo marked a visit to the evacuation centers in Palau on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is growing exponentially to more than 800.
It's very bad.
Although it has managed to safely reach the city of Palu, where employees are housed in canvas shelters mounted in the courtyard of their offices, the staff of the World Vision of Donggala have traversed scenes of devastation on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of houses destroyed," he said.
It's very bad.
Even as aid groups began to begin the dark tasks of assisting the victims of the disaster, some complained that the highly experienced foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign financing, supplies and personnel can only access the site if it is declared a "national disaster zone".
That hasn't happened yet.
“This is still at a level of provincial catastrophe,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says ‘OK, this is a national catastrophe,’ we can open the doors to international assistance, but that status does not yet exist.”
Falling from the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing still held hope that their loved ones would be part of the miracles that mitigate the gloomy headlines of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a boy was removed from a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had trained two of his missing athletes for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a senior paragliding practitioner, I have to carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that in the hours after news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel had begun to circulate among the paragliding community, he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the athletes of Palu, who were participating in the festival on the beach.
However, their messages produced only a gray check mark, rather than a pair of blues.
"I think that means that the messages were not delivered," he said.
Thieves take $26,750 during ATM refueling in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was refueling an ATM in Newport on the Levee, according to a statement from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was emptying an ATM in the amusement complex and preparing to introduce more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was busy, another man "came running behind the Brink's employee" and stole a bag of money destined for a delivery.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Those who have information about their identities should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
In announcing this change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: “Being previously known to Kanye West.”
West, 41, received the nickname Ye some time ago and used it as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes before his participation in Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to present his new album Yandhi.
This intervention is intended to replace that of the singer Ariana Grande, who canceled it for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
At the same time being an abbreviation of his current professional name, the word has a religious meaning for him, according to West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier this year when commenting on the title of his album with radio host Big Boy.
"Therefore, I am you, I am us, we are us.
It comes from Kanye, which means "the one", to just Ye - being just a reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is more a reflection of who we are.”
Kanye is part of a series of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known alternately by Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z, also used variations of his name with or without hyphens and capitals.
In Mexico, AMLO pledges not to use military against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has vowed not to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody crackdown on students.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza "never to use the army to repress the Mexican people".
Militants fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square on October 2, 1968, resulting in a death toll that may have reached 300 as leftist student movements spread across Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by granting them monthly grants to those who study and by opening more public universities.
The president said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities drag young people into criminal gangs.
U.S. to double funding for artificial intelligence
At a time when China is stepping up its activity in the field of artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double research spending in this area, said Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and professional in the field who worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several U.S. government departments made AI-related announcements, even though the country does not have a formal global AI strategy.
However, China unveiled its plan last year: it aims to lead innovation in AI by 2030.
“Duplicateing the AI research budget would be a good start, given that all other countries are so behind the U.S. and we are looking for the new revolution in AI,” Lee said.
Duplicate funding could double the chances of the next big AI success being achieved by the United States, Lee told NBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that defeated Othello's top-ranked American player. Later, he served as executive at Microsoft Research and was president of Google's China branch.
Lee gave credit to previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Department’s Robotics Challenge Agency for Advanced Research Projects and asked when he would be next, with a view to helping identify the next visionaries.
U.S. researchers often have to make a big effort to get state funding, Lee said.
“It’s not China that is stealing academic leaders; it’s companies,” he said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university luminaires to work on AI.
Lee said changes to immigration policies could also help the U.S. boost its AI efforts.
"I'm of the opinion that green cards should be automatically awarded to PhDs in AI," he said.
The Chinese State Council presented its Next-Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The National Natural Sciences Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions in a manner similar to that used by the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund researchers in the United States. However, the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is intended to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of the Restricted Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month a $2 billion investment in an initiative designated by AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission for Artificial Intelligence has not advanced for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
Macedonians went to the polls on Sunday to decide whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", an initiative that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked its requests to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which is part of a province called Macedonia, insists the name of its northern neighbor represents a complaint about its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposal for a new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would be a blow to the ethnic identity of the majority-Slav Macedonian population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has raised questions about whether the turnout at the polls will be enough to meet the 50% needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question of the referendum was: "Is it in favor of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, which includes Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that it is a price worth paying to continue the admission efforts in bodies with the EU and NATO to Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live free under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska in Skopje.
Although the referendum is not legally binding, a sufficient number of members of parliament said they would respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The National Election Commission said there had been no record of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to the 34% obtained in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of registered voters attended to vote.
"I came to vote for my children; our place is in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a Skopje-based voter from the capital.
Macedonia’s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in a referendum on changing the country’s name, which would open the door to their accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and for the EU, but we want to join with our heads held high and not through the service door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to welcome us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia to become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev said that joining NATO will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I believe that the overwhelming majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said.
A “yes” would be the “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Political Research Institute of Macedonia revealed that between 30 and 43% of voters would participate in the referendum, less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Telma TV of Macedonia, found that 57% of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote yes.
For the success of the referendum, the turnout must be more than 50% plus one vote.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first major setback in pro-Western government policy since it took office in May last year.
Sergio Aguero of Manchester City crosses the entire defence of Brighton towards the goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling obliterated Brighton's defense in a 2-0 win against Manchester City on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy on his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine forward received a midfield pass at the start of the play.
He sprinted between three Brighton defenses before cutting to open field.
He was then surrounded by four green shirts.
He faked a defense before neutralizing in the race more others in the boundaries of the large area of Brighton.
He then made a pass to his left, where Sterling was.
The advanced Englishman used his first touch in the big area to return the ball to Aguero, who, with his right boot, defeated Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-hand end of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with some foot problems,” City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We said he would play for 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the opening lead in the Premier League confrontation.
This goal was scored in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball well into Brighton territory in that play.
He made a pass over the defenses along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
This gave a few touches before driving Sterling towards the second beam.
The Sky Blues forward kicked the ball into the net immediately before slipping out of the bounds of the field.
City face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to make life harder for the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the final, there wasn’t much reason to force another start.
However, the always-competitive Scherzer has hopes of going on the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there are implications regarding the final for the Rockies, who hold a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies were at least lucky with a 5-2 win against the Nationals on Friday night, but still have plans to secure their first division title.
“Even if we’re playing for nothing, at least we can get on the pitch knowing that the environment here in Denver, with the crowd, the other team will probably play at the highest level I could face this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in these conditions?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the title pitcher for Sunday, but some say they are inclined to allow Scherzer to make the pitches in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his 34th start, made a bullpen session on Thursday and would pitch in his normal position on Sunday.
The right-hander from Washington goes 18-7, with an ERA of 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump is holding a rally in West Virginia
The president later referred to the situation surrounding his choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while mentioning the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big... I’m not competing, but I’m competing and that’s why I’m everywhere fighting for great candidates.”
Trump continued, “You’re seeing this horrible, horrible group of radical Democrats, you’re seeing it happen right now.
And they are determined to regain power by using all the means necessary. Do they see the evil, the sordid?
They don’t care who they strike, who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control, and we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, have a mission to “resist and obstruct.”
“And they’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “aggressive, mean, sordid, and lying.”
The president referred to Dianne Feinstein, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, by name, having received audible wails from the public.
"Do you remember your answer?
Did you cause the document to leak?
Uh, uh, what?
No, um no, I, wait, one — that was a bad body language — the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer inclusive.
It is intolerant of those who openly give their opinion.
When the Momentum activists of my local party organization voted to censor me, it was no surprise to me.
In the end, I am the latest of a number of Labour MPs in Parliament who have been told they are not welcome - all because we have openly expressed our views.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, has been the target of similar treatment because she resolutely faced anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar themes on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notification to the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "we intend the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour representative in parliament, the General Committee meetings were exactly that.
Unfortunately, today, it has ceased to be the tone of many of the meetings and the promise of "kinder and kinder" policy has long been forgotten, if it has ever come true.
It has become increasingly apparent that different views are not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that every opinion is judged on whether or not it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy took the lead, as colleagues with whom I thought I shared a similar political perspective began to expect a turnaround from me and to take positions I would never agree with - be they on national security or on the EU's single market.
Whenever I speak in public (and no matter what I say), there is a torrent of insults on social networks that call for “good-bye,” denouncing the center’s policies, telling me that I should not belong to the Labour Party.
And I'm not the only one going through this.
In fact, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, since the comments that are addressed to me tend to be of a political nature.
I am amazed by the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a barrage of sexist or racist insults every day, but who never back down from them.
One of the aspects that disappoints me most in this era of politics is the way these levels of insult have become normalized.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we have ceased to be inclusive, and with each motion of "censorship" or change in the rules of selection the party narrows its views.
I have received countless advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, not to be so expressive, and that it would “be all right” for me.
But that's not why I came here to do politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, driven by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left my comprehensive school classroom literally in ruins, I have sought to fight for better public services for those who need them most, whether as mayor or as a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my policies, including in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused as to my political positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
For those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I have to say is that when the country is heading for a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on the issue of my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
But in fact, the message I have is not for the Nottingham Momentum; it is for my constituents, members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threats of “dismissal” or political expedients will prevent me from acting in the sense of what I believe to be the interests of all of you.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: the unbeatable Ayr goes to the top
Two late tries somehow envied the result, but there’s no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this incredibly interesting Tennent’s Premiership game of the day.
The team is now at the top of the table, the only one of the ten without defeats.
In the end, it was a superior defense and better management of the risks that made the home team take the best, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We have been tested in our games so far and we remain unbeatable, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "The credit goes to Ayr. They managed the risks better than we did."
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute trial, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loaned to the game by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to give expression to the numbers, with Jason Baggot taking advantage of a non-converted test.
Climo extended Ayr's advantage with a large penalty, before immediately before halftime he scored and then converted a ground try to put the score at 17-5 for Ayr at halftime.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's trial, converted by Baggot, reduced the disadvantage to five points.
A long break followed due to a serious injury from Ruaridh Knott, who was transported from maca to the outside and, after the restart, Ayr reinforced the lead with a Stafford McDowall trial converted by Climo.
Ayr's captain in charge, Blair Macpherson, was then given a yellow card, and once again Melrose took advantage of the numerical advantage with an unconverted essay by Bruce Colvine at the end of an intense pressure raid.
However, the home team returned, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for knocking down Climo without the ball, in the penalty shootout, MacPherson put the ball on the ground behind Ayr's advancing maul.
Climo converted, as he had done almost immediately following the restart, after Kyle Rowe had picked up David Armstrong's box kick and sent the wing Gregor Henry to the fifth rehearsal of the home team.
Still Game star ready for a new career in the restoration business
Ford Kieran, star of Still Game, appears ready to enter the restoration industry after learning he was appointed director of a licensed restoration company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, who writes and participates with long-time comedian partner Greg Hemphill.
The pair announced that the ninth season, which will premiere soon, will be the last in the series, and it looks like Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kiernan was intending to get involved in the "flourishing Glasgow restoration business".
"The sea is ours": Bolivia, a landlocked country, hopes the court will reopen a path to the Pacific
Marines patrol a rope-covered naval base in La Paz.
Public buildings display a blue-marine flag.
The naval bases of Lake Titicaca for the Amazon bear the motto: "The sea is ours by right.
Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a landlocked country, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still alive, as is the desire to sail once again in the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are perhaps at their highest point in decades, as Bolivia awaits an International Court of Justice ruling on Oct. 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, a positive perspective on the result,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will witness the delivery of the TIJ sentence on giant screens scattered throughout the country, hoping that the Hague court will deliberate in favor of their country’s claim, so that, after decades of uncertain negotiations, Chile will be forced to negotiate, granting Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian indigenous president, who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has much at stake in Monday’s sentence.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” the president said in August.
However, some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia, and that little would change even if it did not.
The UN body, based in the Netherlands, has no powers to assign Chilean territory to another country and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible negotiations.
That TIJ’s sentence be handed down just six months after the hearing of the final allegations indicates that the case “was not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And far from promoting the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have hurt it.
"The issue of access to the sea has been seized by the current Bolivian administration," Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ belligerent rhetoric undermined some residual Chilean goodwill, he suggested.
At some point in the future, Bolivia and Chile will continue the talks, but it will be extremely difficult to maintain the dialogue after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision process was unusually fast.
Next Monday will give Bolivia “an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end 139 years of mutual benefit disagreements,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never waive its right to access the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The sentence is an opportunity to understand that we have to go beyond the past.”
North Korea Says There Will Be No Disarmament Without It Trusting the U.S.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, said his nation would never get rid of its nuclear weapons if it did not trust Washington first.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
In his speech, he urged the United States to keep the promises it made during a summit in Singapore among the leaders of the rival countries.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be about to restart stalemate nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after Singapore’s summit with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was an "impossible dream" to consider that continued sanctions and the U.S.'s objection to a declaration that would put an end to the Korean War would ever bring the North to its knees.
Washington fears it will accept the declaration without Pyongyang taking any significant first steps toward disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump are seeking a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang actually intending to reduce an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest line of huge hats on the way to a store near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or protect yourself completely from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented on the runway a series of extravagant and oversized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collections, which stunned the style set at Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, Instagram was flooded with very impractical hats and these designers sent these amazing creations to the catwalk.
Valentino’s most prominent piece was an extravagant beige hat adorned with a broad feather-like flap that flooded the models’ heads.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-shrouded watermelons, a sorcerer's hat, and even a pineapple, though the same were not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks...even in time for the carnival.
Many of the colorful masks had cooked lips and looked more like Hannibal Lecter than with high stitching.
One of the creations resembled diving equipment, with tube and glasses, while another looked like a melted ice cone.
And if you want to continue this immense fashion statement, you’re in luck.
Stylist observers predict that these huge hats are on their way to a store near you.
Oversized hats appear effervescent on the trail of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 61 cm flap that has been worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the very impractical hat that spread through social networks sent another great creation to the catwalks: a straw beach bag almost as big as the bathing suit that carried it.
The burnt-orange raffia bag, adorned with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the highlight piece of Jacquemus’ 2019 spring-summer La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I'm looking forward to seeing big hats and beach bags coming to stores next summer. Once the designer has had so much impact, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools benefit from a curriculum of academic excellence, having this trend continued in 2018 with another set of exceptional test results, reinforced by individual and collective success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With more than 30,000 students spread across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to achieve the best level of service for both students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for the deepening of their studies and access to universities, as well as for the career they have chosen and to take their place as global citizens.
Since this is an educational sector capable of designing and implementing a tailor-made school curriculum, we see that modern languages continue to be a popular and sought-after topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If we talk to a man in a language he understands, we can get into his mind.
If we speak to him in his own language, we can enter his heart.”
This quote reminds us well that we can’t just rely on English when we intend to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
Based on the results of this year’s recent exams, we found that languages are at the top of the table, with the highest rates of use from independent schools.
A total of 68% of students who studied foreign languages reached the maximum grade of A.
These data, collected in the 74 schools under the SCIS, show that 72% of students obtained the maximum grade of A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also obtained an A.
This demonstrates that Scottish independent schools are favouring foreign languages as vital skills that will unquestionably serve children and young people in the future.
Languages, as an option, are now viewed in the same way as STEM topics (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and beyond.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that, among the reasons for employers’ difficulty filling vacancies, 17% were related to language skills shortages.
Therefore, knowing other languages is increasingly an imperative to prepare the young generation for their future careers.
With more potential job opportunities requiring language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of your chosen career, if you have learned a second language, you will have a tangible advantage in the future with a life-like aptitude.
The ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will automatically put a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% did not speak a foreign language well enough to maintain a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a two-digit ratio, 15%.
Therefore, investing now in language teaching is important for today’s children.
The mastery of several languages, particularly those of developing countries, will give children with better chances of finding employment with relevance.
In Scotland, each school differs in the languages it teaches.
Some of them will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach languages considered the most important for the UK for the 2020 horizon, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child’s interest, there will always be a set of languages to choose from in independent schools, supported by specialized teaching staff in the area.
Scottish independent schools are committed to providing a pedagogical environment that prepares children and gives them the skills necessary for success, whatever the future holds for them.
It is undeniable that today, in a globalized business environment, languages continue to be of fundamental importance for the future of the country.
In fact, modern languages should be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to make this option available with diversity and excellence to young Scots.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron kicks off at the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is over for fans who want to see LeBron James start at the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will take part in Sunday's opening game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes you will play is yet to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers journalist Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play a limited number of minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game schedule in the preseason.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to be ready,” he said.
Time and YouTube channel of Trump’s rally in West Virginia
President Donald Trump kicks off a round of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, which include stops in friendly locations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the conformation vote pending for his chosen for the Supreme Court seat, Trump intends to bolster support for the midterm elections to be held soon, as Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress after the November vote.
What time is Trump’s rally in West Virginia tonight and how to watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is set for 7 p.m., Eastern Time, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below in a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address this week’s hearings of Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh, who has become tense over allegations of sexual abuse. The confirmation vote expected in the Senate will be on hold for a week while the FBI investigates.
However, the main goal of this torrent of rallies is to help Republicans, who face a difficult election in November, gain some momentum.
Trump’s campaign officials said the five rallies next week were intended to “energize volunteers and supporters at a time when Republicans are trying to protect and expand the majorities they hold in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so fundamental to the president's agenda that he will visit as many states as possible as we approach the campaign season turmoil," a Trump campaign spokesman said in a statement.
Marked for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening rally could draw supporters “from Ohio to Pennsylvania and get coverage from the Pittsburgh area’s media,” according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will mark the second time this month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state in which he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, at a disadvantage in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to give him help in the polls," Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. team shows it has the strength to fight to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday singles
After three uniform sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes could be exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The pendulum swing of momentum is a totally invented sports concept, but it’s one that players truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like these.
So where would you say the momentum will come now?
“They had a six-point advantage and now they’re four, so we’re looking at that as a bit of momentum, I would say,” Spieth said as he was leaving the field at the end of the day.
Europe is ahead, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more in the game.
Americans, as Spieth claims, still have some reserve energy and many reasons to feel encouraged, especially given the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and each of them scored three points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and is leading by example.
Those partying guttural screams became louder as the round went on, with a crucial putt that made the fourth game an all-square when he and Thomas were two holes behind in two.
His putt that won the game in the 15th produced a similar cry, of the kind that reveals that he still believes the American team continues in the competition.
“We just need to focus and worry about our own game,” Spieth said.
That's all that's left for each of these players.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable revelation of the Ryder Cup.
The European pair, unlikely but adorable, is four in four and can’t go wrong.
The "Moliwood" was the only duet not to do a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine on Friday morning.
In this series, and given the way their energy seems to flow from and to this turbulent crowd, the idea is consolidated that they are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there is no player more popular to seal a potential European victory at sunset at Le Golf National than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably, both simultaneously in different holes.
However, the discourse on the glory of Europe remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson defeated Sergio Garcia, the fourball hero this morning, when they teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine shoved the Spanish and Swedish into a hole they had never been close to leaving.
However, on Sunday, there is no one to help them get out of it.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to see up close because of the interactions between partners, the advice they give or don’t give, and the way strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better in the team so far and gained a significant advantage on the final day. However, this foursome session also demonstrated that the U.S. team has the stomach for the fight that some, especially in the United States, doubted it had.
Europe with a 10-6 lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enter the final day of the Ryder Cup with a clear advantage after coming out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The inspired duet of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a Tiger Woods with difficulty to reach the classification in Le Golf National, so far, four points.
Thomas Bjorn’s European team, struggling to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an unsuccessful American team in the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes with two games won, but failed to shorten the disadvantage.
Jim Furyk’s team needs eight points in Sunday 12 singles to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European starter to win four points in a row when he and Molinari, who received the nickname "Molliwood", after a sensational weekend are only the only duo to win four points in their four opening matches in Ryder Cup history.
Having crushed Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they superbly consolidated the lead, defeating a Woods without energy and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more emphatic 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, revealed occasional accesses of genius, but has already lost 19 of the games he played in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, resting during the morning fourballs, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, defeating 2&1 Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, first and third ranked in the world rankings.
However, on this pleasant day with a slight breeze southwest of Paris, Europe did not always take the best.
Jordan Spieth, three-time winner of major men's tournaments, and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
The duet scored a 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy by 4&3 in the foursomes, having lost both opening holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team reversed a four-point deficit before the singles, although the team of Furyk, holder of the title, only needs to tie to retain the trophy.
After two days in the second position, a counter-attack on Sunday seems to be beyond its possibilities.
North Korea Says 'Don't Think' of Unilateral Disarmament Without Confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were exacerbating mistrust of the United States and that there was no way the country could unilaterally dispense with its nuclear weapons in those circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the world body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" last year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test center and committing to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and technologies.
“However, we do not see any corresponding U.S. response,” he said.
“Without trust in the U.S., there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances there is no way we can proceed with our disarmament first.”
Although Ri has recycled well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, under which North Korea would be rewarded as it took gradual steps, his statements appear to be significant in so far as they do not outright reject the earlier unilateral, contrasting Pydong.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim pledged to work toward “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump offered security assurances to North Korea.
North Korea has sought a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first’ and increases the level of pressure with sanctions to achieve its goal in a coercive manner, even opposing the ‘declaration of the end of the war’,” Ri said.
“The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is an impossible dream of people who know nothing about us.
However, the problem is that the prolongation of sanctions is compounding our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump that had been referred to by the U.S. leader at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, adding: “If the party interested in this issue were South Korea and not the US, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have reached this deadlock.”
Still, the tone of Ri’s speech was drastically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s rockets toward U.S. territory was inevitable after “Mr. President Mau” Trump called Kim the “man of the rockets” on a suicide mission.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year had threatened to “completely destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps toward disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions would have to continue until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a timetable for it, saying "if it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter."
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The implementation of Security Council sanctions must proceed vigorously until denuclearization is complete, final and verifiable.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea imposed since 2006 in an attempt to strangle funding for North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying progress had been made, although North Korea later denounced him for "making gangster demands.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile facility and also a nuclear complex if the United States “takes appropriate measures.”
Pompeo said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” they were seeking were the security assurances Trump took in Singapore, as well as initiatives aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course that teaches them how to rest enough
A new course at Harvard University this year has put all of its students to sleep more, in an initiative to combat the male culture of studying on caffeine-impregnated “straight lines.”
One professor concluded that the students of this university at the top of the world ranking often had no idea about the most basic concepts about the care they should have with themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, was the author of the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the US.
The inspiration for the course came after giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and said, ‘Why are you just telling me this in the last year of the course?’
The young woman said that no one had ever mentioned the importance of sleep to her, which surprised me,” she told The Telegraph.
The course, first taught this year, explains to students the essential concepts about how good sleep habits contribute positively to academic and athletic performance, as well as to improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the institution decided to introduce the course after concluding that some students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section there is an image of a dormitory where students click on coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and about how athletic performance is influenced by sleep deficiency, and the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risks of stroke, depression, and cancer.
Then, a campus map, with interactive icons, encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it won’t change students’ behavior instantly.
However, we believe they have the right to know, just as we all have the right to know the health effects of the smoking option,” added Professor Czeisler.
The culture of pride in “directing” still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students makes this a growing problem.
Ensuring that we get enough sleep and quality should be a “secret weapon” for students to fight stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said, and even to avoid getting fat, as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode, making them constantly starved.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian physics and chemistry student, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes last year in his first year at Harvard.
The course opened his eyes and inspired him to encourage the creation of a course for the entire campus, he said.
The next step, according to their expectations, is to ask all graduate students to attend a similar study program before entering the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommended students to consider using an alarm for bedtime, as well as to wake up, and to be aware of the harmful effects of the "blue light" emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting, which can deregulate the circadian rhythm and lead to problems in adoration.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga goal knocks out Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another bout of grief when Dolly Menga's attack caused Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team a 1-0 defeat at Livingston Stadium.
Ibrox's team was looking to record their first win on their course since winning 1-0 in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team ended up inflicting Gerrard's second loss in 18 games, leaving his team eight points behind the unbridled Hearts, leader of the Scottish First Division.
Menga scored seven minutes before the end of the first half and the uninspiring Rangers collective never seemed to be able to match.
With the Rangers now going down to sixth position, Livingston climbs up to third, and only behind Hibernian for the goal difference.
And even more problems may arise for the Rangers after line prosecutor Calum Spence has received treatment for a head injury caused by an object apparently thrown out of the visitor’s area.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr in the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, for his part, used the same Livingston XI who stole a point from Hearts last week, and will have been delighted with the way his well-oiled team suffocated opponents in each play.
The Rangers may have dominated possession, but Livingston did more with the one he had.
The team could have scored within two minutes, when the first pass sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's beacon, but the average missed his big opportunity out.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs went to meet Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only managed to finish out towards the second beam.
The Rangers managed to regain control, but the hope was greater than belief in their game in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly thought he should have been awarded a major penalty to the quarter-hour with his collision with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson refused the Colombian's appeals.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little to worry about Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's weak end.
Although Livingston's 34th-minute goal may have been contrary to what was expected from the development of the game, it is undeniable that the team deserved it, much less for its tenacity.
Once again, the Rangers failed to cope with Jacobs' long-stop ball throw.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher made a pass to Scott Robinson, who remained calm when he chose Menga for a simple completion.
Gerrard moved in the interval, having replaced Coulibaly by Ryan Kent, and this exchange almost had an immediate impact when the side forward passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly made a sprint from his line to make the block.
However, Livingston continued to force visitors to play exactly the kind of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett making long pass behind long pass.
Holt's team may have increased their lead in the final stages, but McGregor held out well, defending against Jacobs before Lithgow finished out in the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton again claimed a large penalty when he tangled up in Jacobs, but Thomson once again ignored the request.
Almanac: the inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from our Almanac "Sunday Morning": On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and continues to count ... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A fundamental piece of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become a central element of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" in which unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans participated:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When we put these headphones on, we can even hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity on minerals.”
Evans: "Look, it's really cracking now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention to which he gave the name still endures.
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches Immune System to ‘See’ Harmful Cells
New Cancer Vaccine Teaches Immune System to ‘See’ Harmful Cells and Kill Them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Harmful Cells as Part of Treatment
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory
These cells, which can “see” a protein common to many cancers, are then injected back into the body.
An experimental vaccine is producing promising results in patients with a range of cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize harmful cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient and their alteration in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers, designated by HER2. These cells are then injected into the body again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "controls the growth of various types of cancer," including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach involving removing immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.
Kanye West embarks on a diatribe of support for Trump by wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was banished to the studio on Saturday Night Live after an inconsistent performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump, saying he would run in the 2020 presidential election.
After performing his song of the night, titled Ghost Town, in which he wore a "Make America Great" hat, he launched a bravado against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
"So many times I talk to a white man and he says to me, 'How can you like Trump?
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
The SNL began with a satire with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star cut off Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it had not been broadcast, the scene of West's bravado was posted on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to break up with West when he did.
In addition, West had complained to the public that he had spent a bad time behind the scenes because of the hat.
"They intimidated me behind the scenes.
They told me, "Don't go in there with that hat."
I was intimidated!
And then they tell me I’m marginalized,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see marginalization?", saying that "I would wear my super-man cape, because that means no one tells me what to do.
Try the love."
His comments sparked public outcry and SNL participants appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, with someone from the show telling the paper: "The whole studio was completely silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had passed away a few days earlier.
West confused many with the performance of the song I Love It disguised as Perrier's bottle.
West received a rally of support from the director of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who posted the tweet: "To one of our bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR TRYING TO TURBAN."
However, interview show host Karen Hunter posted a tweet saying that West was simply “being what it is, and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose NOT to reward someone (buying their music or supporting their ‘art’) who I believe is welcoming and propagating ideologies that are harmful to the community.
He's free.
And so do we,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, stating that he was now "the previously known Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Also rapper Snoop Dogg has already used the name Snoop Lion and, of course, the missing musical legend Prince changed the name to a symbol and then to "the artist previously known to Prince".
Accused of attempted murder after stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear before the Belfast Court on Monday.
The charges will be investigated by the public prosecutor.
War of the Thrones Star Kit Harington Attacks Toxic Masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, War of the Thrones.
However, the 31-year-old actor attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, stating that such roles on the screen make boys often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
In a conversation with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes "something went wrong" and wondered how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her fellow War of the Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she has a "pretty strong position" on how to approach the problem.
“I have a pretty strong personal position right now: what went wrong with masculinity?” he said.
“What have we been teaching men when they are growing up in terms of the problem we are seeing now?”
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very masculine characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young people feel they have to belong to this particular form of masculinity?
I think this is one of the big questions of our time: how can we change that?
Because clearly something went very wrong for the young people.”
In the interview, the actor also admitted that he would not enter any prequels or sequels of the War of the Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that, for him, the "battlegrounds and the horses" ended.
As of November, Kit will be participating in a reissue of Sam Shepard’s True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he believes finding his wife Rose was the best thing that came out of the War of the Thrones.
“I met my wife in this series, so somehow she gave me my future family and my life from now on,” she said.
Rose played the role of Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple tied the knot in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% jump in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health authorities said.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new cases result from transmissions through sexual intercourse, which marks a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contracted HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, in terms of annual homologous variation, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 people.
Transmission of HIV through sexual intercourse is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community is said to be frequent.
Studies have estimated that, due to the conservative values of the country, 70 to 90% of men who have had sex with other men end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases derive from inadequate sexual protections in these relationships.
The Chinese government has promised since 2003 universal access to HIV medication as part of an effort to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies leaking information about Republican senators by a co-worker and attacks “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her team had posted personal information from three U.S. Senate members on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the accusations were being promoted by opinion leaders and “ultra-right” websites.
“Lies, lies and more despicable lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly includes the addresses and phone numbers of Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a hearing with a Senate panel on allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh, appointed to the Supreme Court.
The leak came some time after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the publications was associated with Waters’ office and published the data of a Waters staff member, The Hill reported.
“This unsubstantiated allegation is totally false and an absolute lie,” Waters said.
“My employee, whose identity, personal data and security were compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations, had no responsibility in this information leak.
This groundless accusation is totally false and an absolute lie.”
Waters' statement quickly drew online criticism, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“That suggests she doesn’t have the temperament to be a Congresswoman.
When someone is accused of something that is not their responsibility, they cannot become angry.
You can't have a challenging attitude.
You can't question the accuser's motives.
It must reveal calmness and serenity.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who had been accused by critics of appearing to be too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who will contest Waters' place in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"Very serious if it's true," he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted "the competent authorities" to these fraudulent allegations.
“We ensure that the culprits will be revealed and will be legally held accountable for all their acts, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and any members of my staff.”
Johnny English's Review Return to Attack - Weak Spy Movie Parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now fashionable to look for connotations with Brexit in any new British-flavored film, and such seems in fact to apply to the new edition of the Johnny English comedy and action film series, which began in 2003 with "Johnny English" and brought back to life in 2011 with "The Return of Johnny English".
Is the ironic self-satisfaction about being so bad the new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his eyes bulging and an overly elastic expression, got his license to create confusion, renewed a second time - with his name to signal, more than anything, that it is a comprehensive comic creation intended for non-English-speaking cinephiles.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to a soft glamour, has a little bit of Cloiseau, a hint of Mr. Bean and something of that bum who contributed a single note to the theme of the movie "Moments of Glory" at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
In addition, his character is originally based on the international traveler and mystery man whose role Atkinson played in the TV commercials for Barclaycard, which left chaos in his wake.
There are one or two interesting moments in this latest edition of JE.
I loved the scene where Johnny English approaches a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, with the rotor blades briefly making a rolling noise against the helmet.
Atkinson's talent for comedy is evident, but the humor sounds weak and strangely superfluous, especially given that editions of "serious" films like the 007 and Mission Impossible now confidently propose comedy as an ingredient.
We get the idea that humor is directed at children and not adults and, in my opinion, Johnny English’s bizarre misadventures are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film numbers in Bean’s character.
Now, the ever-present premise is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker infiltrated the British super-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground to the dismay of the service agent, a woefully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last straw for a prime minister who embodies a pompous and conflicting figure, already suffering from a total breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this role that reminds of Theresa May's character, but the argument does not give much material for big flights.
Her secret service advisers inform her that once all the agents in the asset have been compromised, she will have to take someone out of retirement.
And that someone is the unlucky Johnny English, now working as a teacher in a fancy school, but giving unofficial classes on how to be an undercover spy: here are some interesting numbers, because English offers us a spy academy in the style of the movie "Rock School".
English is quickly taken to Whitehall to receive emergency instructions and rejoin his suffering aide Bough, role played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a submarine commander, a fuzzy character in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit wasted.
Thus, the Batman and Robin of the catastrophe in the Secret Service of His Majesty are back in action, facing the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, role played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being dangerously bewitched by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurdly messy acts: disguised as table employees, they set fire to a flamboyant French restaurant, create confusion by penetrating like clandestines on Volta's luxurious yacht, and English unleashes pure anarchy as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to familiarise himself with the interior of Volta.
All the stops were certainly created in view of this last sequence, but however friendly and stormy it may be, the set has plenty of TV for children.
The result is pretty average.
And as in the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help wondering: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does his talent justice?
Workers deny they are engendering a plan for the British to work four days a week, but getting five.
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party may be considering a radical plan to provide the British with a four-day workweek, but with five paid days.
Reports suggest that the party wants the bosses to pass on the savings with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to the workers, granting them an extra day off.
The workers would get a three-day weekend, but keeping the orderly.
Sources say the idea "would fit" the party's economic program, which reorients the country in favor of the workers.
The passage to a four-day workweek obtained the favorable opinion of the Congress of Trade Unions as a way for workers to take advantage of the changes in the economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: “We look forward to announcing a policy review before the end of the year.
“It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is an aspiration adjusted to the party’s approach to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, as well as the party’s overall strategy for the industrial sector.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party had already proposed a four-day workweek during its campaign for the 2017 legislative elections.
However, this aspiration is not favored at this time by the entire Labour Party.
A party spokesman said: “The four-day workweek is not part of the party’s policy and we are not considering it.”
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used the party’s conference last week to unveil his vision of a socialist revolution of the economy.
McDonnell said he was determined to regain power from the hands of “faceless directors” and “speculators” of basic services companies.
Their plans also include not recovering the full share of the current shareholders of water companies, since the Labour Party may make "deductions" based on the perception of illicit conduct.
McDonnell has also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create inclusive equity funds that transfer 10% of the share of private companies to employees, who will be able to pocket dividends that can amount to <0xC2><0xA3>500 annually.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell '60 Minutes' whether or not the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh can make them change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the findings could lead Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could figure out something that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy proved to be more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
"I said when I went to the hearing, I said, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called you after this happened, when this claim came up, and I asked you, "Did you do it"?
He was determined, determined, unequivocal.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems immutable.
"I am determined as to Brett Kavanaugh and an explosive charge would be required," he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know one thing: Brett made a vigorous denial,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone she mentioned couldn't confirm it.
It was 36 years ago.
I don’t see anything new changing.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Did you do anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York City will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with an extremely impressive list of stars who will act on an equally impressive mission: to eradicate poverty in the world.
Already in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people in the Great Meadow of Central Park, not only to watch performances like those of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the true goal of the event: to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless they are willing to pay for a VIP ticket) spectators had to perform a series of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to a world leader, a phone call, or any other significant ways that contribute to raising awareness of the goal.
However, what has been the degree of success of Global Citizen in these 12 years in achieving its goal?
The idea of rewarding people with a free concert is a genuine way to persuade them to demand action, or is this just another case of “clicketivism” – do we think it makes a difference to sign a petition online or send a tweet?
Global Citizen states that since 2011, it has recorded more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters who have exerted pressure to achieve a number of different goals.
These actions, according to the organization, contributed to world leaders announcing commitments and policies valued at more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements arising from its actions, with at least $10 billion relating to them having already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds obtained so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership bringing together investors and implementers committed to “helping children reach their full potential,” which has pledged to give Rwanda $35 million to help end undernutrition in the country. This after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like all of us, we can make the social injustice of undernutrition a footnote in history,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told a crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 pressure actions on the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced that it would fund a project, Power of Nutrition, which will cover 5 million women and children, with interventions at the level of nutrition.
In response to one of the site’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?”
The Global Citizen replies, “It’s been a long and tortuous road – sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that preceded us, because we are more powerful together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. May Use Navy as ‘Block’ to Put an Obstacle to Russia’s Energy Exports
“If necessary,” Washington can resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s involvement in Syria, in particular, where it intervenes at the invitation of the legitimate government, is a pretext to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy, as they do in Eastern Europe, in the belly of southern Europe," he said.
And, according to the ruler, there are ways and means to prevent it.
“The United States has the capacity, with its navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, to make blockades to ensure that energy does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself “the voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In his speech, he went on to compare Washington’s approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, saying they are effectively the same.
“The economic option in Iran and Russia is more or less to leverage and replace fuels,” he said, referring to Russia as a “magic trick only” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
These statements come at a time when the Trump administration is on a mission to increase natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including the president himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inadequate” Nord Stream pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a “prisoner” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the Nord Stream pipeline, budgeted at 11 billion dollars, intends to double the existing capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project is motivated simply by economic reasons, an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should have the ability to choose suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said in a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position prompted a negative reaction from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s main industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay away from the EU’s energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply,” said Dieter Kempf, the head of the German Federation of Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren “will look deeply” at the possibility of running for president in 2020, Massachusetts senator says
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would “deeply examine” the possibility of running for president following the midterm elections.
During an informal public debate in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he would consider applying.
“The time has come for women to go to Washington to repair our dysfunctional government, and that includes a woman as the maximum responsible,” she said.
“After November 6, I will look deeply into the possibility of running for president.”
Warren commented on President Donald Trump during the informal debate, saying he was "taking the country in the wrong direction."
“I am extremely concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren has been a vocal critic of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll conducted on Thursday revealed that most of Warren’s own constituents are not of the opinion that she should run for president in 2020.
59% of "probable" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a poll by the University of Suffolk/Boston Globe Political Research Center.
32% support his candidacy.
The poll revealed higher support for a candidacy from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% in favor of a potential candidacy and 48% against.
Other prominent Democratic Party names debated regarding a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions the post-traumatic stress of Track Palin at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with a domestic violence incident.
“What my own son is going through, what’s going through after he’s back, I can identify with the other families who feel the ramifications of post-traumatic stress and some of the wounds that our soldiers, in fact, come back with,” he told the audience at a rally in support of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “the elephant in the room” and said his son and other veterans “come back a little different, come back hardened, come back asking if there is that respect for what his fellow soldiers and airmen, and all the other members of the armed forces, have given to the country.”
Track Palin was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman and possession of a gun while drunk, according to Wasilla Police Department spokesman Dan Bennett.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support challenging new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that refuses asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the district sent a statement Friday to amicus curiae (court friends) in Washington, in support of an asylum seeker who is contesting this policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the policy was not disclosed.
The person claimed that her partner "and her children, members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. authorities dismissed her asylum application on July 20.
The complainant was arrested in Texas.
The public ministries that support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigrant Resources Council that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances underlying them; this prohibition violates this principle,” the statement reads.
The lawyers also argued in that statement that the police’s ban on immigrants’ entry negatively affects the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “make the necessary labor available.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gangs in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fears based on ethnicity, religion, nationality or membership of a specific social group or with a particular political opinion,” Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu when the death toll doubles in a counter-clock to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is increasingly desperate.
“The environment is very tense,” said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, mother of a feverish male baby, as she comforted him at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute an ambulance brings in more bodies.
There is a shortage of clean water.”
Residents were spotted returning to their destroyed homes to try to save everything they could find among their water-soaked belongings.
There were hundreds of wounded and hospitals, damaged by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, were overburdened.
Some of the injured, such as Dwi Haris, who fractured his ribs and shoulder, were resting outside Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated abroad due to strong replicas that continued.
His eyes were bathed in tears as he recounted how he felt when the violent earthquake shook him in the hotel room on the fifth floor where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I got stuck in the ruins of the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then, silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of "intimidation" with "advertising"
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid supplement on the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s largest newspaper, after accusing China of seeking to interfere in the Nov. 6 congressional elections, a charge China has denied.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the U.S. election marked the beginning of what U.S. officials, in statements to Reuters, have designated as a new phase in Washington’s growing campaign to pressure China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to issue ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are at this time waging an increasingly intense trade war that has seen both sides impose tariff loopholes on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the early stages of the trade war were designed to affect exporters in states that support Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts say.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, “is now stepping up the pace of this intimidation with the publication of propaganda ads in our free press.”
“With the spread of this propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America’s cherished tradition of free speech and press freedom by publishing a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said.
“On the other hand, in the benches here in Beijing, we find very few dissenting voices and we will never see a true reflection of the disparity of opinions that the Chinese may have of their country’s worrying economic trajectory, as the media is under the firm control of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
In addition, he added that "one of the most prominent Chinese newspapers refused the offer to publish" his article, although he did not mention which one.
Republicans alienate female voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh disaster, analysts warn
At a time when many prominent Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn that this could provoke a negative reaction, particularly from women, during the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the case have been very strong and most Republicans have already publicly stated that they intend to advance to a vote.
These things have no setback,” said The Hill Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute pressure to conduct an FBI investigation would be enough to appease the upset voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday – they won’t forget tomorrow or November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is at the door!” as they demonstrated in the Senate lobby, as Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh’s appointment despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the Mic reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will break all records," Stu Rothenberg, a political analyst with no party affiliation, told the news site.
“People say it’s already high; it’s true.
But it can be even higher, particularly among undecided voters in suburban areas and younger voters, ages 18 to 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony describing his allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that a negative reaction could occur if Republicans moved forward with the confirmation.
“This has become a sham for the Republican Party,” said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee's vote, or whether Kavanaugh will take his place as a judge, it's also about how Republicans handled the matter and how they handled it," Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided on who to believe after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a small majority aligning with the former.
A new YouGov poll found that 41 percent of respondents believed in absolute or likely Ford testimony, while 35 percent said they believed in absolute or likely Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh had likely or absolutely lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s proposal, the FBI initiated an investigation into Ford’s allegations, as well as another accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh sexually molested her when she was 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee exposed his genitals when the two were attending a party during the time they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web intends to create a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has created a startup that aims to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this legendary technology character, Inrupt, is a company that leverages Berners-Lee’s open source platform, Solid.
This allows users to decide where their data is stored and who has access to that information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that Inrupt’s underlying intention is to “dominate the world.”
“We have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid’s technology to allow people to create their own “online personal data warehouse,” or POD.
This may contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify were all available in one browser at a time.
What is unique about the personal online data warehouse is that it is solely up to the user to decide on who has access to what type of information.
The company calls it “personal capacity through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to company CEO John Bruce, is to provide the right resources, processes and skills to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company is currently comprised of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some internal programmers hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, technology creators around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a total change in which all of their business models are turned upside down overnight.
“We are not asking for your permission.”
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that “Inrupt’s mission is to create commercial energy and an ecosystem that helps protect the integrity and quality of the new Web created with Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he created the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate over internet neutrality.
Even as he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: a tribute to a clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross in the First Great War
The only clergyman of the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross during the First Great War as a combatant was honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann obtained the decoration on September 29, 1918 with the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew he received the highest British military honor.
His two grandchildren unearthed a commemorative plaque at a stop in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the plaque had been presented exactly 100 years after the fact that he gave the decoration to his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Saint-Quentin Canal "in a very thick fog and under closed fire of portable weapons and machine guns".
He then ran to the line of fire and, "with the greatest courage", led the line forward before attacking a cannon alone and shooting down three soldiers from the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I know I would never be able to match, but also a lesson in humility.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, deposited a wreath after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he was "very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the courage of a genuine hero is being demonstrated through the support that will be given by many people."
Fans of mixed martial arts wake up all night to watch the Bellator 206 watch Peppa Pig instead
Imagine this: he wakes up all night to see the Bellator 206, full of stars, and in the end is prevented from seeing the main event.
The San Jose series included 13 fights, with six of the main group, and was being aired live overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At six o’clock in the morning, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the confrontation, viewers in the UK were startled when the cover changed to Porca Peppa.
Some were not impressed after they had been awake until dawn especially for combat.
A fan on Twitter described the move to children's cartoons as "a kind of bad-tasting joke".
“Government regulations say that the content is not suitable for six in the morning, so they had to switch to another schedule,” Dave Schwartz, a marketing and communications administrator, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Pepper Pig," yes.
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said the company would rectify the timing of the broadcasts to include UK viewers in the future.
“I think when I think about repetition, I think we can solve the problem,” Coker said.
“But it’s six in the morning on Sunday there and we can’t solve it until our Sunday time, which is Monday in British time.
But we're working on it.
I’m not lying when I say that when the schedule changed, there were a lot of messages exchanged and none very nice.
We were trying to solve the problem, and we thought it was a technical error.
But it wasn’t: it was a government problem.
I promise next time it won't happen.
We will reduce the number of fights to five instead of six, as we normally do. We tried to exceed the expectations of the fans and exaggerated.
It is a regrettable situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt "inferior" to his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley stated that he grew to feel inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that this gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t notice until he entered high school that “not everyone is like me.”
In an interview with Radio 4’s first Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he had spoken out in favor of gay rights to give “hope” to others.
He also said that becoming a father made him worry less about winning the Olympics.
The show's longtime regular presenter, Kirsty Young, took a months off due to illness.
Appearing as a pariah on Laverne's first show, Daley said he felt "inferior" to everyone else because "it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls."
In his words, "to this day, this impression of feeling smaller and different has been the real reason that gave me the power and strength to achieve success."
His goal was to prove that he was “someone,” he said, not to disappoint everyone when they discovered his sexuality sooner or later.
The double Olympic bronze medallist became a prominent LGBT activist and used his participation in this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
According to him, he manifested himself because he felt happy to be able to live openly without consequences and intended to give "hope" to others.
The three-time world champion said falling in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013, “took me by surprise.”
Daley was married last year to the Oscar winner, 20 years older, although he said the age difference was never a problem.
"When we go through it when we're so young" - his first Olympic appearance was at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said, it's hard to find someone the same age who went through similar highs and lows.
The couple had a son last year in June, named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that "all their perspective" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all that mattered was 'winning a gold medal,'" he said.
"But you know, there are things bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.”
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept the fact that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was whether they already had tickets for the 2012 London games because he wanted to be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him you’re not going to be here to be in the front row, Dad,” he said.
“I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it was only when he really stopped breathing and died that I finally recognized that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympic Games and won a bronze medal.
“I was fully aware that it was what I had dreamed of my whole life: diving in front of a crowd of compatriots at the Olympic Games ... there was no better feeling,” he said.
All this was also the inspiration for his first song choice – Proud, by Heather Small – which he had identified with during the preparation for the Olympics, and which still gives him chicken skin.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 a.m.
Mickelson on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Saturday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to regain his form to prevent the milestone from symbolizing an unhappy occasion.
Mickelson, playing at the biennial event for the 12th time, a record attendance, was sent to the bench by Captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has so often been in the United States teams, the five-time main men’s championship winner has split the day between the supporting role and the work in his game on the field, hoping to rectify what is troubling him.
The 48-year-old is not ideal for the Le Golf Nacional course, where the long rough usually punishes the wandering tackles.
And if the field alone wasn’t intimidating enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood, winning all four games they played this week.
If the Americans, with a four-point disadvantage of starting the 12 singles matches, get off to a good start, Mickelson’s match could prove absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, but not that he could assert much more.
“He fully understood the role he had today, patted me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is a respected champion who has given a lot to these teams in the past, and also this week.
I probably hadn't expected to see him play two games.
I thought about more, but that's how it happened and that's how we thought we'd have to move on.
He wants to be in the game, like everyone else.”
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for the most games played in the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never matched the successes of your individual resume.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk has stated that his presence has created some intangible advantages for the team.
“He’s sarcastic, funny and witty, he likes to play with people and he’s a great person to have in the team room.”
“I think the younger players had fun messing with him this week too, which was fun to see.
He gives a lot more than just playing.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows his big advantage could disappear at some point.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that his unfettered leadership as he enters the final day of singles in the Ryder Cup can easily become a bumpy ride.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point lead over the Americans, but crossed the finish line with the narrowest nose, winning by 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
"We always try to remember that we had a considerable advantage in Valderrama; we had a great advantage in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but little," Bjorn said in the image, after watching the 2018 Tour win by 5-3, both on Friday and yesterday at Lederrama.
So history has shown me and everyone on this team that this is not over yet.
Tomorrow, do your best.
Go over there and do everything right.
This doesn't end until we have the points on the scoreboard.
We have a goal that is to try to win this trophy and that is where the focus should remain.
I have always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are well aware of who is on the other side: the best players in the world.
Delighted with the performance of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added: “I would never put myself ahead of this.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
Tomorrow what matters is the individual performances and that involves a different task.
It’s great to be there with a partner when things are going well, but when we’re there on our own, our skills as golfers are tested to the maximum.
This is the message that needs to be conveyed to the players: tomorrow, give your best.
Now they’re going to leave the partner and he has to go and give his best as well.”
In contrast to Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will look for his players to perform better individually than as partners, constituting the exceptions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself was already on both sides of these major upheavals on the last day, having been part of the winning team at Brookline before he ended up losing when Europe took the "Miracle in Medinah" off the card.
“I remember all the words,” he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain in 1999, motivated his players for the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to get that quick start like what you saw in Brookline and what you saw in Medinah.
When this momentum is directed to one side, the pressure is too great in these middle matches.
We organized our squad accordingly and ordered the players the way we feel, you know, that we’re going to try to do magic tomorrow.”
Thomas, with the mission to try to lead the counterattack, faces Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter being the other Europeans in the first half of the standings.
“I chose this group of players in this order because I think it covers the entire route,” Bjorn said of his choices for the singles.
New German warship once again delayed
The latest German Navy frigate should have entered service in 2014 to replace Cold War-time warships. However, it will be necessary to wait at least until next year, due to breakdown-prone systems and an exponentially growing cost, according to local media.
The entry into service of the "Rheinland-Pfalz," the command ship of the newest frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit citing a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the navy in 2014, but the disturbing post-delivery problems undermined the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels the Navy had commissioned in 2007 will serve as a replacement for the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is known that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, as well as a series of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technologies such as the reduction of radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include longer periods between maintenance, which would allow the latest frigates to be sent on missions with a maximum duration of two years away from the ports of origin.
However, the continuing delays have meant that with state-of-the-art warships, considered as a way for Germany to project power beyond borders, they will already be out of date when they enter service, Die Zeit reports.
The unfortunate F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German navy refused to put it into service, having it returned to the Blohm & Voss shipyards in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cite a series of crucial "hardware and software flaws" that would render the warship useless if used in a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, since the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors, only half the contingent needed in the oldest Bremen-class frigates.
It was also known that the vessel is excessively heavy, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to install additional functionalities in the future.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is twice the weight of ships of similar classes used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to hardware failures, the price of the entire project, including crew training, is also becoming a problem.
It is said that this will have reached a staggering 3.1 billion euros, an increase from the 2.2 billion initially budgeted.
The problems facing the latest frigates have become particularly important in light of recent warnings that German naval power is weakening.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary defence committee, acknowledged that the navy is currently running out of ships capable of being used.
The politician stated that the problem has grown exponentially over time, as older ships have been put out of service without there being vessels to replace them.
In the end, he regretted that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were able to join the navy.
National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
New research is being carried out on a property in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how bats use the landscape to search for food.
The results are expected to shed some light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation activities in the future.
The study, conducted by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow common and fruit bats, as well as long-eared chestnuts and Daubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key locations scattered throughout the property to follow the activities of the bats throughout the season.
Mobile studies will also be carried out by NTS staff and volunteers with portable detectors.
Expert analysis of all recordings will assess the frequency of bat calls and what each species is doing.
A habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of your behaviors on a territorial scale.
Rob Dewar, NTS Nature Conservation Advisor, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, as well as the best way to maintain forests for bats and associated species.
Bat populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined considerably over the last century.
These animals are threatened by the construction and development works that affect the dormitories and make the habitat scarce.
Wind turbines and lightning are also a threat, in conjunction with flycatcher papers and some chemical treatments of building materials, in addition to domestic cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, given their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echo location technique to identify insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the region, takes bats very seriously.
The organization has ten trained experts who regularly conduct studies, dormitory inspections, and sometimes rescues.
He also created the first reserve in Scotland dedicated exclusively to bats, on the Threeave property in Dumfries and Galloway, which houses eight of the ten species of Scottish bats.
The property’s director, David Thompson, says the same is the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threeave we have an excellent area for bats,” he said.
“We have the old buildings, a lot of old trees and all this good habitat.
However, there’s still a lot about the bats we don’t know, so the work we’ve done here and on the other properties will help us learn more about what they need to bloom.”
He stressed the importance of checking if there are bats before carrying out maintenance on the properties, because the unintentional destruction of only one maternity dormitory can lead to the death of up to 400 females and young animals, which could eradicate the entire local population.
Bats are a protected species and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their dormitories.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish head of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the public to join in to help.
“We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of our species, we just don’t know how their populations are getting revenge.”
Ronaldo denies rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo characterized the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying that people "want to promote themselves" using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward was accused of raping an American woman, identified as Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
It is alleged that he will then have paid $375,000 to keep the alleged victim quiet about the accident, reads Der Spiegel on Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers hours after the disclosure of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, characterized the reports as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-time Golden Ball winner told the camera.
"They want to promote themselves at the expense of my name.
It's normal.
They want to be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the profession.
I'm a happy man and it's all right," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they characterized as “an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy,” according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would demand compensation for moral damages in the amount corresponding to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious personal rights violations in recent years.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player’s room, where he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents submitted to the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga alleges that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99%" "a good guy", harmed by "one percent".
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sexual relations, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries taken in a hospital, but later agreed to enter into an out-of-court settlement because she felt "terrified by the prospect of retaliation" and was concerned about the possibility of "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman now says she intends to cancel the deal, as she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid, leaving Manchester United at the time of the alleged aggression. This summer he moved to the Italian giants Juve in a deal of 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'would regret forever' losing automakers
The UK “would regret it forever” if it lost its status as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said Secretary for Enterprise Greg Clark.
Clark also said that Toyota in the UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My perspective is that if Britain leaves the EU disorderly at the end of March, we will see production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other carmakers in the UK have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without an agreement on the functioning of cross-border transactions, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, said it would close its Minis factory in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns concern what manufacturers claim to be the risks of the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is managed on a just-in-time basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions at the border, which the sector says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of stock at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, so production would have to stop.
Clark said Theresa May’s “Chequers Plan” for future relations with the EU was “calibrated precisely to avoid these border checks.”
"We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I said, not only the current success, but also the opportunity for us to take advantage of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers points out that we absolutely need to be able to move forward with what has been a highly successful set of supply chains.”
While it could not give an estimate of the downtime, Toyota said that in the long run, the increased costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and could sooner or later lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvalaris, who worked at the Burnaston plant for 24 years and coordinates the Unite union there, said his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, if they are lost, these jobs will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have presented a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed again, White House says
Donald Trump's important meeting with Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed another week" as there is still no understanding of Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed to the Supreme Court, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of legal adviser Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, the links between Trump’s advisers and Russia and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
The fact that Trump may be preparing for the deputy attorney general’s dismissal, thus jeopardizing Mueller’s independence, has fueled rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the information.
But last Monday he moved to the White House, with information that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced on Thursday with Trump, who was at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he would "prefer not to fire" Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid overlap with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh testified and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the final vote in the Senate.
Trump’s press adviser, Sarah Sanders, took part in Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The date has not yet been set, it can be this week but it can also be postponed for another week, in view of everything that has happened in the Supreme Court.
Let's see. I always like to keep the press informed."
Some journalists would not agree with such a statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said the shortage of press conferences is not due to an aversion to the "protagonism" of television reporters, although he said: "I would not disagree with the fact that they like the protagonist."
He then hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president does more question-and-answer sessions than any previous president," he said, adding without adding evidence: "We've looked at these numbers."
The press conferences will continue to take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has an opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, that’s infinitely better than talking to me.
We have tried to do this frequently and have seen that we have done it in recent weeks. The fact that they can talk to the President of the United States replaces any press conference."
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences, when receiving foreign representatives.
Soil press conferences are rare.
This week the President showed why in New York, appearing in a relaxed and sometimes bizarre way in front of the journalists present.
Minister of Health writes to EU workers at Scottish National Health Service about fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish National Health Service to express the country’s gratitude and request that they remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, MSP, sent the letter less than six months after the UK’s departure from the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to costing EU citizens working in the country’s decentralised public services applications for resident status.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continued, with decisions expected for this autumn.
But the UK government has also accelerated preparations for a possible no-deal exit scenario.
I know this is a very unsettling time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reaffirm at this moment how much I value the contribution of each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and from other backgrounds bring valuable experience and skills, which strengthen and improve the work of the health service, benefiting patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we really want you to stay here.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries
Tennessee State Tigers defense, Christion Abercrombie, underwent emergency surgery after suffering head injuries in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, the Tigers' Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee team coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the break.
"He approached the sideline and almost fainted," Reed said.
The technical team and medical staff put Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before laying it on a stretcher and transporting it for further evaluation.
A team representative told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was recovering from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there is still no information on the type/severity of the injury" and that the team is trying to find out when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year student, suspended his studies during the first season with the Tennessee State Tigers after a transfer from Illinois.
He made five home runs on Saturday before leaving the game, bringing his season total to 18.
Higher stamp duty will be charged to foreign buyers when purchasing properties in the UK
The Conservative Party has announced plans to levy a higher stamp duty on foreign buyers who acquire properties in the UK, with additional revenue to be invested in aid to the homeless.
The measure will neutralize Corbyn’s campaign success to attract the younger electorate.
The increase in stamp duty will affect buyers who are not taxed in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless
A higher stamp duty will be levied on foreign buyers who acquire properties in the UK, with additional revenue to be invested in aid to the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract the younger electorate, with promises to provide more affordable housing and tax the higher incomes.
The stamp tax hike will affect people and businesses that are not taxed in the UK, with the additional revenue boosting the government’s campaign to offer a roof to the homeless.
The surcharge - added to the current stamp duty, including the highest levels introduced two years ago for second homes and rental purchases - could amount to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects the measure to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are acquired by non-residents in the UK, driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time home buyers to access the market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost cities" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp duty cut to help young people acquire their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices high by hoarding land they do not use, demanding that Mrs May abandon quotas on affordable housing to solve Britain’s “housing disaster.”
Mr. Corbyn announced an appealing set of housing reform proposals, including rent checks and the end of “no justification” evictions.
It also wants to give the municipalities expanded powers for the construction of new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I stated that I would dedicate my mandate to restoring the British dream that living conditions should be improved for each new generation.
And that means solving the problem of our real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it is not as easy to buy a home for people living outside the UK and for foreign companies as it is for British resident workers.
For too many people, the dream of owning their home has become too distant, and the shame of sleeping in the slumber remains too real.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate ambition is to guide Scotland’
Sunderland coach Jack Ross has said his "last ambition" is to become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old has been successful in the challenge of giving new life to the northeast club, currently third-ranked in the First League, three points from the lead.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after orienting St. Mirren on his return to the Scottish First Division last season.
“I wanted to represent my country as a player.
But I only got a B internationalization," Ross told BBC Sportsound Scotland.
“I grew up watching Scotland play Hampden with my father and these are some of my best memories.
But this opportunity will only come if he succeeds in managing clubs.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coach include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he didn’t feel afraid of succeeding such well-known names in such a large club after rejecting invitations from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"For me, for now, success comes down to 'can I take the club back to the Premier League?'
Considering the structure and facilities of the club, their place is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
"It will not be easy to take the club back, but I will only consider that I was successful here when I achieved that goal."
Ross's career as a coach is only three years, after a stint as Dumbarton's assistant coach and 15 months on the Hearts technical team.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and took St. Mirren from the threat of demotion to the championship title the following season.
Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever felt during his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Taking care of Alloa "was a real crossroads," he recalls.
“I’ve always felt more like a coach than a player.
It seems strange because it went well, I made a living as a player and I had some high moments in my career.
But playing can be very hard.
We face many challenges every week.
I still face them in terms of stress and job pressures, but I feel very good as a coach.
I’ve always wanted to train and now that I do, I feel more comfortable than I’ve ever felt in my adult life.”

The summer heat wave filled British pubs, but put more pressure on restaurant chains.
Restaurant groups saw a 2.7% increase in sales in July, but restaurant occupancy declined by 4.8%, the statistics show.
Peter Martin of CGA, who compiled the statistics, said: "The continuation of the good weather and England's longer-than-expected World Cup career led to the June pattern, in which pubs saw a 2.8% increase in sales, if repeated in July, but restaurants knew one.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant sales in June worsened in July.
Pubs and bars with the beverage-based business far outperformed, with homologous growth that more than offset the drop in restaurants.
Pubs with the business based on meals also experienced difficulties, although not as dramatic as those of restaurant operators.
It seems people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In directly managed pubs and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6% throughout the month, with meals falling 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM leisure and restoration analyst, said: “These results prolong the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The meteorology and the impact of major social and sporting events continue to be the main factors influencing food market sales outside the home.
It is not surprising that the restoration groups continue to face difficulties, although the annual fall in sales of 4.8% is especially harmful when added to the prolongation of the cost pressure.
The long, hot summer couldn't get any worse for operators with the meal-based business. Only time will tell if the milder temperatures we know in August will provide the much-desired relief."
The growth in total sales of pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in brand launch.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, the sector-wide indicator of sales of British pubs, bars and restaurants, collects and analyzes the performance data of 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of more than <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, being recognized as the benchmark of the sector.
One in five children hide secret social media accounts from their parents
One in five children — some as young as 11 — have secret social media accounts that hide from parents and teachers, a study has found.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a growth of “fake” pages on Instagram
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of sexual content
Twenty percent of students said they had a "principal" account to show their parents
One in five children – some as young as 11 years old – create social media accounts that hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed a rapid growth of “fake” accounts on the Instagram photo-sharing site.
The news exacerbates fears about the publication of sexual content.
Twenty percent of the students claimed to have an innocuous “principal” account to show to their parents, while simultaneously owning private accounts.
A mother who found her 13-year-old daughter's secret account found that the teenager was inciting others to "violate" her.
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC Conference of Directors of independent schools, revealed that 40% of young people between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, half of whom admitted to keeping private accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of the athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected non-executive director of the Scottish Athletics Council at the regulator’s annual General Assembly.
Doyle is Scotland’s most awarded athlete. President Ian Beattie has described the appointment as an excellent opportunity for sport regulators to take advantage of his vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is extremely respected throughout the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are confident that Scottish athletics will have a lot to gain from its presence on the board," Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to be able to act as the voice of the athletes and I hope to be able to truly contribute to helping guide sport in Scotland."
The American, who won the 200-meter and 400-meter hurdles at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and a total of four Olympic gold medals, and who is currently a regular commentator on the BBC, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic stroke.
As he wrote on Twitter: "I've had a stroke for a month now.
I stopped being able to walk.
The doctors said only time would tell if he could recover and to what extent.
It has been a painful job but I achieved a total recovery, I re-learned to walk and even do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Milk pump ad compares mothers to cows, sharing opinions online
A milk pump company has shared opinions online with an ad that compares mothers who breastfeed cows in the milkshake.
To mark the launch of what is described as the "first portable silent milk pump", consumer technology company Elvie has released an ironic ad inspired by music videos to highlight the freedom afforded by the new pump to mothers who extract milk.
Four mothers dance in a haystack to the sound of a song that includes verses like "Yes, I'm tidying up, but I don't have a tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, I don't have boobs, these are my breasts."
The chorus continues, "Bomb, pump, feed the babies, pump, pump, I'm milking my girls."
However, the ad posted on the company’s Facebook page generated online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it would allay the "horror" of the dairy industry.
"It's a sad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Just like us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only their babies are stolen from them a few days after they are born.”
The Elvie extraction pump fits discreetly inside a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Comprehensively traumatic for the mother and baby.
But yes, why not use them to announce an extraction pump for mothers who can stay with their babies?”
Someone also said, "An ad with a huge lack of sensitivity."
Others defended the announcement, such as a woman who admitted to finding the song "hilarious".
“I think the idea is great.
If I was still breastfeeding, I'd buy one.
The extraction made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a bit crazy but it makes perfect sense.
This product is great,” wrote one of the women.
Another commented: “It’s a fun ad aimed at mothers who extract milk (often in bathrooms or in the workplace) and feel like ‘cows’.
It's not an ad to praise or judge the dairy industry."
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they were dancing with the discreet bombs housed in the bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the information that many women who extract milk with bombs claim to feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump is completely silent, has no wires or tubes, and fits discreetly inside a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move around, pick up their babies, and even leave home while extracting milk.
Ana Balarin, Partner and Creative Director of Mother, commented: “The Elvie bomb is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By establishing a parallel between women who extract milk and dairy cows we wanted to highlight all the challenges of milk extraction, while presenting in a fun way and with which people can identify the incredible sense of freedom provided by the new bomb.
It wasn't the first time the Elvie bomb was headlined.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded on the catwalk to designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children discreetly moved to Texas border camp
The number of migrant children detained has peaked, although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, in part because the rhetoric and harsh policies introduced by the Trump administration have hampered child sponsorship.
Traditionally, most “parents” are themselves undocumented immigrants, fearing to compromise their own ability to stay in the country by offering to sponsor a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adults who integrate their households would have to record their fingerprints, the data being shared with immigration regulators.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Service, testified before Congress that the service detained dozens of people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The service later confirmed that 70% of the detainees had no criminal record.
“Nearly 80% of the godparents or members of their respective family groups are illegal in the country, many of them foreigners with criminal records.
That is why we will continue to persecute these individuals,” said Mr. Albence.
Seeking to speed up the processing of children, the officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of the date of detention, instead of 60 days, the previous rule, according to the reception center officials.
Many are present by video conference, and not in person, to defend their claim of legal status before an immigration court judge.
Those who are deemed ineligible for aid will be promptly deported.
The longer children remain detained, the more likely they are to feel anxious or depressed, which can lead to violent accesses or attempted escapes, according to staff at the shelters and reports produced by the system in recent months.
Immigrant rights advocates say these concerns are exacerbated in larger facilities such as Tornillo’s, where the large dimension contributes to children’s distress signals being ignored.
They add that the transfer of children to the camps without leaving time for their emotional preparation or to say goodbye to friends aggravates the trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish “occupation forces”
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, despite the country’s war being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "they will be treated as such."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, in a war that has left millions more displaced.
He said Damascus would continue "to wage this sacred battle until we liberate all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers on the ground in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the conditions for their return were assured, accusing “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that led refugees to remain abroad.
“We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no aid to Syria’s reconstruction until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a security zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has created an opportunity to insist on political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement established “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that the military action would target the jihadists, including al-Nusra Front fighters associated with al-Qaeda, who “will be eradicated.”
The United Nations envoy, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria, preparing the ground for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warning against possible interference.
Trump will win a second term.
Under this logic, Trump would be re-elected in 2020, unless, as many liberal observers probably expect, the impeachment and scandals end his presidency in advance.
In what would undoubtedly constitute "the most dramatic end of a presidency ever"!
At the moment, there are no signs of fatigue of the spectators.
Since 2014, prime-time audiences have more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has led cable audiences with up to 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
“This is a strong appeal to people because it’s something we don’t understand,” Neal Baer, producer of ABC’s “Designated Survivor,” said of a chief of staff who becomes president after an attack that destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
He recalled calling a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he was going to vote for Trump.
"Why?" she asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh," Scovell told me.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike television programs, stories from Washington could determine the future of abortion legislation, the right to family reunion of immigrants, and the health of the global economy.
Changing programs is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet, it’s more than just being an informed citizen when we’re watching the sixth hour of an expert debate on Bob Woodward’s use of sources “with deep knowledge” in his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich leather blouse (“a piece of storied clothing full of insolence,” as the Washington Post reports) and the escapades.
I will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
“Part of what he’s done looks like a reality show because he gives us something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, director of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about Trump’s dynamic cast and the plot’s daily twists and turns.
We can't miss a single episode or we're left behind.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week there were 26th on the north coast of Kauai, but he was locked up at home, watching MSNBC while he was recording for CNN.
He didn’t flinch from television as Brett Kavanaugh prepared to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee, with the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
“I still remember when we were doing all those crazy programs and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but they were right after all."

Significant external funding in the mid-term elections for the House of Representatives
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th Circuit is experiencing an influx of funding, thanks to a realignment of the constituencies that left two incumbents in the race for the same seat.
The recent readjustment of suburban circles in Pittsburg put Democrat Conor Lamb in the race, who won his place in another circle in an extraordinary election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's former 12th Circle, which largely overlaps the new 17th Circle.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old circles unconstitutionally favored Republicans.
The race for the 17th round sparked a fierce battle over funding for the campaign between the financial arm of major parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became well-known in Pennsylvania after a tangential victory in the highly contested March extraordinary election for the 18th Pennsylvania Congressional constituency.
This place was occupied more than a decade ago by a Republican and President Donald Trump won in the circle by 20 percentage points.
Analysts have attributed a slight advantage to Democrats.
U.S. considers penalizing El Salvador for supporting China, then withdraws
Some diplomats pointed out that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with few protests from Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners expelled the Trump Organization from the board.
State Department officials have decided to call the leaders of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after "recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan," State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said in a statement this month.
But only sanctions were considered against El Salvador, which received about $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug trafficking control, economic aid and development.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and specific restrictions on visas, would have severely penalized this Central American country with high rates of unemployment and homicide.
With the continuation of the internal meetings, representatives of North and Central America postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity, following a similar meeting last year seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent the entry of immigrants into the United States.
But in mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted the conference to go ahead, setting aside any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence has scheduled an intervention at the conference, now scheduled for mid-October, in a sign of the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, the diplomats said.
The three American representatives discreetly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to talk about internal deliberations covered by anonymity.
His reports were corroborated by an external analyst close to the administration, who also requested anonymity.
Studying History
The next bombshell to be dropped could be the report by legal adviser Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, about which there is currently substantial evidence in the public domain.
Mueller will reportedly be directing his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign conspired with Russia to attack the election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will face accountability from that body, as he prepares to present himself again to voters and perhaps be tried by his peers.
There are many possibilities and I do not want to suggest that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable – nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
There are choices we have to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the fight.
In 1938, some German officers were prepared to depose Hitler in a coup d'état, as long as the West had resisted and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around turning points like this, in which the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or stalled.
Americans are currently facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been under threat since this newspaper reported that last year he suggested secretly recording the president, speculating about his inability to hold office.
Rosenstein says the news from The Times is incorrect.
“How will we respond if the newly requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not fair and complete or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fall into these tests, democracy will be about to cross a long desert.
But I believe that we will not fail, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my diplomatic residence.
She survived, she immigrated to America, and 60 years later, she sent me to light Sabbath candles on that swastika table.
With such a legacy, how could it not be optimistic about our future?”

Graham Dorrans of the Optimist Rangers before the game with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers receive the Vienna Rapid on Thursday, knowing that a victory over the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain with Villarreal at the beginning of the month, will leave them in a good position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented the average Graham Dorrans from making the first game of the season until the two-goal draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers will be able to use this result as a springboard for higher flights.
“It was a good point for us because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We faced the game with a positive mindset and we scored a point.
Maybe we could have won close to the end, but overall, the draw was probably the fairest result.
They were probably better in the first half but we went around and dominated in the second half.
Thursday will be another great European night.
I hope that we can win all three points. It will be a difficult game because they got a good result in the last game but, with the support of the public, I am sure that we will do our best to achieve a positive result.
The last year has been very tough, with all my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now there is a good environment.
The team is good and the players are having fun; the training is going well.
I hope we can do our best, forget about the past and achieve success.”
Women are losing sleep with fear of this savings-reform account
Despite the fact that the participants in the survey have a clear idea of the type of care they intend to enjoy, few people have spoken to their relatives about the matter.
About half of the individuals surveyed in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of continued care.
Only 10% mentioned talking to their children about the same subject.
“People want a family member to take care of themselves, but they’re not having that conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
Here's how to get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare your family for care if you do not let them know your wishes in advance.
Work with your consultant and your family, discussing where and how to receive care, as these choices can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Involve your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Your continuing care financing choices may include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a hybrid policy with monetary valuation to help cover these expenses, or financing using your own savings, as long as you have these values available.
Prepare the legal documentation: Avoid legal battles.
Appoint a health care attorney by choosing a person of your trust to oversee your health care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are prevented from communicating them.
Consider also the establishment of a power of attorney over your finances.
You should select someone you trust to make the financial decisions for you, ensuring that your bills will be paid if you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent suffers a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medication and allergies?
Include this information in a written plan to be prepared.
“It’s not just financial issues at stake, but who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What is the medication?
Who will take care of the dog?
Prepare that plan.”
Man shot multiple times with air pressure in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air pressure upon returning home after a night in the city.
The victim, in her 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was hit in the chest, abdomen and hand.
The officers described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The injuries are not life-threatening and the police have requested witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a strong earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications interrupted, rescuers were unable to obtain any information from the Donggala region, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a region that stretches along more than 300 km of coast, in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The region, with administrative status lower than that of a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main economic activities of the Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel extraction is also important in the province, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past hundred years, according to Indonesia’s disaster management agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Seismic Fire, and is regularly struck by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, in northern Sumatra, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on Nias Island, off Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that struck off the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people have died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami with waves up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the Pidie Jaya region of Aceh, spreading destruction and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died buried under the rubble of the buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquakes destroyed thousands of buildings, leaving thousands of tourists temporarily isolated.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, a resident of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in an investigation into domestic violence and resistance to detention, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska police.
According to the police report, when a friend tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he took her phone off.
Palin is pre-trially detained at the Mat-Su pre-trial detention center, subject to a $500 bail, KTUU reported.
He was present at the judge's hearing on Saturday, declaring himself "obviously innocent," the station reported.
Palin faces charges for three Class A crimes, which means he could be sentenced to up to a year and fined $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B felony, punishable by a day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is being tried by the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interference in reporting a crime of domestic violence and possession of a gun under the influence of alcohol, in relation to the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of smacking her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veterans’ associations for associating her son’s violent behavior with post-traumatic stress from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have been cut, with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck the region of Sulawesi Central, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
They stream videos on social media showing the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecutor Calls for Rare Capital Punishment for Suspected Terrorist Attack in New York
The New York Public Prosecutor’s Office is asking for the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in the city – a rare penalty that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a truck rented by Home Depot to carry out an attack in October on a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, overrunning pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and inflicted "intentionally" serious injuries, according to the death penalty notification, filed in the South Zone of New York.
Both charges can be punished with the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal court jury charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including eight counts of murder in the service of organized crime, normally used by the Public Prosecutor’s Office in cases of organized crime, and one charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required "considerable planning and premeditation," prosecutors said, describing how Saipov executed him as "atrocious, cruel and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused injuries, damage and loss to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco," the notification said.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
For a decade, the Southern Zone of New York has not asked for the death penalty for an indictment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953, when the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit acts of espionage in favor of the Soviet Union, two years earlier, during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, did not show any remorse in the days and months that followed the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he had been inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested permission to hang the ISIS flag in the hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s defense lawyers, said they were “obviously disappointed” with the prosecution’s decision.
“We think that the decision to ask for the death penalty instead of accepting a confession of guilt for life without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma associated with these events for everyone involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the accusers not to ask for the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed today to "mobilize the popular army" during a protest at the Conservative Congress.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should "feel the pressure" from Euroskeptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should lead negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a rally in Birmingham that the UK “would have already left” if Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge faced by Mrs May to reconcile her deeply divided co-religionists has been underscored by the conservatives defending permanence, who have staged a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister has been debating to keep her compromise plan, known as the Chequers Plan, in the face of attacks from Brexit supporters, stay-at-home advocates and the EU.
The allies insist that she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the protests, forcing Euroskeptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and the "chaos".
Mr Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he intended to "end the Plan".
Bone suggested that responsibility should have been given to Farage in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible, we would have left already,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will continue to defend Brexit but we should end the Plan.”
Reinforced his opposition to the EU, he declared: "We did not fight in two World Wars to be subservient.
We want to make the laws of our own country.”
Bone denied the allegations that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: “The idea that the British people have changed their minds and intend to stay is totally misguided.”
Conservative Brexit campaigner Andrea Jenkyns also took part in the rally, telling reporters: “I’m just saying, Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers Plan is unpopular with the public, the opposition will not approve it, it is unpopular with our own party and with the militants who take the campaigns to the streets and to whom we owe our election.
Drop the Chequers Plan and start listening."
In a message to Mrs May, she added: “Only prime ministers who know how to keep promises keep their jobs.”
Farage said at the rally that politicians should "feel the pressure" if they are prepared to betray the decision to leave the 2016 referendum.
“This has become a matter of trust between us – the people – and the political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and we’re here today to tell them they’re not going to get away with it.”
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want them to pressure our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit.
We want to mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and that will not rest until we become an independent, proud and self-governing UK.”
However, supporters of the stay marched in Birmingham before organizing a two-hour rally in the city centre.
Crowds of activists took to the streets with the message "Conservatives against Brexit" following the group's launch this weekend.
The Labour representative in the House of Lords, Andrew Adonis, criticized the Conservatives for the security issues they faced with a party application at the opening of the congress.
“It is these people who tell us that they will have the computer systems and all the technology ready for ‘More Canada’, for the frictionless border, for free borderless trade in Ireland,” he added.
It's a complete hoax.
There is no good Brexit,” he concluded.
Warren plans to "seriously" consider running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will “seriously weigh the presidential candidacy” after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a debate in that state on Saturday.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, co-chairman of Trump’s 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
It has been speculated that he may face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in debate format since Trump’s inauguration.
One of the participants asked him if he planned to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it’s time for “women to go to Washington to fix our government’s problems and that includes a woman in the top spot.”
Arrest in connection with the murder of Wayde Sims, the LSU Tigers
Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police announced Saturday the arrest of a suspect in the case of the murder of LSU Tigers basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
Police had released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help in identifying a man seen in the images.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus early Friday.
“Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died,” police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde defended a friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted his presence at the scene, wielding a gun, acknowledging that he had targeted Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken to the East Baton Rouge Parish police station.
Sims, a 1.98-meter junior raised in Baton Rouge, played 32 games and was the starter for 10 times last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title with a win over Sebastian Vettel following team orders
It became clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified in front of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that team orders at Mercedes would play a central role in the race.
Leaving pole position, Bottas had a good start and left Hamilton behind in defending his position in the first two corners, allowing Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel went first in the pits and made Hamilton have to face the traffic from the end of the platoon, which could have been decisive.
Mercedes went into the pits one lap later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton overcame him after a bludgeoned skirmish, after which the Ferrari driver reluctantly left the inside of the track free, at risk of disqualification after a double trajectory correction to defend himself in the third corner.
Max Verstappen came out of the last row of the grid and was in seventh place at the end of the first lap, on the day of his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race, changing tyres too late, which would allow him to be quick in the final, aiming to overtake Kimi Raikkonen to finish fourth.
He ended up coming to the pits in the 44th lap but failed to improve his pace in the last eight laps, which allowed Raikkonen to finish fourth.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job over the whole weekend and he was a real gentleman, letting me overtake him.
The team did an exceptional job, which allowed us to finish in the first two positions," Hamilton said.
Poor body language
President Donald Trump ridiculed Sen. Dianne Feinstein at a rally on Saturday over her insistence that she did not reveal a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the President did not directly refer to Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, commenting instead that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “bad, malicious and fake.”
“Look at the beautiful thing that’s going on in the Senate in the last few days, look at the anger, look at how bad, malicious, and false people are,” Trump said.
"When we see the leaks and the communiqués and when they say 'oh, it wasn't me.
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did the escape start with you?
Do you remember her response... did you release the document? - 'Oh, what, what?
Oh, no.
The escape didn't leave me.'
Well, wait there.
The escape started from us... No, it wasn’t us,” she added, mimicking the senator.
Feinstein received the letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh sent by Ford in July and the escape occurred in early September, but denied that the escape had left his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t reveal his story,” Feinstein told the commission, according to The Hill.
"She asked me for confidentiality and I complied with her request."
But his denial did not convince the President, who commented during Saturday night's rally: "You know what, that was bad body language.
It may not have been her, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen."
Continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, accused of sexual abuse by three women, the President suggested that the Democrats would be using the charges in his favor.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
We see evil, malice, it doesn’t matter who can hit, who has to step in to take power and control,” the president said.
First Division: Dundee Stars beat Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars recovered from Friday's loss in the First Division game against the Belfast Giants, winning the second hand 5-3 on Saturday in Dundee.
The Giants got an initial two-goal lead with finishes from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie tied for the home team before Dwyer put the Giants back in front.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard tied for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals secured the team's victory.
It was the third loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who had achieved a turnaround on Friday night in Belfast, defeating Dundee 2-1.
It was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) following an assist from Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford watching for Beauvillier increase the lead four minutes later.
In a frantic first period, Sullivan put the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt gave the draw to Cownie at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured that the Giants reached the first break in the lead, scoring their second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team reorganized and Bouchard tied again with a powerful goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined efforts to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game at the end of the second period, securing victory by scoring the team's fifth goal in the middle of the last period.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in the next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller dies to help hundreds of passengers escape earthquake
An Indonesian air controller has been hailed as a hero after he died by ensuring a plane with hundreds of passengers took off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many remain missing after a strong earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Powerful replicas continue to haunt the region, leaving many residents buried in the rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing to save themselves, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post while the control tower violently blew up at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri airport in Palu.
It remained focused to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was then on the runway, took off safely.
He then jumped from the control tower, in the face of the eminent collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Indonesian air navigation agency spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian broadcaster ABC News reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan to evacuate him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“We were devastated by this news,” he added.
However, authorities fear the death toll could reach thousands, referring to the country’s disaster management agency that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The balance is increasing, since there are many bodies buried by the debris that we have not yet been able to rescue," said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves of up to six meters devastated Palu, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft are transporting aid and supplies to the site.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute there are ambulances with bodies.
Lack of drinking water.
The minimarkets are being looted all over the place.”
Jan Gelfand, head of Indonesia’s International Red Cross, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is in a race against time to help survivors, but we don’t know what we’re going to find.
The current situation is really tragic, but it could be much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday. According to CNN sources, he addressed the military forces at the site and said:
"I ask you to work day and night to complete the evacuation operations. Are you ready?"
Earlier this year, the island of Lombok in Indonesia was hit by earthquakes that claimed the lives of more than 550 people.
Plane crashes in Micronesia: Air Niugini now informs that there is a missing man after plane crash in the lagoon
The airline responsible for the plane that crashed in a lagoon in Micronesia, Pacific, now reports that there is a missing man after he reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued safely from the sinking plane.
In a statement, Air Niugini said it had been unable to confirm the whereabouts of a male passenger since Saturday afternoon.
The company said it was collaborating with hospitals, investigators and local authorities to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local vessels helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said six passengers remained hospitalized on Saturday, all of them with a stable clinical picture.
It is not yet certain what caused the fall or the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy were unanimous in stating that the plane failed to reach the runway and fell in love with the lagoon.
Some witnesses thought the plane was off-track.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane was too low.
"It was the best thing that ever happened," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other people had managed to drag themselves with the water around their waists and arrive at the plane’s emergency exits to sink.
He told me that the flight attendants had panicked and started screaming, and that he had suffered a small head injury.
According to the U.S. Navy, sailors who were working on a nearby mooring improvement project also helped in the rescue by resorting to an inflatable boat to transport people to land before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) deep.
Based on data collected by the Aviation Safety Network, over the past two decades, 111 people have died in accidents with registered airlines of PNG, but none involved Air Niugini.
Analyst explains chronology of the events of the night when a woman was burned alive
The indictment concluded its claims on Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowllet, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert in the field of information analysis.
He described to the jury how he used the phone records to reconstruct the movements of 20-year-old defendant Quintom Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamber on the night of his death.
According to the Clarion Ledger newspaper, Rowlett claimed to have obtained location data from several mobile phones confirming that Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting the statements he had previously made.
When the data showed that his phone was with Chambers at the time he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to speak with Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and stated that he had not been in the city that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth by stating that he was in his van that night, Sanford replied that he was lying because the van was in Nashville.
Another incongruity in Tellis' testimony pointed to the fact that he claimed to have known Chambers about two weeks ago when she died.
Mobile phone records indicated that they only knew each other a week ago.
Rowlett stated that, some time after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' SMS messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"You erased her from your life," Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin filing its final claims on Sunday.
The judge said he hoped the trial would begin to be reviewed by the jury at the end of that day.
The High Breed: What is Conscious Hip Hop?
A hip hop trio wants to change the negative tone of the genre by filling their music with positive messages.
Bristol’s The High Breed group claims that hip hop has strayed from its roots of political orientation and social criticism.
They want to go back to those roots and return popularity to conscientious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have witnessed a recent renaissance in the UK thanks to the intervention of other performers such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York lover sues couple for firing via "racist" SMS
A New York mother-in-law is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after she mistakenly received an SMS message from her mother complaining that she was “another black.”
The couple denied the accusations of racism, saying the trial was an act of "extortion".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two children, showed some fear when she discovered that the new mistress Giselle Maurice was black when she showed up for her first day of work in 2016.
“I CANNOT BELIEVE... ANOTHER BLACK,” Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in an SMS message.
However, instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to Giselle Maurice... twice.
According to the New York Post, when she noticed her gaffe, a "embarrassed" Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice, alleging the poor performance of the previous African-American mistress who was waiting for a Filipino mistress.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her only day of work and sent home from Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple and seeking a $350/day lay-off compensation for the six-month period for which she had been chosen without a contract.
“I want to show them that they can’t go unpunished,” he told the Post on Friday, adding, “I know this is discrimination.”
The couple refuted the allegations of racism, saying that firing Giselle was perfectly logical given that they feared they could not trust her after offending her.
“My wife sent him something he didn’t really want to say.
It's not racist.
We are not racist people,” Joel Plasco told the Post.
"Would your children trust someone who had treated them badly, even if by mistake?
Your newborn son?
I don't believe it."
Calling the process “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had been a mother only two months ago and had to deal with “a very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to chase someone like that?
It’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
While the legal process is ongoing, the court of public opinion has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing their behavior and reasoning.
New letter reveals Paddington publishers feared readers might not identify with a talking bear
Karen Jankel, daughter of Bond, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, commented on the letter: “It’s hard to put ourselves in the shoes of someone who first read it before it was published.
It's really fun to get to know this now, after Paddington has been so successful."
He said his father, who worked as a BBC camera operator before being inspired by a little play bear to write the children's book, would not have breastfed if the book had been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication had a bittersweet taste given his passing last year.
About Paddington, who he described as “a very important member of our family,” he said his father was very proud of the success achieved.
“He was a modest man and not a person given to gabarolice,” he said.
“But as Paddington was so real to him, it was like he had a successful son: we were proud even when the deed wasn’t ours.
I think that's how I saw Paddington's success.
Despite being the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on my cell phone.
Soon after landing, the daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors fought in vain to save her life.
“Nad would often call to say that the situation was really bad and that there was no chance of survival,” Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“So Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
That's what I did.
She said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear.
We'll be together soon.
Together.
The medications that doctors had given him to keep his heart working were slowly failing to take effect and leaving his system.
He had already died some time ago and all his organs were stopping.
I had to stay there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or complain because I was surrounded by families and people.
I had to contain myself."
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane along with other passengers outside the ordeal she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
“I’ve always cried with my head down.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt enormous compassion for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Women in mourning post cards on bridge to prevent suicides
Two women who have lost loved ones who have committed suicide struggle to keep others from following the same path.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted cards on a Welsh bridge with motivational messages and phone numbers that people can use to receive support.
Tyler, the son of Sharon Davis, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any father to have to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Sharon Davis, 45, a Lydney resident, said the son was a promising boss with a contagious smile.
“He was known for his smile.
Everyone said it lit up the room.”
However, he gave up work before he died because he had "dipped into the darkness."
In 2014, Tyler was found dead by his 11-year-old brother.
Sharon Davis said, “I’m always worried about a possible repercussion.”
Sharon Davis created the postcards "to let them know that there are people who are available to help and who they can talk to, not even that they are a friend.
Don't shut yourselves up, they have to talk."
Kelly Humphreys, longtime friend of Sharon Davis, lost her 15-year-old partner Mark shortly after her mother-in-law's death.
“I didn’t say I was sad or depressed,” he said.
“A few days before Christmas we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, there was a rag. When the kids opened the presents, he didn't even look at them."
He said his death traumatized them a lot, but it’s something they have to overcome: “Destroy a family.
No one is indifferent.
But we all have to keep living and fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh’s future is at stake with the FBI’s investigation
“I thought that by having the same thing as I had asked for – an investigation with defined time and scope – we could be more united,” Jeff Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the commission was “breaking down” in the face of an entrenched partisan deadlock.
Why didn't Brett Kavanaugh and his Republican backers want the FBI to investigate?
Their reluctance is merely a temporary matter.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away. On November 6, if, as expected, Republicans have poor results, they will see their attempts to elect their candidate to the Supreme Court frustrated.
George W. Bush has contacted senators to pressure them to support Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House for Bush and through whom he met Mrs. Ashley, Bush’s personal secretary at the time.
What happens after the FBI files your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not certain that Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to cast the tie-breaker vote and confirm his place in the Supreme Court.
North Korea's number of defectors declines during Kim's regime
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to North Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un's rise to power seven years ago.
Citing data from South Korea’s Unification Ministry, Park Byeong-seug said there were 1,127 desertions last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as the fact that people smugglers were asking for more money, were the main factors.
Pyongyang did not make any public statements.
As a general rule, South Korean citizenship is granted to the vast majority of defectors in North Korea.
Seoul has reported that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal migrants and non-refugees, and they are often repatriated.
Relations between North and South Korea (technically still at war) have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the denuclearization negotiations that are at an impasse.
The talks came after the historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, during which they agreed, broadly speaking, to collaborate in the creation of a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. for a lack of progress.
“Without confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security and under these circumstances it is impossible for us to take the first steps towards unilateral disarmament,” Ri said in a speech at the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is hysterical and unfit to serve on Supreme Court
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh was hysterical and temperamentally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview given Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help thinking that if a woman had behaved like this, she would soon be called hysterical," Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all sexual abuse legations to Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh made a statement of emotional openness, sometimes in a loud and reassuring voice, when talking about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly accused the committee’s Democrats, calling the allegations made against him a “grotesque and conspiratorial murder” organized by liberals angered by Hillary Clinton’s loss of the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he is not fit to serve on the Supreme Court given his prejudicial behavior against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
When asked if he would try to challenge Kavanaugh's effective nomination and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives, Pelosi hesitated.
“What I can tell you is that lying to Congress or the FBI does not qualify you to be on the Supreme Court, not even to serve in your current court,” Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge at the Circuit Court of Appeals in D.C.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he feared Kavanaugh’s potential views against the Affordable Care Act (better known as Obamacare) or the Roe vs. Wade case, given the fame of being a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh bypassed questions about the possibility of repealing certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not a time to elect someone hysterical and prejudiced to the Supreme Court and expect us to be happy with the decision," Pelosi said.
Women need to be able to control their emotions.
It’s a justified diatribe, months and years of fury overflowing, and it can’t pour out without crying.
"We cry when we get angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, do you?"
A woman with an executive position in any company helped me immensely. She told me that she also cried when she got angry, but had created a technique. When she got angry and started crying, she told the person she was talking to, "Don't think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm angry."
And it went on.
And I thought to myself... it's brilliant," Mrs. Steinem continued.
Tears are accepted when they express anger because, in a more common context, they are misinterpreted.
I remember perfectly well, in an old job in a male-dominated office in which I cried inexpressible anger, being grabbed by the neck by an older woman—a not-so-friendly manager who terrified me a little—and literally dragged up the stairs to hear her say
"Never let them see you cry."
"They don't know if you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be happy that they’ve been able to affect you.”
Patricia Schroeder, a Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Gary Hart was caught in an extramarital relationship aboard a boat called Monkey Business and dropped out of candidacy, an extremely frustrated Patricia Schroeder didn’t see why she couldn’t run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” he told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates and one more was simply unnecessary.
There was someone who dubbed the situation "The Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Given his late entry, fundraising was far from desirable and he swore that he would only enter the race if he managed to raise $2 million.
A battle doomed to defeat.
He found that some of his supporters would only give him $250, although they had given $1,000 to male candidates.
"Do you think I'm entitled to a discount?" he asked.
When she announced that she would not enter a formal campaign, emotions came to the top – gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that raises so many obstacles to fundraising and send the message to voters instead of delegates, and anger against sexism – and tears came.
“It even looked like I was depressed,” Patricia Schroeder recalled when speaking about the media’s reaction.
“I would have thought Kleenex was my business sponsor.
What would you write in my epitaph?
"Did she cry?"
How the U.S.-China Trade War Could Be Beneficial for Beijing
The first bailout of the U.S.-China trade war has been deafening, and while the end of the conflict is not in sight, experts believe the two countries’ departure may be beneficial for Beijing in the long run.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning earlier this year by taxing important Chinese imports that include solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week saw a significant worsening of the situation with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), effectively taxing half of all goods shipped by China to the U.S.
Beijing has always retaliated in the same currency, recently raising rates from 5 to 10 percent for US goods worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to follow in the footsteps of the U.S. and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will waver in the coming times.
Taking Washington back would mean succumbing to the demands, but showing public subservience to the U.S. would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, President of China.
However, experts say that if Beijing makes good use of its assets, the pressures imposed by the trade war with the U.S. can positively sustain China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“In reality, the fact that an untimely political decision by Washington or Beijing could result in an economic crisis in both countries is far more dangerous than observers could ever have anticipated,” said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher on the Asia study at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
Foreign Minister says Syria is ready for the return of refugees
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild a country devastated by more than seven long years of war.
In his address to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem stated that the country's conditions are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
There are now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country who have left due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that have affected their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people who have remained in the country are in need of humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would gladly receive aid for the reconstruction of the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional assistance or aid from the countries that sponsored the revolt.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team beats the USA and wins the 2018 Ryder Cup with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now racked up six consecutive defeats on European soil since they last won the Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe is once again crowned victorious after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn hit the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who proved to have serious difficulties during almost the entire tournament, threw the starting tee into the water in hole 16, par 3, giving the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari shone in all his rounds, becoming 1 of 4 players to get 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to the worst-ranked player in the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, has lost 2 and 1 to England's Ian Poulter in what may have been his last Ryder Cup appearance.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spanish Sergio Garcia became the most awarded European of all tournaments with 25.5 career points.
“It’s not my habit to cry, but today I couldn’t contain myself.
It's been a rough year.
I can't help but thank Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy we won the cup.
It was all a team effort and I’m happy to have been able to help,” said an emotional Garcia after Europe’s victory.
Pass the word to your compatriot Jon Rham who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods for 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"It's impossible to describe the pride I feel for defeating Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him play," Rahm, 23, said.
Woods has lost all four games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Unusual statistical values of one of the greatest players of all time with 14 great titles won and only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau who had a high-calibre performance throughout the tournament, the rest of the U.S. national team struggled to get to the fairway.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team's disappointing performance. "I'm proud of them. They fought.
This morning, we managed to put some fear into Europe.
Let's fight.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All of his 12 players were excellent.
We will reorganize and collaborate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Commission to move forward.
I like a lot of these 12 players and am proud to be their captain.
I have to take the hat off to the other team.
They were better."
