Parliament did not support the amendment liberating Tymoshenko
Ukraine’s parliament has rejected a proposal to repeal a paragraph of the Criminal Code amendment condemning opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
At the second reading, MEPs rejected the amendment that would pave the way for the release of the jailed ex-prisoner.
Tymoshenko was sentenced in October to seven years in prison for entering into an allegedly unfavourable contract with Russia for the purchase of natural gas.
The judgment is not final, the appeal of the convicted is to be discussed by the court in December.
Tymoshenko refers to the verdict as a political vendetta of the regime, suspicion of court bias has triggered the trial in the West as well.
The proposal to remove section 365 from the Criminal Code, on the basis of which the ex-minister was convicted, was supported by 147 MPs in the vote.
It took 226 votes to pass.
Category: Libyan victories
The story of the Libyan liberation, or Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him is after the war.
It remains to define the winner.
As is the custom in the region, Islamists will win the elections, but it is a question of whether moderation or radical.
The Transitional National Council has signed up to the customary Sharia law and we already have an idea about it.
Libya will become a crime-free country, as a hand is cut off for theft.
Women can forget about emancipation, any apostates from the faith are awaiting execution and so on.
Instead of being a dictator, a society made up of rival tribes will unify the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine and that we certainly do not want.
But our way of life is neither the only nor the objectively best, and it would probably not suit the Libyans mentioned above for a change.
In fact, it is surprising that Islamic fighters have taken a goodbye with the help of non-believer dogs.
They are sorry only for the fact that from their point of view, the NATO airstrikes were not led by a general from America, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated with every intervention.
So when the victors are sought in Libya, the West does not belong among them.
We took part in the shootings, we served Islam, and our politicians got rid of a political ally in the person of the dictator, without any guarantee of profit.
After recent bad experiences from Afghanistan and Iraq, we are not militarily occupying Libya.
Thus, the problem with the expulsion of "cruisers" is eliminated by the local authorities.
But will they have Libyan black gold without the occupation of the oil company?
There may not be enough, and the West will finally be able to boast of the unprofitable protection of human rights.
Unless, of course, we're told by the Shariah law.
A new era of crisis is beginning.
France and the rest of Europe have come to the forefront of investors
On Tuesday, the statistical shrinkage overtook Europe.
Individual countries have published GDP data for 3Q.
The Czech economy has stagnated between quarters, Germany and France are growing.
Today, the bond market is breaking records.
Investors no longer look only at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical authorities of the euro area, Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries of Europe have published preliminary estimates of the development of the economy for the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by an expected 0.5%, France by 0.4%.
Both countries were also adjusting data for the second quarter, in which Germany was next better than expected (0.3% growth instead of the original 0.1%), but France said it appeared in a slight decline of 0.1% (original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, the gross domestic product (GDP) stagnated in the quarter and, according to <0xC4><0x8C>S<0xC3><0x9A>, confirmed the trend of gradual slowdown in economic performance growth.
The results are worse than analysts’ estimates.
The most important events:
The Czech economy grew by 1.5 percent year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, but stagnated in the middle of the year.
According to preliminary and seasonally recalculated data, the German economy grew by 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
The economy of the euro area and the European Union grew by 0.2 percent between July and September compared to the previous quarter, which is in line with analysts’ expectations.
The Greek economy declined by 5.2 per cent year-on-year.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The yields of Italian and Spanish bonds are rising to critical levels.
Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc. are also starting to experience problems...
The yield on Czech 10-year bonds is below 4%, although the situation in the region is deteriorating.
There are rumours from Germany that the ECB should be the lender of last resort.
The Czechs qualified for the Euro.
They won 1-0 in Montenegro and celebrate the progress for 200 million
The football team managed the most difficult task of the season!
In Montenegro and thanks to the great Czech and the beautiful brand Petr Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek won 1: 0.
Czech football, even with a great deal of luck in the second half, has earned a luxurious lead from home vengefulness and will not be missing again at the European Championship.
IHNED.cz followed the progress match in a detailed report.
Almost no excitement in the first half and a great deal of luck in the second.
The Czech national team also won 1-0 in Montenegro thanks to a domestic nightmare in the final, the great Czech and the hero Jir<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, and celebrates progress to the European Championships.
The Montenegrins did not come under pressure until the second half due to the precise defence of the Czech Republic.
The pitchers of the match became Damjanovi<0xC4><0x8D> with Vucini<0xC4><0x8D>, who burned two big chances.
Thanks to the great Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and the prize money of around CZK 200 million will be added to the national football fund.
A lot of football has been played since the beginning.
Both teams found it difficult to get involved in the combination and played mostly around the halfway line.
The pressure of domestic footballers did not come in the first half either, long kicks for the defense because the Czech defense accurately deflected.
Iranian students are prepared to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They created a living shield.
Several hundred college students have created a living shield around a nuclear facility in Iran.
In their gesture, they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
The students prayed in front of the facility on Tuesday afternoon and then called for the deaths of the US and Israel.
Several hundred students from universities in Isfahan, Iran, created a live shield around the Isfahan Nuclear Technology Center, which processes uranium, on Tuesday.
They show that they are prepared to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a recent report that Iran appears to have continued to pursue nuclear weapons.
There is talk of a possible attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities in Israel.
The students prayed at noon before entering the Isfahan nuclear facility and then called for the deaths of America and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at eroding Iran’s nuclear program as much as possible, the Israeli press said that, in addition to the Isfahan center, a facility in Natanz that enriches uranium would also be targeted.
Obese child's dining room: breakfast and dinner snacks
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 have problems with overweight, with 9 percent of schoolchildren being overweight and 5 percent of children being obese.
Obese children, on the other hand, mostly come from families with unhealthy lifestyles, according to a recent survey.
Again, it shows how important it is for the healthy development of the human environment in which it grows and the patterns that surround it.
On the tables of obese children, for example, sausages appear up to half more often than in families of children with normal weight.
Fried fries had to dinner the day before the research associated with an educational event called Obesity is no coincidence more than 19 percent obese.
In fat families, too, it is not a habit to exercise, which is true for most families of today’s schoolchildren – only 15 percent of children said that their parents would find time to exercise at least once a week.
A survey of 900 children
The survey took place at the end of last year’s school year and was attended by almost 900 children from primary schools across the Czech Republic.
It was already the second year of the Obesity event not a coincidence, which is supported by the General Health Insurance and Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 students from 4th to 8th grade have participated in the project.
Proper nutrition and enough exercise in the family is one of the determining factors, which causes a dramatically increasing number of children with overweight or even obesity.
"For example, only half of those surveyed said they ate breakfast-meal-meal-meal-dinner five times a day, which is one of the basic prerequisites for proper nutrition," the study found.
Without breakfast and evening snack
Experts point out that relative details are also essential for healthy development, including, for example, the regular time of family breakfasts.
In the Czech Republic, at the same time, only 23 percent of schoolchildren’s families eat breakfast.
In most families, everyone eats alone.
And the worst was the finding that in a tenth of households there is no breakfast at all.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The survey showed that families of obese children are much more likely to consume unhealthy fries.
Almost everyone – regardless of weight – drinks sweet lemonade (70 percent) every day.
Although more than 40 percent of the children surveyed regularly participate in sports, their parents had less than half the result - 15 percent.
Build your own dining room
The next part of the survey allowed selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to build their own dining room according to their own taste and opinion.
"The dietary preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 years are far from ideal in terms of healthy nutrition."
Among their favorite foods is a lot of floury, massive and sweet dishes.
"Apprehensive is especially the great popularity of sweet lemonades," said the final report to the survey.
For lunch, the main meal was the pasta, just above the poultry.
But the children practically did not want legumes at all and the popularity of fish and lunch vegetable dishes is low.
An Appeal to Health
At the same time, the survey showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits if they are given the right information.
"In the control group of survey participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the Obesity Awareness Lecture, it is no coincidence that in many cases there has been a significant shift in preferences towards the principles of healthy nutrition," the project's results state.
This was particularly striking for sweet lemonades, for example, where more children would begin to prefer plain water.
Children were also much more likely to check poultry and fish as the main meal of the day in the questionnaire, and would limit sweets and dumplings.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals say.
In the introductory article about how stylists learn, I was so worried that there was already a lot of it in the introductory classes.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
Lectures by three professionals from the field, dressing problematic characters and a seminar on how it goes to squares.
And it'll get worse.
The closer to the final exam, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And although the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, it is really "walked".
This time, we discussed with the director (there is not a single boy in the course) how to dress a woman who does not have a perfectly proportionate figure.
And that's the vast majority.
Someone has a short neck, someone has a boyish figure without proper curves, and someone is overweight again.
The stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders, lengthen the neck or add the necessary curves.
We were given tips, such as for a woman like Jennifer Lopez, i.e. larger breasts and hips and a narrow waist, to emphasize the figure nicely and at the same time not to dress the woman too provocatively.
For example, if the difference between the belt and the hips is such that the skirt or pants do not really fit, then it is worth having at least one such piece sewn to measure.
You will definitely not regret it, because perfectly fitting clothes are not to be paid for.
In a tailored skirt you will feel much better than in one that constantly moves, pulls out, stands out in the waist and so on.
The boy's character can, in turn, afford to wear clothes with lashes, applications, embroidery or picking up.
Of course, there are a lot of such information and types of characters, so I’m glad I have a whole week to sort out all the information in my head.
And yet I'm afraid, given the assigned homework, that's all it takes.
Each of the students has been assigned a celebrity, which is supposed to invent two outfits: day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the fashion style of the given personality and the type of character.
I'm going to "dress" Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I am happy in spirit, for me personally definitely better than Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, who recently gained maybe a hundred pounds (please take into account the excess), or young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes from magazines or search the Internet and print and then process them graphically.
Moodboard, as the whole result is called, will also express our personal style and relationship to graphic representation.
Thinking about the graphic page of styling is also important.
The stylist not only dresses physically, but also creates, for example, so-called product pages in magazines (for a specific assignment, for example, trends handbags, coats, etc.).
This was told to us by the stylist and designer Mario Kamen<0xC3><0xAD>k.
But not until Sunday.
The stylist must have a general overview
Saturday’s lecture, loaded with information about the types of characters, was expanded by three guests from the field.
Stylist Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Ren<0xC4><0x8D>.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should be able to take advantage of it.
And a skillful stylist can work with one piece of clothing differently.
In this case, variability is key.
For example, such a trench coat (or if you want to originally trenchcoat) can be worn classically over jeans and T-shirt as a cloak, but you can also wear it on a bare body, wear a boat and take pictures like a dress.
Or just pull out the sleeves or collar and immediately the whole look looks different.
'Play with it, 'he said.
But most of all, I appreciated the following advice: "To work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"Then you can start breaking them," Jacob said.
Finally, I can see why we are struggling with all those lessons, what to combine with, what to do, why, even when we see something different in fashion magazines.
Not to mention the shows.
Thanks to the photographer Ben, again, I know that the stylist must have prepared many more variations of clothes than how many can be photographed.
So for a fashion story that will have ten pages (i.e. ten outfits), I have to be ready to "set up" at least fifteen.
And also that in the photo clothes looks and works in combination with other pieces of lecqda completely different than in reality.
So we have to count on this when creating an outfit.
Honza Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> confirmed that the image and style makes up to half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a miracle singer, but the image and marketing made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, access to stylists’ services is rather cold.
Even familiar faces consider it to be unnecessary (it is enough that I know something, the way I look at it is secondary).
And if someone already lets us create styling, then we have to count on the fact that with a high probability he dictates to us a completely different (less) size than he really has.
Then all that remains is to google and see if the boulevard has not written about the fact that the celebrity has died/lost and so on.
Honza and Mario on Sunday put it to our hearts that it is not enough for stylists to orient themselves in fashion and to be able to put together outfits.
In his work, he communicates primarily with the people he dresses, and so it is important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to estimate people, not to encourage them, to stand by their opinion.
"If you're ordered by a manager to rearrange her wardrobe and fill it with nice pieces, you can't throw out the whole closet and say, for God's sake, that's terrible."
“Find at least a few things there that you’ll praise and recommend what to wear,” says Mario.
He also specifically showed us what everything must contain the so-called "plaque", or bag for the square.
It is the one that you turn on around the waist and you have all the necessary properties with you.
In addition to the bright things such as scissors, hair rollers or closing pins, there is also a silicone thread (with it the stylist helps to take pictures of products such as handbags or hats), special clips with which we put back clothes, if it is larger (pencils or other staples are not attached),
In order not only to listen, but also to try something practical, we learned how to properly subjugate shoes.
Even when shooting in a studio with a flat surface, the sole could get damaged, let alone outside.
And so we glued and glued.
We can't even touch our shoes with scissors so they don't get hurt.
So we really need skill.
Mario pleased me when he praised my creation without reservation.
This skill is not really my friend.
This is just a tiny fraction of what we heard about the second weekend of the course.
It is becoming increasingly clear to me that doing styling on a professional level is really not a walk in the pink garden, no matter who says what they want.
In Need for Speed: The Run, the race takes place all over America.
Testimonials
Originally a carefree ride turns into a routine morning commute to the sled because of a series of completely unnecessary errands.
Ambition has succeeded to a large extent, but it is not valid when no one has obviously wanted to do anything extra.
The new track, subtitled The Run, was highly anticipated before its release.
He promised that the flying Need for Speed racing series would once again take a bit of a new direction, and from the playable shows it seemed like a game that would not have to be just in numbers in the action racing genre.
We were also curious how the embedded passages will turn out, in which the main character will get out of the car and run after his own.
As with the NFS series, a lot of the results are a little different than we expected.
These are potentially decent arcade races, but the whole thing pulls down a few unnecessary bugs that have been appearing in the series for more or less a few years.
So it's not actually a mistake, but rather a manifestation of some kind of incomprehensible laziness of the developers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story whose main character Jack has certain problems of a personal nature and as a solution is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You will be driving on the west coast of San Francisco and your task is to be the first to arrive in New York.
The idea carries several interesting elements with it.
The route is divided into ten stages, and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race goes on a different track and the given stages are set in different, sufficiently different and interesting environments.
It doesn’t feel like the game is still offering the same thing.
In addition, some of the environments are very nice to look at, although the technical level of the graphics corresponds to the previous parts of the series.
So it's nothing worldly.
But driving through the desert, the autumn landscape or high in the snowy mountains seems visually very pleasant.
In addition, the races are from time to time strewn with some unusual element.
In the desert, for example, you get stuck in a sandstorm that significantly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to get caught by the avalanche.
In addition, individual races are quite well placed behind each other.
There are only a few types, but that’s enough.
For a while, you try to overtake the required number of opponents (essentially a classic race), then you catch up with time (a classic match with stops) and then a duel with a single opponent awaits you.
From time to time, the police will also be involved in this, which makes all your efforts even more unpleasant.
What's new is the passages outside the car.
Rather, it’s just an interactive animation where Jack usually runs away from someone and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right times.
Nothing complicated.
But it will surprise you that these passages are in the game much less than you would expect (specifically maybe even just three).
As a result, however, it is in the favor of the thing, because this element does not have a chance to become annoying and in the context of the above, it thus ranks among the elements that enhance the game.
The driving model follows in the footsteps of the previous parts.
This means that it is definitely no longer something, but it cannot be said that it would be a negation.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you will have to look elsewhere.
But the more action-oriented racing, the driving model here still fits quite well, although we could find a better one with the competition.
Until then, everything is in perfect order.
However, the problems begin to appear after some time.
Unlike the car, the car is no longer in good condition.
From a game of this type we do not expect to count complex deformations and collisions, but if practically before any impact to any object you have no idea how your car will behave, then perhaps everything is not quite right.
Typically, when passing cars in close proximity or passing cars in normal operation, sometimes you will only lick each other slightly, but at other times in almost identical situations your car will end up in wild pirouettes.
Or even a direct attack.
Thanks to the system of restarts it does not matter in any particular way, but it will degrade you reliably.
Restarts are handled in such a way that if you break up or go far off the track, the game throws you back to the last catch point on the track.
However, only five restarts are available in each race.
When you exhaust them, you have to start the race again from the beginning.
So it's more of a help in case something doesn't work out than you can rely on them.
But sometimes even restarts will not help, only the need to learn a certain stage of the race will solve them.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some curves need to pass in a specific way, otherwise you simply do not fit into them.
Other times, you will meet "civilian" cars in the same configuration at a given place, whether you arrive there first, fifth, five seconds earlier or a minute later.
This is especially true in situations where you see an opponent passing easily in front of you between two cars, while when you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you have to drive or brake them.
It does not matter when you reach them, because it is "counted" so that the situation always occurs right in front of your nose.
Opponents have another advantage.
Throughout the game you will come across several places where, again regardless of the time, you will always be overtaken by the same opponent in the same place.
The most striking thing at the end of the game is the long bridge, where you go in the opposite direction.
The opponent must obviously get in front of you at any cost.
When it goes in front of you, it makes the visibility of the cars in front of you worse, so at first you can get a good massage.
You can understand the intention to make the game more tense and adrenaline-fueled, but the execution is so obvious that it will reliably quickly disgust you.
And it’s a shame, because despite the simple driving model, playing is fun and places are so action-packed that sometimes you literally can’t keep track of where it’s flying.
And it doesn’t really matter if it’s a concept with fifty unique tracks, sorting races so boredom doesn’t stand a chance, or anything else.
An unusual idea is to change cars during races.
You have to pay attention to the gas pumps at the roads, because it is there that you can change the car, although in the vast majority of cases you are enough with what you just have.
The cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, strong American bullfighters on straight highways and exotic supersports for technical riding, for example after winding mountain roads.
With the main story mode goes hand in hand and challenge mode, which are races in individual locations that you know from the story.
Here you get not only medals, but also experience points to your profile, which is common for challenges and story.
To get a higher level of the driver, various items are unlocked: starting with the car and ending with the background for the profile.
At the same time, it is again connected to the online function Autolog, which, among other things, compares your achieved results with other players and provides other community functions.
One of the other hard-to-understand kicks is the situation from the last race in the story.
With your car you will get to the tunnel of the metro (below), where you can take it in the dark on the tracks (below).
On the tachometer you can see the numbers between 150 and 200 km/h (below) and in the rear a set of meters will be placed and you will be uncompromisingly shot down.
In the editorial office, we will probably have a discussion for a few more days about whether no one really thought a bit when creating the game, or whether the authors think we are really such a big fool.
The technical side of the game is nothing extra, but at least the overall visual impression is in most cases very pleasant and in some cases even great.
It freezes so that in some more tense moments, the shooting decreases, and in some cases it is quite tragic.
But this is especially true of storms with a larger number of participants, when smooth shooting would no longer be valid for you anyway.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In an attempt to appeal to the widest possible range of rather younger audiences, a soundtrack from the category "every dog different village" was created, but it can be assumed that due to listening to music, probably someone will not buy the game.
The overall feel of Need for Speed: The Run is so very sad.
If the game avoided completely unnecessary mistakes, then we would not be afraid to say that The Run is the best work of the NFS in recent years.
This is how the game looks unfinished.
The fun is sure to be fine, but be prepared for the fact that mistakes will shake your eyes with the power of airport spotlights.
Singing choirs of the UK will sing at the concert Students of the Summit

Ambassadors to the EU Vicen<0xC3><0xA1>:
Czechs have a reputation of negativity and Eurosceptics
"The Treaty of Lisbon has quite significantly upset the balance between the various institutions."
"I didn't expect it to be such a hard war."
"It will take five, six years for the situation to settle down, calm down and for all players to get used to their new roles," Czech Ambassador to the European Union Milena Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> began her lecture at the Faculty of Law.
As much as she takes her motto "Understandably and openly about Europe" seriously, she already showed in the first part of the lecture that she managed to describe the individual EU institutions and their relations in such a clear and understandable way that many lecturers from the UK Faculty of Law could envy her.
Vicen also praised the work of the new permanent President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, there was a criticism that he was inconspicuous, that he was a gray official, that he couldn't play any role, and I have to say that everyone was blown away, that he played that role well."
"He is a man who can listen to the twenty-seven Member States, communicate with them well, and has a clear vision of where the European Union should go."
The new post of High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy then explained as an answer to the question: "Who is this European Union? What phone number should I call?", that is, as a significant step towards unification and greater readability of EU policy towards states such as China or India.
Nobody wants to ban us from cheesecakes.
Vicen<0xC3><0xA1> has also devoted herself to the agenda that the European Council has lived, lives and will live in the near future.
The previous Czech Presidency has described it as a success.
The Czechs solved the emerging financial crisis, solved the gas crisis or organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was a major negative, which severely damaged the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU is currently very busy.
In the words of the Ambassador, the "fact frmol" was not only the presidency, but also the subsequent financial crisis that is still being solved today.
In addition, the new seven-year Union budget has yet to be approved, which is complicated by the current economic situation.
Whether the budget will be slim and economical, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will be supported more and which less, is all on the agenda for the next negotiations.
The Ambassador also recalled her main slogans with which she came to Brussels: "About Europe understandable".
"I really don't like ugly abbreviations, foreign words, handkerchiefs that no one understands.
How can a citizen understand that no curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes are really being invented in Brussels, or that someone really has to ban us from cheesecakes?
It also wants to make better use of the EU environment and get more Czechs into European institutions.
A multi-speed Europe awaits us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation of eurosceptics and people who notice the negative rather than the positive side of things.
In addition, it regrets the low representation of Czechs in the European institutions.
According to her, there are many factors to blame, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational letters, but also low support from the Czech side.
In addition to the successful Czech Presidency, it also highlighted the strength and cooperation of the Visegrad Four.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches, the Frenchman next to me will say, 'Look, what are you meeting there, what is your Visegrad Four?' and he doesn't look excited at all."
In the future, Vicenov said, the Union is mainly waiting for new tough rules for the budgetary policies of the member states.
The concept of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, rather than a new "European federation" is perceived as very real.
"We have countries in the eurozone and countries outside the eurozone."
"We have a Schengen area, we already have an institute of enhanced cooperation."
"For the first time, it was said that only countries that want to cooperate and those that don't want to cooperate should stand at a distance."
"There will be more of these institutes and it will be a strong two-speed Europe," Vicenov<0xC3><0xA1> expects.
In this respect, it also appreciated the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the principle that all issues affecting the Union should be discussed between all Member States, not just between euro area countries.
Brand story:
IBM Innovator Begins Second Century of Its Existence
If someone were to search for the word that would most accurately express IBM’s strategy, the closest one would probably be “long-term.”
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution, it is perceived as a very contemporary company, and yet it has been a hundred years since its foundation.
The basis of this longevity was laid by the first head of the company, visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already broken the password that many of the world’s problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became the imprint around which the life of the future giant will unfold (and also the name of an internal magazine, which began to be published at IBM as early as 1935).
It was also the basis of Watson’s carefully built corporate culture.
“For us at IBM, long-term thinking is a continuous movement toward the future.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained true to its core values and was not afraid to change everything else around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope to achieve even more in the second hundred," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current CEO.
A well-developed system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the care of his employees in a similar way to the businessman Bata in the Czech Republic - the people from IBM were among the first American employees to have paid leave, insurance from the employer plus an elegant employee uniform and a sophisticated system to reward the best inventors and businessmen.
IBM has a long-term relationship with the customer.
From the beginning, the company was brilliant at extracting talent - as one of the world's first companies, it abolished any discrimination, so it could choose.
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan is for Palmisana to be replaced by a woman, Virginia Rometty, at the head of IBM next year.
She has been working at IBM for 30 years and is still the head of sales, marketing and strategy.
In recent years, IBM has been making so-called pits, online brainstorming, from which many future strategies and innovations emerge.
No wonder there are so many ideas - almost half a million people work in the company.
An institution with a good name
A firm position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM had a concept of an institution rather than just a technology company," said Harvard Business School professor and author of the book about IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that helps solve business problems through the use of technology,” added George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering the market and creating the market directly.
IBM - or "Big Blue", as it is known in the United States because of its logo - has grown into one of the largest companies in the world in a hundred years.
It is arguably the most versatile technology company - developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services in a range of products from servers to nanotechnology.
It holds the most patents of any U.S. technology company, and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include an ATM, a payment card, a financial swap, a barcode or a floppy disk.
IBM, with about $220 billion, became the second-largest technology company by market capitalization this year (the first being Apple), when it surpassed Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
A look ahead
Not all products and innovations have caught the eye of customers and times - for example, IBM failed to bet on its own OS/2 operating system, online services Prodigy or IBM PCjr computers.
“If your business is built on moving forward, you can’t emotionally tie yourself to the past,” says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That’s why IBM has no problem building its foundations on many platforms – and if they don’t work, abandon them.
Unlike, for example, rival Microsoft, which basically stands and falls on the Windows operating system.
Prospective technology
IBM’s sales are largely driven by services, with software and hardware accounting for about a fifth of them.
As early as 1990, with more than half the share, he was the most powerful hardware representative.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-yield assets, and has invested $58 billion in the acquisition of promising technologies.
Investments have continued since 2008, the first time the world was overrun by the modern financial crisis.
IBM is acting on the advice of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who also increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, it seems that IBM is going through the current crisis untouched.
Since the beginning of 2008, IBM’s share price has risen by 120 percent, and the company’s net profit has been steadily increasing.
IBM’s motto is to change everything, but not its values.
Therefore, it can be expected that even if there is another crisis, this flexible giant will manage it.
History of IBM: From cheese slicer to space flight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York a hundred years ago, originally called the Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The IBM name wasn’t adopted until 1924 – it was originally a brand used for the company’s branches in Canada and South America.
The foundation for later IBM was laid by the merger of four companies, whose history dates back to the 1980s.
They owned technologies such as the famous "pissers," i.e. hours recording the employee's arrival and departure.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired the company's supervisory board.
Flint hired Thomas J. Watson, the head of a rival firm, to help him run the company.
The leader then overshadowed the founder of IBM - Watson's ideas are still built on an invincible corporate culture and identity.
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, started with the production and sale of all kinds of machines for business – from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years of Watson’s management, the company doubled its turnover to $9 million and began expanding to all parts of the world.
Watson was so indispensable to the company that he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior, after almost forty years in the executive chair.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence, developing the first programming language.
In the 1960s, people and computers from IBM helped NASA fly to space — to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969, the famous man-to-the-moon flight.
In 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "poodle" that set the computer standard of the time, called the IBM 5150, came to market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold Lenovo’s computer manufacturing business to China, bought the consulting arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, and began to devote itself fully to high-value-added consulting and services.
The strategy that IBM has been paying off over the last three years is the Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to make smart use of technologies in previously unplanned areas and to improve the situation, for example, in transport or city administration.
For the business sector, IBM recently introduced the platform “Smarter Commerce”, which helps traders to manage the entire commercial cycle.
IBM has a strong history in the country.
She founded her branch in Czechoslovakia in 1932 as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, in addition to IBM Czech Republic, there is also a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The Centre for Central and Eastern Europe is based in Prague and there is also a world-class research team dealing with voice recognition.
The Boyfriend of an Unfaithful Husband:
Iveta, keep that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> (53) said it was over!
After her husband Josef Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> (53) became not only the protector of Iveta Bartosov<0xC3><0xA1> (45), but also a lover, Darina still hoped that Joseph would wake up from a pink dream and return home.
But now she did not intend to wait any longer and set clear rules for the next life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner anymore," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> explained.
When Darina Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> gave Barto<0xC5><0xA1>ov<0xC3><0xA1> asylum in her home in the summer, she didn’t seem to know how her marriage would end.
Despite the fact that Iveta moved from <0xC5><0x98><0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>an after 30 days at her insistence, Pepa did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly admitted that he loved her.
Over time, Darina gave up, reconciled with her husband’s relationship, and now even said goodbye to him forever.
He doesn’t care who his wife sleeps with.
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> and Bartosov<0xC3><0xA1> had only parted once, his wife’s open arms would not be waiting for him at home.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to live his life in our common home, no one will drive him out."
"But he will experience it not as my beloved, stray old donkey, but as a person with whom I have certain ties," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> said, adding that she had already given up on her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
Joseph doesn't mind that Darina closed the back door for him yet.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta, and I'm not going to change it."
"My wife has a paper marriage, and I respect that."
"The company goes on, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"Darina and I are having a very normal time, except we don't share a bed together," Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99> said.
If Rycht<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ov<0xC3><0xA1> also found a new love, he would not be able to prevent it.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care where he goes, who he goes with and if he has a friend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility," concluded Josef.
The Worst Women’s Habits: Are They Affecting You Too?
When you ask men if they could name any typical female misbehavior, usually all of them in one are very promptly thrown out of the sleeve.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where there are several female vices that can perfectly dilute the blood in the veins of men?
Shopping
Does your other half blame you for being addicted to shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one piece of clothing per week?
Do you like to shop in bulk at discounts?
Then, in your case, you can talk about shopping as a bad habit.
Some women realize that they should at least curb their shopping passion a little.
But tell me, who would resist just walking around the clothes stores, looking for a well-fitting top and then try them all (ideally in different color versions) in the cabin?
Although it is a hobby for most women, it can literally become a hell for men.
Just remember how many times you've told your man to wait for you outside the door...
Constant Dissatisfaction
"Am I not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you like me at all?"
Don't these words remind you of anything?
Is that so?
Then you belong to those women who are obsessed with what they look like.
Not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but a lot of men are directly allergic to how their partners constantly complain about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the higher the frequency of this complaint, the more annoying women are.
Order and cleanliness in the first place
It's like a never-ending whirlwind.
Washing windows, vacuuming, wiping tiles, dusting, squeezing baths - at least twice a week.
Are you blaming your partner for stepping on a clean tile with dirty feet, the kids for soiling the scrubbed washbasin and smearing the glazed living wall you've worked so hard to polish?
In the event that you suffer from this "deviation", try to realize that nothing should be exaggerated and order and cleanliness should definitely not take place within the family in the first place.
This harmless desire for purity can jeopardize your mutual relationships and family well-being.
Screaming
"You used trainers, put them in the basket."
"Are you going to wear those old socks tomorrow, too?"
"A wet towel doesn't belong on the ground."
If you yell at your partner like this several times a day, know that you can reliably turn it around.
Of course, you don’t mean it badly, you want to make sure everything is in order.
Maybe if men knew it, women wouldn't have to yell at them so much...
Screaming, squealing
For some women, gossip, gossip, as well as insults and colluding against someone are their own.
Women are focused on relationships, and so they like to discuss things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
I hope each of us throws some little harmless gossip or slander out there.
Hands on your heart, it's probably all women's.
On the contrary, they are the crumbs of the coarsest grain, which they like and often grumble, perhaps despise everyone and are especially dangerous for their surroundings - especially within the women's work collective.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr and Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek helped to win Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr took part in Monday's NHL game with two assists to win Philadelphia 5:3 on Caroline's ice and is once again at the forefront of the productivity of Czech players in the competition.
From the overview of the thirty-nine-year-old star, in both cases, Claude Giroux, who added one more pass and was declared the best player of the match.
Jakub Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek also recorded two assists in the match.
After the match, J<0xC3><0xA1>gr told reporters that he had predicted a great evening for Giroux.
"Before the game, I told him he'd get a hattrick."
"I felt it."
"Sometimes you feel that way," J<0xC3><0xA1>gr explained, after which Giroux scored the first shot of the Flyers.
A moment later, the second team intervention had a Czech track.
Vor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek fought off a disc behind the Hurricanes goal and presented it between the circles to score to Maxim Talbot.
The second before the first break was reduced in weakness by home player Patrick Dwyer, but the introduction of the second part again belonged to the Flyers.
Specifically, the Giroux.
After teaming up with J<0xC3><0xA1>gr, he scored a third goal, then crossed his shot in the fourth goal by Wayne Simmonds.
"I love playing with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely one of the top three," Jagr said.
“I never thought I’d play hockey like him at the end of my career.”
"I'm happy about that."
"I want to play him."
"All those years in the NHL, my teammates tried to play me, now it's turning around," added J<0xC3><0xA1>gr.
Carolina also made the match a drama, with the goal of Tuoma Ruutua and again Dwyer, who was promoted from the penalty shootout, got to the difference of one goal.
Matt Read, who finished the renumbering of two to one, did not allow further complications.
"He hit our Pronger range very well."
"He pushed the disc out, I picked up the speed, and (Read) went to a more distant pole."
"I tried to hit him and I'm glad it worked out," Voracek described the last leg of the match from his perspective.
Philadelphia took the lead in the Eastern Conference with the victory.
The Czech defender of Montreal Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>pa<0xC4><0x8D>ek did not win the match against Buffalo, in the second third he resigned due to injuries in the upper part of the body.
In addition to the experienced beck, Candiens also lost the two-goal lead and lost after a 2:3 penalty shootout.
One of their raids did not change Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Plekanec.
The home coach was hated by a large marauder in the back row rather than the lost points, with the game being played by only five defenders.
"It's bad."
"We only played with one experienced player, the rest were young players."
"But there's just nothing we can do about it, we have to deal with it," said Jacques Martin.
"Alternating after altering it fell on us and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, move the puck out of our band."
We had gaps in that," added one of P. K. Subban's defenders.
Czech goalkeeper Ond<0xC5><0x99>ej Pavelec contributed 30 shots to Winnipeg’s 5:2 win over Tampou Bay.
The goals of the Jets, who broke the five-game losing streak, were shared by five different shooters.
How Tour Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989, only five state travel agencies were allowed in Czechoslovakia: <0xC4><0x8C>edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time were overwhelmingly selling only trips to the countries of the socialist bloc, as travel to the west was very limited.
Czech tourists thus traveled on holiday to the NDR (German Democratic Republic), to the Soviet Union (Society of Crimea on the Black Sea), to Bulgaria, Romania (both to the Black Sea) and to Hungary (Balaton).
A bright exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when it was possible to travel to Yugoslavia, but then the Yugoslav regime leaned towards the West and the trips of Czech tourists to Yugoslavia were subsequently very limited.
The great paradox of the socialist era was that the citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel individually freely even within the socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or to the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter from this country, otherwise an individual trip was not possible.
Travel agencies at the time also offered trips to the West, but it was necessary to stand up to the front overnight with a sleeping bag or have a "well-known" in the travel office.
But it was not won either.
The so-called foreign exchange promise, which was a condition for travel to the West, was not given to "politically unreliable people" who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency, so without a foreign exchange commitment it was not possible to obtain funds (Western currency) on the way to the West.
By far the most frequent, however, the Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, which resulted in a large number of chats and cottages that the Czechs acquired and this habit survives to this day.
The Czech Republic has experienced a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 it was our highest holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million vacations abroad in countries all over the world.
A huge paradox that we are no longer aware of today is that it was not possible for us to travel freely to the most popular Croatia until 1989, as it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
Right from the turn of the 1990s, the visa requirement in neighbouring Western European countries was lifted, which triggered a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Austria’s Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks could not get enough trips to the West for a long time, everyone wanted to look there for at least a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czechs slept in parks in tents, because our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs’ travel during this time was to drive their own food, cans, salamis, etc., to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the freely exchangeable Czech crown, so that our tourists could finally freely buy the Western currency after many destinations for years.
However, our standard of living and, with it, average wages were rising, which resulted in another important moment around 1997.
Due to the increased demand for travel, travel agencies have started to regularly prepare trips by charter airlines since 1997, which has resulted in an incredible discount on air travel due to the possibility to book bulk discounts compared to the past.
By the end of the 1990s, the Czechs had already had visa-free access to virtually all the developed countries of the world, except the US, which further facilitated our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary travel came in 2000 when, thanks to considerable demand, it was sent from the Czech Republic historically the first direct charter flight to the exotic, it was to Thailand.
Since this year, direct charters have been flying with Czech tourists every year to warm distant countries, this winter will fly directly from the Czech Republic to twelve exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visited by around 100,000 Czechs a year!
Another interesting moment in this period, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the U.S. visa for Czech tourists was revoked, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs also spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) for the first time in history and spent more than 15 thousand CZK per person for one foreign holiday, including the cost of living.
The General Assembly is to find the President, but again he is in danger of falling
Czech football has been without a chairman for almost five months and there is a threat that the successor of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek at the head of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R) will not be known even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
There is still no agreement as to what electoral procedure will be followed.
Without it, there will be no vote on which of the three candidates will be elected.
Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k are interested in leading Czech football.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek resigned in June and on his departure called on his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality that would lead football in the future.
However, in the post-Hask era, football has slipped back to the trenches between the two Bundeschambers, which cannot agree on a common candidate.
It was revealed on September 16, when the new president was to be elected.
The delegates of the general assembly went to the National House in Prague in Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov unnecessarily, because the negotiations remained blocked and it was not just a way of choosing.
There was not even a consensus on who had the right to vote in the assembly - whether only the statutory representatives or even the functionaries of the full power of attorney.
In this single point, a partial agreement has been reached since then, which was helped by the recommendations of the State Institute and the law according to which representation on the basis of full power is not possible.
However, there are still disputes over the electoral system.
The Executive Committee has not made it all too clear that it is not dealing with anything else at all at its meetings, whether regular or extraordinary.
The view of choice has changed several times, but the neuralgic point is still the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the 3rd round to exclude the possibility of a heel?
"The dispute is whether to proceed in accordance with the statutes or to find another model," said one of the three vice-presidents of FA<0xC4><0x8C>R Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Svoboda, who represents professional football in the leadership of the association.
According to the statutes of the proposed model in the third round, the candidate will win, which will have a higher percentage of support in the chamber for which he is running.
Morava is reportedly willing to step down to win a candidate who gets a higher percentage of votes from both chambers.
And the Czech party insists on the condition that the winner must gain at least a two-thirds advantage in this percentage increase.
"But if that would make no sense of the two previous rounds, it would completely negate the two-chamber concept," understood the opposition of the Moravian party Svoboda, according to which the best order would be to not bend and vote according to the valid statutes.
Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k agrees with this somewhat surprisingly, although it is estimated that the electoral order determined by the statutes is most suitable for Pelt of all candidates.
"I wish it could be elected according to the statute."
"Not to invent some representative nonsense like at the last general meeting," said owner Viktorie Plze<0xC5><0x88>, who is running for the first time and in his statements has defined himself above all against Pelt.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him, in Nymburk, the new president will know and believe that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All the passions will calm the possible progress of today's national team for the European Championships."
"Football will be on the happy wave again, there will be a greater willingness to cooperate," says the Jablonec official, who has the most experience with football management at both professional and regional levels.
Rajchl is more restrained.
"I hope so, but unfortunately the situation is very divisive."
"It's not between the people of Bohemia and Moravia, but there are attempts to adapt the regulations on purpose."
"This may cause the blockage of the general meeting to occur again."
"But I hope common sense wins," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to reach an agreement.
Some negotiations were supposed to take place directly in Montenegro, but who knows if the football generality will be complete in the match.
The air special, in which the Vice-Presidents Dalibor Ku<0xC4><0x8D>era and Rajchl were to travel to Podgorica, among others, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical failure and was looking for a replacement option to transport part of the Executive Committee to the site of the barrage withdrawal.
In the end, it may be a crucial meeting at the ministerial level, which could reportedly take place on Wednesday.
The Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Josef Dobe<0xC5><0xA1>, would like to bring the parties split within the strongest sports association in the country to an agreement.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming general meeting of <0xC4><0x8C>STV, which will address the new direction of Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka.
The Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k is going to fight for the president because he does not see a suitable candidate
If the head of football players in Pilsen Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k had seen a strong candidate in front of the extraordinary general assembly who would fulfill all his ideas about the new president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FA<0xC4><0x8C>R), he would not have even applied for the top position.
"If a quality adept exists, I'm fighting for him and I'm not going to the election."
"But in the current situation, no one has been able to find such a person," said <0xC4><0x8C>TK Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k.
In the fight with Miroslav Pelt and Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k is motivated to try to prevent Pelt, the alleged favorite of the elections, from being in the lead of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also points out that if he won, he would only last until 2013, when there is a proper general meeting on the program.
In the function, he would like to see an experienced and top-notch manager, who is not too connected with the football event.
"I've been talking to some people who would come to mind."
"It was crazy for me when some people said they didn't even want to identify with Czech football at the moment."
"I would like to change that view," he said.
According to Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, Pelt’s connection with the chairman of the Pilsen Regional Football Association Roman Berbre, a man with a controversial reputation who is known in the background as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates at the general meeting, is now most disturbing.
It is so unacceptable for Pall<0xC3><0xAD>k that Pelta is in the position of president.
"If he won, the current situation would be preserved and nothing would move forward in football."
"Combined with the support of Berbra, who is a skilled trader, it would not benefit football any more," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
He also points out that Pelt’s name years ago was used in interrogations in the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelt emerged without punishment.
"I don't know what prestige Pelt's victory would bring to football."
"And what we would also look like in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA," Paclik said, but he also takes a look at his former statement that he would "sell the Plze<0xC5><0x88> club if Pelta became president".
However, if Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k triumphed in the Thursday election, he could imagine future cooperation with Pelt.
He is also considering another candidate Rajchl, whom Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k supported before the September general meeting, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I'd go after."
"He has great abilities."
"I could imagine him as the head of the team."
"But he couldn't manage the association as a manager."
"I also don't stick my nose where I can't," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who in September drew a lot of attention by standing behind the appeal of the arbitration panel headed by Lu<0xC4><0x8D>ek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Paci<0xC4><0x8D><0xC3><0xAD>k says he would dare to lead the association.
He appeals to his ability to manage private companies, since last summer he also heads Pilsen, which with his support celebrated the premier league triumph in May.
"I have the power to make a difference in the football environment to contribute to its cultivation."
"To limit the influence of some interest groups, which may have a tendency to influence the disciplinary and appeal commission, which treats up to unpleasant situations," said Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who does not share his antipathies, for example, to the Spartan boss Daniel K<0xC5><0x99>et<0xC3><0xAD>nsk<0xC3><0xBD>.
One of his priorities would also be to strengthen FA<0xC4><0x8C>R’s relations with the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he would lobby political leaders to get more money from lottery taxes into the sport.
"It's one of the key things the new president should be doing."
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties declare, I understand their arguments, but they have to say on a level where the money goes," he said.
As a burden now Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k does not even take its connection with the Pilsen club, although he himself claims that the chairman of the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R should be "supra-party".
Pelta is again connected with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prague's Duklo.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see any point in hypocritically transferring my shares to someone in a club in Pilsen and returning there in a year and a half," Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k said.
Pelta promised new FA<0xC4><0x8C>R statutes that would exclude the electoral pat
Two days before the general assembly of the football association, one of the candidates for the chairmanship of Miroslav Pelta promised that if elected, he would bet that the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would have new statutes that would definitively exclude disputes over the electoral order in the future.
The Jablonec official is optimistic ahead of Thursday’s meeting in Nymburk and believes that the pre-election fight will significantly dampen the possible success of today’s football team.
Pelta had already promised before the September election that he would concentrate on representing and raising funds if he was elected.
He decided to go to the election before the last general assembly at the last moment, so a two-month delay could be useful for him to defend his ideas about the management of football and present them in a broader context.
"People at all levels have been playing football for a long time and expect the president to be known on Thursday."
"It feels like it's high time for someone to lead the association," says the man, who is primarily associated with the Jablonec club, but who has worked for many years in Sparta and the union's executive committee.
He also believes that he has enough experience to drive Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is the euphoria that prevailed during the reign of Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"Unfortunately, at the June general meeting, the statutes were approved, which were not as perfect as everyone thought."
"If they don't allow different interpretations, we've had a chairman since September," Pelta said.
It was precisely the reworking of the most important document of the civil association that he saw as a bulwark to the delegates.
"If I become president, I will take it as a personal task and I am willing to take personal responsibility if it fails."
"It's a principled thing we can't be without," Pelta says.
He says he doesn’t want to fight against his rivals.
He has previously advised that he can imagine working with Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl, whom he acknowledges for his legal education, and knows full well that his counter-candidate would be his first vice-president.
For a long time he did not attack Tomas Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k, who, on the contrary, did not leave a thread dry on Pelt.
"He's been in football for over a year, he's had some success."
"But his attacks were unworthy and a lot of people were surprised by the election campaign in a way."
"That is why a number of them are now questioning his true character," he said at the opponent's address, which he said remains faithful to the proclamations he announced in September.
According to him, his most powerful weapon is knowledge of football from the lowest competitions to the national team.
It should be a football display case.
"And I would also try to end all affairs, starting with the Bohemians case or the echoes of last year's corruption scandal."
"I would then rush to negotiations with the private and state sectors to secure enough money for the whole football," the 46-year-old candidate said two months ago.
At the time, he also promised that his coming to the top of football would not mean any personnel purges.
"I would have to get acquainted with the filling of individual employees first," he pointed to Strahov, where there is understandable nervousness from a long period of statelessness.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios that accompany the upcoming general assembly, he believes that delegates will not go to Nymburk unnecessarily on Thursday.
"If the only issue is how he's going to be elected in the third round, then we can move on."
"Football needs credibility, and that's where it only gets it by finally having its leader back," Pelta remains optimistic two days before perhaps the decisive day of his career.
Rajchl promises that under him FA<0xC4><0x8C>R would start working hard
If the current Vice-President Jind<0xC5><0x99>ich Rajchl was elected as the new President of the Football Association of the Czech Republic at the Thursday general meeting, many people in the association would not be happy about it.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will start working hard.
It wants to enforce systemic changes and make the members of the executive committee responsible for individual football areas.
He also promised to solve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, bring more money to football and continue the work begun by former president Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
"As president, I would like to focus on football as a whole."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA through national team, professional football, performance football after youth."
"But I'm not saying that I'd do everything myself," Rajchl said in an interview with the CTC.
“I’m a team player and I want to divide the competencies in the executive committee so that each member is involved in certain areas.”
"And I'm going to give it a hard task to get football a mile ahead in every segment."
"A lot of people probably wouldn't be happy because they would start working really hard and not just criticizing the work of others," he added.
Due to the critical atmosphere in the football movement, he said that he would not run again.
"I know I work 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know that it will make sense and that I will not have people behind me who will constantly throw their hands under my feet and question my every move," he said.
"A lot of people told me not to give up, because then others would give up."
"That's a confidence I can't just throw away," he said.
He is also said to be motivated by the continuation of the work he started with Haske.
"A lot of work has been done in those two years, and I don't want to throw it away now."
"There are processes that are going to be resounding in just a few years, and I would not like anyone to stop them," he said, fearing that if another candidate Miroslav Pelta was elected, the situation on the union could return to the time before the Hague.
"I believe in systematics, and that's something that Mirek Pelta doesn't know."
"There are people behind him, above all, who would make football so that it would be only for the chosen ones."
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but it's certainly not that I'm biased."
“I try to be objective.”
"I want to play football for everyone, because then everyone will be fine and not just the election," Rajchl said.
He also denies the claim that he was only a Czech president.
"Even if some people try to argue otherwise, I plan to do the most for Moravia."
"For example, it is time to think about the fact that the second league would be divided into the Czech and Moravian part, the winners of which would go to the first league."
"It would not be the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia," Rajchl said.
Since the head of the Pilsen club Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pacl<0xC3><0xAD>k also took part in the fight for the president, Rajchl does not dare to estimate his chances for election.
"But I still feel a strong support in the Czech chamber, which elected me as its vice-president and sees that there are clear successes behind me," said Rajchl, who considers his successes to be the saving of tens of millions of crowns on unfavorable contracts, the negotiation of television contracts and negotiations.
On the contrary, he takes for a companion the fact that the tie does not pull for one rope.
While he claims Pelt is "disqualified to give back to Czech football confidence", Pal<0xC3><0xAD>k considers the other opponent as a strong candidate who has football to offer.
"No one can doubt that he did a great job in Pilsen that year."
"If he were elected, he would probably continue in the things that Ivan Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek started here and would not fundamentally change the staffing in the committees."
"He wouldn't want to twist it to his advantage," Rajchl said.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
Jump into the blue
Julia Stanek
A whirlpool from the perspective of Ufon, a luxurious pool in Budapest: Those who travel through Europe can experience its blue miracle - and after exploring the cities or traveling let their tired feet rest in thermal spas.
The book will show you where the wellness is most beautiful by the water.
When Iris Meder went on a voyage of discovery in the past one and a half years, her luggage should not be missing: her swimsuits.
Lying a hint on the water, she looked up into the artistically shaped domes, swam across the marble putti (buildings of a little naked boy, a child (with wings)) waiting for her at the edge of the pool and admired the carefully restored Art Nouveau floats.
If she liked a swimming pool, she took it to her notebook in an instant - even with remarkable details about the way the building was built and the history of the building.
More than 200 swimming pools have been explored in this way by the architectural historian Meder and she now presents them in her recently published book "Badefreuden (The Joy of Bathing)": People's swimming pools in Munich, the historic palace of swimming pools in the Black Forest, the "hard core of concrete buildings" in Taunus.
In 13 countries, she has been guided by her "Road to the most extraordinary spas in Central Europe": In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited locations in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland - and always one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
With sport, it doesn’t go too far, says Meder – it’s just something else in the water.
The only thing to anger is that the fans of swimming have to settle for blue pebbles and the smell of chlorine, while health runners can inhale the intoxicating smell of spruce forests or listen to the cheerful glow of birds in the park.
"One day I asked myself why the swimming pool must always be so ghastly," says Mrs. Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting nice floats."
The water level doubles the architecture
Splashing in the jumping pool and essential oils for the sauna - the factor of well-being is therefore so great that it affects all senses, so much Mrs. Meder.
And when the founders tried, swimming pools can be a real treat for the eyes: "Instead of the floor, a person has a water level in the spas."
"It's transparent, on the other hand, but it reflects the beauty of the whole building."
Everything optically doubles: a high vault, a colorful tile, a jumping board.
The small-format picture volume "Badefreuden (Joy of bathing)" provides on 190 pages everything you need to know about the architectural and cultural history of the historical oases of the wellness - but above all it excites the desire to jump into the blue.
A remarkable specimen was discovered by the plumber Mrs. Meder during her search in Hungary.
In addition to the wonderful medicinal baths, such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi bath in Budapest, she found water with nitrogen content in the original karst cave (the cave bath in Miskolc-Tapolca) and thermal baths, the pools of which are filled with alkaline water and are um<0xC3><0xAD>s.
In contrast, many heated swimming pools under the open sky in Switzerland and Austria offer a wonderful view. While one has from the Curonian Spit swimming pool on the eyes of the whole city, in the outdoor swimming pool of the spa in St. Anton there is a snow-covered Arlberg and the meadow is covered with snow.
Perhaps the most remarkable pool design awaits spa guests in L<0xC3><0xA4>ngenfeld: the <0xC3><0x96>tztal Aquapark looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
In winter, steam rises from the three open basins behind the <0xC3><0x96>tztal mountain towards the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Not in every swimming pool collector Mrs. Meder smelled of chlorine in the pipes.
Many thermal baths are smelled of sulfur, in the spas of <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d in Békescsab, Hungary, it smells of heating oil to the point that one can hardly believe that he got into a therapeutic bath.
The smell comes from healing water with an alkaline hydrogen carbonate content that is almost black and whose sediments cling to the skin as soon as a person slips into the pool - a somewhat special wellness experience.
However, one place Iris Meder was also disappointed in her search for nice spas: When she wanted to visit the Czech solar and climate spa Luha<0xC4><0x8D>ovice, she came across a closed terrain.
In 1902, the spa designed by architect Du<0xC5><0xA1>an Jurkovi<0xC4><0x8D> was closed.
When Mrs. Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red-and-white-yellow Art Nouveau building, she saw the vast expanse of weed growing between the tiles.
They faced extinction in a magical swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wildbad.
These spas already have three phases of construction; one can discover not only the Neo-Romanesque elements that come from the time of their creation in 1844, but also the Moorish hall in the style of the Alhambra, which was added around 1900.
Since its careful modernization in 1995, the Palais Thermal has been Mrs. Iris Meder’s favourite spa destination, not only because she comes from the Black Forest.
"It's already a performance, to combine such diverse building styles into such a beautiful complex," says Mrs. Meder.
For such a palace, immersion in the thermal pool is probably a peripheral matter.
Agrarian Speculation
Deutsche Bank has ordered a review of the commodity trade.
Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank leave its trade in agricultural raw materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann commissioned a working group to investigate the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
Then, in January, the head of the group wants to deduce the consequences.
Hamburg –
According to one study, 84% of Germans consider it unacceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents even ask Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions to step out of the deal as it deepens the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a Forsa survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by Foodwatch in mid-October.
In it, author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity exchanges drives prices up, and banks therefore bear the brunt of the world’s hunger problem.
The consumer protection campaign is aimed specifically at Deutsche Bank chief Josef Ackermann, although big banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are also acting in a similar manner.
Commodity bets were originally designed to insure traders against price fluctuations.
In the meantime, however, most experts agree that capital market participants with an interest in high-risk trades have disengaged from supply and demand – and made profits at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to the criticism: He promised to check the excuses and said that no trade "is not worth giving Deutsche Bank a good reputation at stake".
According to the information SPIEGEL ONLINE is controlled by an international working group from Foodwatch-Report.
By the end of the year, the audit is to be closed, then the results will be presented to Deutsche Bank's Board of Directors - along with a recommendation on how to handle it.
Then, at the end of January, the bank’s representatives want to announce the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the commodity trade or even a complete rejection.
Ackermann works on his own image.
The head of Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the report, but at the same time reinforced his criticism of the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices shows particularly drastically how, regardless of the bank, it is harming the general welfare today."
Let Ackermann, as the highest banking lobbyist, do his duty.
“Deutsche Bank has to cut off from its portfolio all items that use money to bet on food prices,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter whether Mr. Ackermann is about starving people or Deutsche Bank's reputation."
Ackermann’s insight seems surprising at first glance, but it’s clear that the CEO would like to leave the perfect picture a few months before he leaves office.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the head of the board of directors would not attend the Supervisory Board in any other way than planned.
By turning away from controversial agrarian speculation, he could improve his image.
And he does not have to worry about possible losses - he should eventually deal with his successor.
Everyone else would have put out an investment in raw materials.
Foodwatch is trying to maintain high pressure on the manager.
So far, more than 30,000 Internet users have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published a survey in which the Forsa Institute interviewed 1001 people on November 7 and 8.
Eleven per cent said it was legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments that are linked to food price bets.
Many bank customers would also have personal consequences if they found out that their bank is involved in such transactions: Each other would, as a result of the survey, cancel all investments in which money flows into speculation with raw materials.
43% of those familiar with such a bank would warn, 49% said they would consider canceling their account and move to another institution.
21st century house in Vienna
The Moved Pavilion
Ingeborg Wiensowski
The story of architecture with peaks, falls and happy endings: The Austrian pavilion from the 1958 World’s Fair in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, remained empty and deserted.
It is now reopened as an exhibition hall.
When it comes to modern post-war architecture, clear forms, glass halls, bold booms and new building materials that are typical of the belief in technical progress, then the Austrian pavilion of the architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels World’s Fair 1958 is a resounding and celebratory one.
Schwanzer's pavilion was awarded the Grand Prix d'Architecture for its lightweight and high-performance steel and glass construction.
The building is still considered to be a milestone of contemporary architecture.
He famously built the Austrian pavilion for the next world exhibitions.
With its legendary four-cylinder BMW palace plus as the key made by the side building in Munich, it finally became internationally famous in 1973.
As a temporary exhibition building, the pavilion designed after the world exhibition was placed in the Schweizer Garten near the Vienna S<0xC3><0xBC>dbahnhof (South Station), renovated and opened in 1962 the Museum of the 20th century - it was named as "House of the 20th century".
But the building was not suitable for the museum, neither spatially nor technically - there were no walls for hanging art exhibits, no suitable climate.
Nevertheless, it was used until contemporary art took place at the new stand in Vienna.
Since 2001 the building has been empty and has been growing more and more.
Now the architect Adolf Krischanitz has reconstructed the pavilion, now bearing the name "House of the 21st century" and will be used in the future as a Museum of Contemporary Art.
On Tuesday evening there will open the Museum Belvedere, to which the palace belongs, the first exhibition - a happy intention in every respect.
The new beginning of Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, was set in motion.
Husslein-Arco, a promoted art historian with a significant career, i.e. in the youth of a painter, later in Sotheby's, Guggenheim Museum and as the founding director of the Museum of Modern Salzburg, strongly promoted the reconstruction of politicians and conservators.
In addition to contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba should be exhibited by the same foundation, a café and bookstore should be established, and an office building must be built for this purpose.
Strict supervision, low budget.
Krischanitz was then the ideal cast for the performance.
Not only did he sensitively reconstruct and expand the Art Nouveau buildings of Joseph Olbrich in Vienna and win the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Vienna at Schwanzer, and the pavilion was for him "an extremely important place" where "almost every weekend" he viewed exhibitions.
He knew the original project and also knew the problems of the building, which had already lost its generosity and ease of use during its relocation to Vienna and the change of use.
During the current reconstruction, there were much bigger problems: the building was “a catapult for energy,” says Krischanitz.
The profiles of the glass facade windows were replaced, glass fiber reinforced insulating glass was used, and the glass roof was replaced with a special safety glass.
Cold bridge-steel girders have been reinforced or replaced, and asbestos-filled ceilings have been rehabilitated.
Two underground floors provided space for new use, a recessed lighting channel between the building and the street provides lighting, a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building, but still a generous Schwanzer pavilion.
The original entrance door has been preserved, the building is painted in an old anti-corrosion red-brown color tone.
And the cinema is even exactly the same as it was before.
And all this under the strict supervision of the memorial office and a low budget.
“Often a material that is good and cheap and also liked the memorial office had to be found,” says Krischanitz, pointing to the broken floor of the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reconstruction, the building remained flexible and airy.
It is said that it was difficult with the pavilion, "which came here from Brussels", said Krischanitz recently, a typical "Drop-in-the-City-history".
Such an architecture is said to be "always in the wrong place" and yet wants to "be properly self-confident".
In this case, however, the 21st century House is not in an inappropriate place, as an urbanistic happy coincidence has taken place: in the district around Schweizer Garten, a completely newly designed "City Quarter at the Main Station" with office and residential buildings is created.
And perhaps there will be another lucky coincidence: the house of the 21st century could receive support from another Krischanitz building, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg bought the Berliner Tempor<0xC3><0xA4>re Kunsthalle and, as you can hear, is already dealing with the city about the neighborhood on the site of the Schweizer Garten.
The railway is planning a package for the winter crisis in the amount of one million
The track has drawn up a crisis plan to prevent train outages in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
It'll cost millions.
In the fight against winter train failures and delays, Deutsche Bahn is spending more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70 million this year, according to a report in the newspaper.
The newspaper "Bild" brought a preliminary report with reference to the internal group plan, which is said to count until 2015 with a total investment of about 300 million euros.
Its aim is to improve the use of trains and rail networks even in extreme weather conditions.
It is planned, among other things, to double the number of internal and external employees to 16,000 people to remove snow on railway facilities and platforms.
The goal is to get rid of the platform before the start of operation and 90 percent for the operation of the necessary bends during four to five hours of snow and ice.
Two months ago, the head of the R<0xC3><0xBC>diger Grube railway, after meeting at the highest level with representatives of the government and industry, warned of train failures and delays also during this winter.
In the past winter season, the track in passenger transport had significant problems, because, among other things, in difficult weather conditions, it had a lack of reserves.
Numerous new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval by the Federal Railway Authority.
In addition, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE trains.
The track has also not been able to cope for years with the fact that ICE train axles are likely to have to be inspected more frequently in workshops when one ICE train at Cologne Central Station destroyed the axle.
Deutsche Bank to pay $1 million fine in U.S.
After the riot around the head of Josef Ackermann there are new trampolines in the USA: Deutsche Bank there has to pay millions in damages.
As if Deutsche Bank didn’t have enough problems at home, its past in the U.S. has caught up: the Frankfurt institution is paying $145 million (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>106 million) in a one-off settlement to settle disputes over the bankruptcy of five major cooperative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgages.
The NCUA Financial Market Regulator blames a whole host of major banks for tricking cooperative banks into making false promises to buy financial products; that risks may have been reduced.
Such papers lost much in value during the crisis and dragged banks into the abyss with them.
"We are satisfied that we were able to resolve the issue without having to drag the parties to court," a spokesman for Deutsche Bank said in New York.
The bank does not admit any guilt by settling.
The same goes for Citigroup, which has pledged to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the support of both monetary institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for cooperative banks in the U.S. and assists in bankruptcies to protect customer receivables.
NCUA is seeking compensation for billions of dollars in damages.
The now-completed settlements are the first of their kind.
The regulator has also joined other big banks and sued JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs in the summer.
In the case of doubtful mortgages, these are so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on bank loans.
When the U.S. bubble burst around real estate in 2007, it became a fate for many financial firms.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US-Investmentbank Lehman Brothers changed its mind.
Even though the events happened a few years ago, now the banks are blowing in the face of strong winds.
Investors and supervisory authorities have filed numerous lawsuits to seek redress or to be misled.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has launched the largest wave of lawsuits.
He told 18 major international banks that two U.S. state-owned financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, had taken advantage of about $200 billion in mortgage deals.
Also, Deutsche Bank has to face the FHFA lawsuit, which involves multiple transactions totaling about $14.2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurt Institute be held liable for "substantial losses" without, however, specifying an exact amount.
Deutsche Bank rejected the request as unsubstantiated and said it wanted to defend itself.
Warren Buffett joins IBM with $10 billion
Financial guru Buffett is investing heavily in IBM’s IT business.
Since March, he has bought shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Warren Buffett has always stated that he will not invest in IT and computers, because the long-term development of companies can only be predicted with difficulty.
Now, however, he has read IBM’s business reports and changed his mind about investing in the industry.
Long ago, he had to understand that IBM primarily offers services and acquires computer systems for IT departments of other companies.
Warren Buffett’s investment in the financial world is considered a knighthood fit.
As a result, it may now be called the IBM IT backbone "Sir IBM".
Buffett told CNBC that he had bought $10.7 billion worth of IBM stock since March.
Berkshire Hathaway became one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a 5.5% stake.
Buffett said that even IBM did not know anything about his involvement.
He praised the management, who even tried to get a decent return during the economic crisis.
"You did a great job," Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has been betting for a long time on lucrative IT services such as the operation of computing centers.
The more than 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consulting as well as powerful computers for businesses.
Buffett has avoided tech companies to this day.
He says he only invests in companies whose activities he also understands.
Instead, Buffett reached the freight railroad, the lubricant manufacturer, or the machine products.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns, in addition to about 80 of its own subsidiaries, also shares in a number of large corporations such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly M<0xC3><0xBC>nchener R<0xC3><0xBC>ck.
The 81-year-old took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and built one of the most valuable businesses in the world with wise investments.
Yet his way of life is modest.
It is therefore a cult figure for many investors around the world.
His almost infallible sense of money-making earned him the nickname "Oracle of Omaha (The Miracle of Omaha).
When Buffett’s investment became known, IBM stocks rose by one percent before the stock market began.
“Big Blue,” as IBM is also called, has a total market value of more than $220 billion and is ranked among the world’s most valuable technology companies along with Apple and Microsoft.
At Microsoft, so many Buffetts, he wouldn't want to perform.
Bill Gates is said to be his best friend.
The threat is tangible.
After the discovery of the “Zwickau Bullets”, the Turkish media have doubts about the German rule of law.
The newspaper even talks about a “bloody ideology” that is now reviving.
The murders of eight small businessmen of Turkish origin and one Greek between 2000 and 2006 had a right-wing extremist background.
In Turkey and within the German-Turkish population in Germany, fear and concern have responded to this report.
For many German Turks, this brings back a horror that has long been considered dead: since the incendiary attacks in M<0xC3><0xB6>lln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there has been no comparable violence with a right-wing extremist background.
That there is xenophobia in Germany has never been doubted.
However, the right-wing extremist network discovered reveals an extent whose dimension has long been undetectable.
"Is the bloody ideology alive again?" were the headlines of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The Sabah newspaper, on the other hand, points out that one of the perpetrators was supposed to be a secret police officer of the department for the protection of the constitution and fears that German authorities could also be involved in a right-wing radical swamp.
The Turkish municipality of Germany reacted with caution: It recalled the weekend of demonstrations by silence in front of the Brandenburg Gate of the victims of racist violence.
Only two weeks ago, the Turkish municipality in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, recalled the fiftieth anniversary of the German-Turkish recruitment agreement.
In cheerful colors, a common life was staged - as a history of success.
Several Turkish media outlets have reported that "Germany's Gift to the Fifties" is the title of an article on the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which reports on the background of the murderous series.
Also, the publication of the newspaper "H<0xC3><0xBC>rriyet" for Germany can not be taken to not carry out this thought connection.
"It's starting to smell," is the headline of a column by Ahmet K<0xC3><0xBC>lahci.
He points out that the people who paid taxes were murdered, and that their work made an important contribution to the restoration of Germany.
The most critical is discussed in the German-Turkish Internet forums the police procedure and its late success in the search.
Why had the German authorities not thought long before to search for suspects in right-wing extremist circles, the authors wonder.
Thus, many are at least rhetorically willing to use drastic means: "If action is carried out here so superficially, immigrants will have nothing but their own defense and armaments."
"That'll probably be the best self-defense."
"The quality of clarification and the adequacy of the punishment of the entire network depends very strongly on the internal peace in Germany," writes "Selen".
What this means is that if the internal peace in Germany is threatened, the assassinations in M<0xC3><0xB6>lln and Solingen in the 1990s become clearer.
Photographs of the Solingen incinerator are deeply ingrained in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
For no other event has made it clearer to the Turks living here that there is a tangible threat and to the Germans that mistrust and dissent can lead to right-wing violence.
However, the attacks on the side of the Turks made a sense of reciprocity more apparent.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press was particularly critical of the failure of German policy after the assassinations: Helmut Kohl refused to visit those in M<0xC3><0xB6>lln who survived.
After the Solingen arson attack, he sent a sympathetic telegram to the Turkish state president, but at the funeral in Cologne he was represented by his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel then calculated in his speech what fees the Turks were paying.
It is as if the value of a person is measured by the amount of his taxes.
The current Turkish media coverage shows once again how deep the mistrust of many German Turks is in the country’s constitutional order.
In addition to the efforts to clarify and re-evaluate the right-wing extremist terrorism in Germany, this time it requires open words.
Scandalous bank near Lake Curia
The most prosperous bank in Europe is not based in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has suffered a near-bankruptcy during the financial crisis and has since moved from one crisis to another.
Now some German is going to compare it.
I'm sure Axel Weber didn't think so.
After his noisy departure from the leadership of the Federal Bank, it became known in July that he would take 2013 to an almost equally spectacular new job: the president of the board of directors of the Swiss giant bank UBS - an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber enjoyed himself in public, praised Switzerland for both its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity, and said friendly remarks to future colleagues.
"The UBS has reached a turnaround."
“I look forward to working with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel.”
But back in September, it was clear that everything would turn out completely differently.
One UBS dealer in London bypassed all of the bank’s security systems and wasted approximately <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.7 billion.
UBS CEO Oswald Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel, not only a Swiss banker, had to leave.
The chairman of UBS’s board of directors has also been on fire ever since – and everyone’s asking: When will Axel Weber finally come?
It has already become known that Weber Bank has been allowed to advise since February 2012.
And it will take over the chairmanship of the board in May - not just in 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
It's going to be tough for Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, he's a professor of economics and an emission banker, and he would definitely need time to work.
He will then take responsibility for the bank's strategy, which has just once proved that it deserves the title "Bank of the biggest scandals in Europe"
Because UBS is huge - until recently it was the largest asset manager in the world - and has been sliding from one scandal to another for years.
Nothing, it seems, will remain a proud Swiss bank spared.
It started with the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS enjoyed an excellent reputation.
The image of a secretive and solid, but also resourceful asset manager is combined with ambitious goals: She also wanted to mean something in investment banking.
On the one hand, UBS 2007 managed $1.6 trillion more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it has moved as an investment bank into the league of the world's largest banks
That made an impression.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and later long-time professor of banking in Zurich, tells us: “I always presented UBS to my students as an example of a good bank.”
"From today's point of view, one asks: How could I have been so wrong?"
He was wrong.
In 2007, it became clear for the first time that something had gone wrong at UBS.
In the middle of the year, the head of the board, Peter Wuffli, who was still considered a highly intelligent and also brilliant banker, resigned.
A few months later, he wondered why he had left.
The bank’s investment division had lost Subprime securities and had to write off billions.
In order to keep it stable, UBS has announced a capital increase of 13 billion francs.
However, she did find investors, but those above whom she would have recently covered her nose: an opaque Asian state fund from Singapore and an Arab state fund that was so discreet that one did not even know its name.
But that was just the first blow.
In April 2008, things got worse.
The bank had to admit new billion-dollar losses, the president of the board of directors Marcel Ospel, in 2006 still the second highest-paid board of directors in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster ensued: UBS stood by its misinvestment during the financial crisis before the collapse and had to be rescued by the state.
The Nationalbank bought from UBS for tens of billions of problematic securities, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs in mandatory convertible bonds, for which it could become a co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland has been shaken - for it has noticed how dramatic it is for a small country when it has such large banks in its territory.
After all, the balance sheet total of UBS 2007 was more than five times higher than the performance of the Swiss economy (see figure).
“Once again, we couldn’t save UBS,” says banking expert Geiger.
The first disaster is followed by the second.
For several months now, UBS has been capitulating to this in a tax dispute with America and has shown a willingness to release data on wealthy customers who have cut taxes as much as possible with the help of banks.
In addition, she agreed to pay $780 million - as a return of unauthorized profits from these trades, including a fine.
By doing so, UBS became more or less openly aware that it was helping to cut taxes.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been her capital in the competition for rich clients: the sanctity of discretion.
After this scandal, the Swiss banking secret was no longer what it used to be.
This was followed by the resignation of the Chairman of the Board of Directors and the Chairman of the Board of Directors.
And the exodus of customers' money.
Thus, within a few months, the bank lost its credibility in both central business areas: in investment banking due to bad speculation and in asset management to help reduce the tax.
And just as it calmed down a bit, just as UBS thought it was recovering again, here comes this unfortunate business adage: A single dealer wasted 1.7 billion euros before the bank realized something was wrong.
And it’s clear: with risk management in investment banking, this probably still doesn’t work.
“In the case of Adoboli, risk control has probably been found to have changed too little,” says Martin Janssen, an economist and finance professor of finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
Also, the chief financial officer of a large German bank is sure: “The problem with UBS is that it can’t manage risk control.”
Yet it was precisely this idea of prudence that the Swiss bankers used a long time ago to become the guardians of the world’s great assets: no too great risks, but security for money – on this side, too, the Alpine republic collapsed again.
The vaults of Swiss banks have become a symbol of unshakable reliability like Lindt and Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli for particularly high-quality chocolate.
UBS Zurich’s headquarters are still suited to the cliché of a good Swiss private bank – it’s just a little bigger.
The location is classic.
The bank has its headquarters in the Bahnhofstra<0xC3><0x9F>e in Zurich, which leads directly to Lake Zurich, which is framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are beautiful, the rents of shops are among the highest in Europe.
Jewellery such as Tiffany's can be found here among Swiss traditional shops such as Spr<0xC3><0xBC>ngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been based here for centuries: from the Nationalbank through the Palast der Credit Suisse to elite private banks such as Julius B<0xC3><0xA4>r.
The entrance to the reception hall UBS is through heavy revolving doors.
Inside, the walls are lined with marble, in front of them there are huge leather chairs, next to the bank logo a large signpost to the "safety box".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: security.
However, the Swiss banks, both Swiss big banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have sometimes suppressed or betrayed this idea, according to the head of a small Swiss private bank.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspapers, and eventually, like all Swiss bankers, he closes deals with both big banks.
UBS has probably grown too much, he finds - especially in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have expanded.
The Swiss have nothing to say about it.
"And if they did, they'd adapted to Anglo-Saxon ways long ago."
Indeed, it was Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, which at first brought it high profits and then disaster: No European financial institution lost as much money in the jungle around Subprime as Schweizer Gro<0xC3><0x9F>bank.
On October 15, 2008, the disaster was apparent.
"On that Wednesday, the government coalition of a small seven-million-strong country decided to take the biggest rescue in the history of its nation," author Lukas H<0xC3><0xA4>ssig writes in his book Der UBS-Crash.
As much as 68 billion francs, or about 45 billion euros, have been approved by politicians to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How could this happen?
If you talk to Swiss bankers, you see a problem mainly in the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss large banks merged into a major group.
A bank was set up that was already too big for a small Switzerland at the time of the merger – and continued to grow.
At the same time, it helped that the two different banking predecessors of UBS complemented each other: One wealthy but sleepy bank in Zurich with a focus on asset management and the poorer, but internationally more strongly involved.
Suddenly, internationalized investment bankers came to the advantage of a lot of money, with which they could spin a big roulette.
Two names are associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, CEO of UBS from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then Chairman of the Board of Directors.
“I always thought that Wuffli and Ospel were the team of the future,” says bank expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffle, the highly intelligent, modest man who knows a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the man who manages his feelings around his stomach, who has grown up completely from banking science."
But Ospel said he relied on Wuffli to the end.
And Wuffli probably made the decisive mistake in the end: “He probably thought his models were real,” Geiger says.
"This is a tragic case."
Tragic, perhaps.
It is clear: Pride preceded the fall.
UBS employees clearly remember the meetings of executives, at which the head of the group Wuffli repeated the same slogan over and over again: to bring Goldman Sachs down from the throne.
The Bank of America was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
She cited "League Tables", an agenda documenting the banks' success at the time.
In it, UBS tried to position itself at the very top.
She has already taken a few steps.
In the foreign exchange and stock market, she participated in the game at the very top.
However, the business advisers, who were entrusted with the task, emphasize one weakness: In international interest-rate trading, in the words of the bankers "Fixed Income", there is probably a large gap behind the largest banks.
UBS has some gaps in U.S. mortgage products.
To close this gap, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Hungry for growth, both the bank itself and its hedge fund invested in U.S. Subprime investments.
It developed into a powerful machine that repackaged securities into U.S. mortgage loans and passed on – but also kept the risks to itself.
Even when other banks have been looking for a way out for a long time.
“Back in the summer of 2007, when the real estate market was on fire, UBS was buying there,” says banking expert Geiger.
How big is the euphoria, how deep the fall.
One manager after another had to leave when attempts to clean up were more difficult than previously thought.
The positions at UBS have become a catapulting seat and are still swinging today.
Whoever runs the big bank now has an almost unmanageable job.
He must find a strategy for the bank that all nearby business models have disappeared.
The banking expert Geiger already has an idea: an end to investment banking, a concentration on asset management, a return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go that far.
But investment banking is expected to decline sharply, so much is now clear.
Next Thursday, the new head of the bank Sergio Ermotti wants to present his future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Swiss Italian was actually only seen as a transitional solution when the bank surprisingly broke up with its predecessor, Gr<0xC3><0xBC>bel.
In the meantime, he said: He has to run UBS stores for a long time, the Curonian Spit bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to put the investment bank back on track in the mid-1990s.
3500 seats will be cut.
But that won't be enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What does he want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is already asking himself.
But he says in public that he and his wife will first find an apartment in Zurich.
Next year.
Fear of a recession in Europe weighs heavily on the U.S. stock market.
The looming recession in Europe has stripped U.S. investors of the courage to start the week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome did not achieve the intended striking effect.
The subdued production of industry on the continent has suffocated the seeds of hope for stabilizing the debt crisis.
The general facilitation of the exchange of government in Rome and Athens could not be promoted.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
Italian and Greek glass were considered half-full, not half-empty last week – but now they’re in the forefront again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
Above all, financial values were on the sales cards.

In Frankfurt, Dax said goodbye with a decrease of 1.2 percent at 5,985 meters.
The industry in 17 countries using the euro has significantly reduced its production and is preparing to end the boom.
Enterprises produced two per cent less in September than in the month before, according to Eurostat.
"We're not an island, we're dependent," said Steve Goldman of Goldman's management.
Europe is probably not recovering from the recession so quickly, in addition, there are other signs of bank weakness.
The investment legend Warren Buffett just confirmed this prospect: He said in a CNBC interview that it was not yet clear whether Europe was strong enough to do anything to end the crisis.
Therefore, from his point of view, it is probably too early to invest in European government loans or banks.
Instead, Buffett abandoned the decades-old principle and entered the U.S. tech industry.
His investment of more than $10 billion in IBM boosted the traditional group’s share price and led it to be quoted almost one percent higher against the trend during trading first.
The paper ended almost unchanged at $187.35.
Buffett paid an average of $170 per piece, according to his own data, and is now holding 5.5%.
His investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.

Smart Crows Are Spreading in Cities
In many places, ravens are considered "problem birds": However, these highly intelligent animals can no longer be evicted from cities, experts say.
Some like them, others like to get rid of them quite quickly: crows have been part of the image of the city for centuries, yet in some municipalities complaints of dirt and noise caused by animals accumulate.
However, there is still no way to deal with "problem birds".
Field ravines may no longer be ejected from cities, experts said at the first symposium on ravines in East Frisian Leer.
There, experts from all over the federal territory consulted on possible starting points.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Nature conservationists have also derived the problems of cities from the exodus of specially protected field ravines: the use of chemistry in agriculture is increasingly destroying traditional areas for life.
Persecution, growing outcrops, and cutting down typical trees to nest birds make life difficult.
The crows are protected.
Large colonies with more than 600 nesting pairs are found in the Westphalian Soest, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim near Bremen and in Leer.
There, in 2005, the controversial project of mass killing of crows in the rural district caused negative headlines.
Critics called the capture of animals in bird traps and the killing of bats particularly brutal.
"Normal expulsion, frightening, brings nothing," said urbanist and landscaper Werner Kl<0xC3><0xB6>ver of Leer.
Removing nests by spraying water or cutting down trees often has undesired consequences, environmental expert Manfred Kaiser of Lahru in Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg said.
"Animals retreat, large colonies split and divide into other places."
Scaring is only conceivable as an exception at hospitals, retirement homes or schools.
"We have to live with them, we won't get them away."
Without the surrounding area, the problem of cities cannot be solved, was the opinion of the mayor Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
It is conceivable to combine the expulsion of animals from sensitive residential areas and their attraction to settle in other places.
"Information boards instead of chain saws" was promoted by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens because of a completely different treatment of animals: "One bite in the face can best end up with self-confidence."
Mrs. J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens co-founded the Ascherberg Science Trail in Schleswig-Holstein, where information boards provide lessons on the life of a highly intelligent field raven.
The project is said to have already received tourists.
Mrs. J<0xC3><0xBC>rgens also had her own opinion on the criticism of the noise caused by the bird: "This is about every volume of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and dexterity of the animals are legendary: the ravens of the field not only use the aid to reach the monument, but even make their instrument as a tool.
Researchers from the University of Cambridge recently tested the behavior of four ravens of the field, how far the intelligence of birds reaches.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that stones must cause the structure to collapse in order to get to the mole larvae.
Without much training, they knew what size and shape a stone must have to cause the platform to collapse.
In the second attempt, the lubricated crows then had to solve a more hectic problem.
In a vertically constructed cylinder, the researchers placed a small container with a mole larvae.
The birds could not reach their prey with their beaks.
However, the researchers placed pieces of wire there.
Of these, all four animals formed hooks, with which she used as a catcher to catch a container for a handle from the tube.
Three of the four field ravines even managed to break through.
Cristiano Ronaldo to shoot Portugal for European Championship 2012
The hopes of the Bosnians and Turks did not come to fruition.
Favorites Portugal, Croatia, Czech Republic and Ireland take part in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland won their last tickets to the 2012 European Championships in Poland and Ukraine.
Led by twice-successful superstar Cristiano Ronaldo (8th, 53rd), Portugal defeated Bosnia-Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1) and made the fifth consecutive participation in the European Championship perfect after the score of 0:0 in the first match.
The Czechs had enough in the play-off with outsider <0xC4><0x8C>ern<0xC3><0xA1> Hora score 1: 0 (0: 0), when the first match was already a clear thing.
Croatia also failed to score 0–0 against Turkey, with Ireland reaching a free-kick 1:1 (1–0) against Estonia.
Nani (24th), Helder Postiga (72nd, 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored more goals for Portugal.
Former Wolfsburg professional from the League Zvezdan Misimovic turned penalty (41) and captain Emir Spahic (65) twice reduced for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic received a yellow-red card (54).
Bosnia has already disappointed in the play-offs for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa with Portugal.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal made a peaceful start.
Ronaldo soon reached the lead by hanging a free kick from about 30 meters into the net.
About a good quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his qualities in shooting at a great distance and adjusted the shot from 25 meters to 2:0.
The Bosniaks, who failed in the first half, had their first clear chance at goalkeeper Edin Dzek.
Former English player Wolfsbur at the head of Manchester City's standing table put the ball on the bottom edge of the bar, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33rd).
Jiracek scores for Czech Republic
Finally, Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding was at the centre.
After the attack on Helder Postig in the Bosnian criminal territory, Stark decided for Schwalbe and gave the Portuguese a yellow card. (36).
On the other hand, Stark carried out a controversial criminal coup after the action of Fabio Coentra, which Misimovic certainly transformed.
But after the break, the European vice-champion from 2004 clarified everything with four hits.
For the Czech Republic, Petr Jiracek also ended his last doubts in the 81st minute.
With this, the European champion from 1976 leaves for the European Championship for the fifth time in a row.
However, the team of coach Michal Bilk with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Pekhart (1st FC Nuremberg) was also lucky and had to overcome a terrible second in the initial stage.
Goalkeeper Petr <0xC4><0x8C>ech reflexively prevented Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Sivok (9th) from reaching his own goal at the last moment.
Montenegro had its biggest chances when the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic were in action.
In the 40th minute, Damjanovic fired from a turn from the border of the criminal territory just around the <0xC4><0x8C>ech gate.
After the break, the crossbar had to be saved instead of the already beaten Czech World-class goalkeeper, again reduced by the striker FC Soul (50th).
Shortly before the conclusion, Branka finally clarified everything.
At that moment, Turkey missed the football miracle from Zagreb.
Four days after 0:3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not exceed 0:0 in Zagreb.
While national coach Guus Hiddink is almost certain of his place on the bench of the third at the 2002 World Cup, Croatia can be pleased with his fourth participation in the final round of the European Championship.
In front of 31,000 spectators at Maksimir Stadium, the Turks should experience an almost fairy-tale start.
Selcuk Inan hit only a stick in the seventh minute with a long-range shot, the attacker Kazim also could not hang the reflected ball in the margin.
After this terrible second, however, Croatia continued to take control to a greater extent.
Even after the interruption, the Croats did not get a goal.
In addition to Mario Mandzukice from VfL Wolfsburg, who released the Dortmund Ivan Perisice from the 62nd minute, there were still legionnaires from the League Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt).
Trapattoni goes to the European Championship
In Dublin, the Irish celebrated their first participation in the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward brought coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, which managed to score 4-0 in the first match of the preliminary decision, into the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vasilyev (57) equalized for the guests.
Ireland set the pace from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute before Robbie Keane of the Los Angeles Galaxy had his first good chance.
Only at the last minute did the Estonian defense prevent a possible leading edge.
In the 32nd minute, it was a long way off.
After an unsuccessful defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londaka, Ward was on the spot and pushed the ball over the line to a state of 1:0.

Hungry labrador turned on the stove stove - a fire broke out in the apartment
The hungry dog apparently caused a fire in an apartment in Brandenburg/Havel.
Labrador likely jumped on the stove to reach for the food, police said on Friday.
At the same time, he probably moved the switch and turned on one of the stoves.
The paper on the stove caught fire.
In the apartment on the fourth floor of a family house for multiple families, a fire broke out on Thursday morning.
The dog died as a result of smoke poisoning.
The 18-year-old tenant, who was not in the apartment during the fire, is being investigated for setting up the fire out of carelessness.

SAP wants to double the number of its employees in China.
Europe’s largest software manufacturer, SAP, is investing billions in China in the coming years and wants to almost double its workforce in the country.
By 2015, it will be worth about two billion dollars (about 1.5 billion euros), Dax said on Tuesday.
“We will create more R&D facilities and employ the right people,” said Bill McDermott, chief executive of the company, at a customer fair in Beijing.
The workforce now has an increase from the current 2,500 employees to 4,500.
The number of offices in the world’s leading software for enterprises doubles from five to ten or eleven.
So far, SAP is present in Beijing, Shanghai, Guanzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
About 4,000 of the world’s more than 176,000 SAP customers are in a booming country.
Growth plans in China are also an important building block of Dax’s 2015 strategy.
SAP aims to increase its turnover to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion by 2015.
Last year, the Walldorfers lost about 12.5 billion euros.
Currently, the company’s software business, which employs 55,000 people worldwide, is running as well as almost never before.
SAP has been active in China for 20 years.
"Now we would like to expand our activities (...)," McDermott said.
“Our goal is, with the support of extensive research, to support sustainable growth in China.”
Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s emotionally powerful new book, Beauty and the Sorrow: The Confidential History of World War I (The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War), begins with a long list of characters coming out of it.
One tip on how to behave at the moment: Carefully tear out this page and make a bookmark out of it.
You will get to know all the people in Mr. Englund's novel, and this list will serve as a navigation - as a beacon - at a time when, like the men and women in the story, you will feel confused and lost in different situations.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also a new deputy at the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize for Literature.
The book we are talking about here is very unusual - the author himself describes it, quite accurately, as an "anti-historical work".
It contains several very well-known names, important contracts or famous battles, on the contrary, it almost lacks ambassadors, energetic journalists and debates about tactics and equipment.
It is not even a book about what happened, explains the author, but rather "a book about what it was like". It deals mainly with "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"Beauty and Sorrow" combines the war experience of 20 fewer dozen men and women on both sides of the barricade, from students and botanists to climbers, doctors, rescue drivers and officials.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Others become prisoners of war, lose limbs, go mad, or die.
Their lives flicker like flames of candles lit in the church - new ones are added to the entanglement of fate, while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is different from the classic historical novels.
He edits the idea that the First World War was all about the terrible trench battles on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully explores other places where war dramas took place: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
Soldiers in this book solve problems with the bee's nest falling on them, having to spend Christmas in the shade of the pyramids or struggling with the presence of tse-tse flies.
From the very beginning, it was a very touching read.
War devours people's lives like some natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling like gunpowder.
When gunfire starts ringing in the distance and you're the woman who's home with your kids, will you run away or stay?
Who's really getting close?
Almost no one understands what’s going on, not even why the whole war was started.
"A vacuum created by a lack of facts," observed Mr. Englund, "was filled with conjectures, suppositions, hopes, fears, prejudices, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares, and rumors."
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows the stories of individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor serving in the German fleet.
Their stories are taken from biographies, letters, and other already published materials.
The descriptions of their lives may sound scary and enticing, but thanks to the inclusion of small moments and details, they are absolutely vivid and believable.
Many of them deal with suffering and coping with it.
In the story of a German student, the author says: "Replacements, everywhere substitutes."
"Café apron, aluminum imitation, rubber imitation, paper bandages, wooden buttons."
It goes even further and describes food substitutes in Germany.
It refers to "meat made from pressed rice cooked in rind fat (and supplemented with a fake wooden bone), tobacco from dried roots and dried potato peels, shoes with wooden soles".
He mentions that there were "837 registered meat substitutes in the production of sausages and 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and bravery.
An American finds an inner urge to savagery and brutality, and then declares war: "In the end, you will understand that this is human nature, not sitting in comfortable armchairs with a cigarette and a whisky, in the evening newspapers or in a good book, pretending to be a Jew, and pretending to be a Jew.
On the contrary, the British soldier realizes that he is most likely going to die soon and no one will even notice, let alone grieve.
"When a person finally comes to terms with sacrificing himself, he would at least expect it to happen in front of a grateful audience," he writes.
Instead, he feels like a “convict who is secretly hanged.”
Other remarks concern the departure of the old Europe and the emergence of new horrors.
"Conflict has increasingly become an economic competition and a competitive struggle," writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories."
He captured what he calls “a new kind of beast of the coming century: a eloquent and ideologically sworn mass murderer in tailor-made clothes who carries out his bloodshed without getting up from the table.”
People behave completely unexpectedly, insidiousness alternates with heroism.
Mr. Englund also describes soldiers who deliberately tried to catch some kind of sexual illness from prostitutes in order to avoid serving on the front lines.
“The most glaring example of this behavior was the gonococcal pus trade that soldiers bought and rubbed their genitals with in the hope that it would end up in a hospital,” he wrote.
"The most desperate of them had him in their eyes, which often blinded them for the rest of their lives."
In this translation from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is shrewd, but it does not prove anything, which is perfectly suited to his human subject.
In dozens of small outputs, he captures the way the war “dissolved absolutely uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are forced to fight.
The best books about the First World War mostly worked with hints, such as "World War I and Modern Memories" by Paul Fussell or novels like "On the Western Front of Peace" by Erich Maria Remarque.
Mr. Englund prefers an unconventional concept.
His book has the most shattering endings, which are unprecedented in popular scholarly literature.
But I will not reveal it to you.
However, you will feel as if the author suddenly jumped out of the book, ripped the page from your list of heroes out of your hand and set it on fire.
After the previous mistake this time for a minute precisely planned rake
It was attended by hundreds of police officers, some in helmets used in street riots.
The night from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because at that time Zuccotti Park should be almost empty.
Nobody knew about the event except a few high-ranking officers, the others being told at first that it was an exercise.
At the head of the event was Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, whose presence emphasized how many problems the police department had to face during the operation.
Cases from recent weeks, such as the use of pepper sprays against demonstrators, should not be repeated, which violated the rules of the department and, in addition, a wave of public sympathy spilled over to the squatters.
Therefore, a police operation aimed at clearing Zuccotti Park of protesters was launched after two weeks of careful planning and exercise.
The leaders were inspired by the operations that took place in other cities.
A massive exercise for behavior in crisis situations took place in the Randalls Island area, which was preparing for action in Zuccotti Park.
Senior officials have stepped up so-called riot control training — counter-terrorism measures involving the rapid transfer of large numbers of police officers — focusing on the urban area of Lower Manhattan.
The last part of the training took place on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The orders to move to the park came literally "at the last minute" said someone to whom the action was originally explained only as "exercise".
"I know a few police officers who were also called to this event, and certainly no one told them that they were going to Zuccotti Park," said the person, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
"The only people who knew he was going to Zuccotti Park were the top-ranked members of the department."
One of the reasons for the secrecy was the lesson that the city has already received once.
On October 14, the city officials planned to clear the park, but then withdrew from the plan, because as soon as the protesters heard about it, they had collected hundreds of them before the start of the operation in the park.
Tuesday’s event was attended by police officers from various units, including intervention groups from around the area – dozens of police officers who are commonly used to strengthen neighborhoods with higher levels of crime.
Mr. Kelly explained that during the day a large number of people come and go to the park, so one hour at night was the ideal time to start the action.
"It was appropriate to do this at a time when there would be as few people in the park as possible," he said.
Before the units left, they lined up on the border of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, trucks of emergency units with arc lamps and amplions.
The lights and the recorded message roaring from the amphibians frightened many demonstrators.
When members of the security forces entered the park in their blue gusts, many demonstrators packed their belongings and left.
Police say they didn’t touch a single tent until 1:45 a.m., giving protesters time to pack up their belongings.
Other teams of police officers were seen gathering on the edge of the park so they could break into it if any arrests were needed.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Police Department spokesman Paul J. Browne said it was for their safety.
However, many journalists are of the opinion that the police wanted to prevent them from seeing their units in action, and in addition, some police officers behaved rudely towards them.
Mr. Browne claimed that the television cars on Church Street leading along the park’s western border could shoot without problems.
The police were moving westwards and tangled in a dense confusion of protesters’ personal belongings, including luggage and needle bags full of clothes, followed by teams from the hygiene department, who immediately scrapped everything left in the park.
Some of the protesters who refused to move were dragged out of the park, and the documentary footage appeared on the Internet a few moments later.
The greenest group of protesters took refuge near the kitchen in their camp, which was located near the center of the park.
Some formed a blockade and the police began their methodical arrest.
About ten people in the center of the camp tied themselves to each other.
And two people tied themselves to the tree, Mr. Kelly said.
Members of the emergency services were called in to cut through the locks.
No arrests were made until 3:30 a.m. at the park, Mr. Kelly said.
The entire operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr Browne said about 142 people were detained in the park.
Most of the arrests took place because of "organizing riots and putting resistance in arrest," he explained.
The highest-ranking police officer at the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the commander of the police department, the highest-ranking uniformed officer in the department.
The operation was also personally attended by Phil T. Pulaski, the head of detectives at the department.
Mr. Kelly was present, but "didn't participate in the management of the operation," Mr. Browne said.
A second group of police officers waited along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case it needed to be called.
On Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south of the park, the barriers were erected.
From these places, the police developed a protective belt even further from Zuccotti Park.
In one place, police officers were seen, many of whom were equipped with shields, pushing people further beyond the border.
There were about 28 people on the northern border.
The wildest events of the night took place south of the park.
At about five o’clock in the morning, a protester south of Pine Street was seen jumping on the hood of a police car, and several others were evacuating air from police van tires.
At one point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
At the end of the operation, one policeman and one protester were hospitalized.
The union of auxiliary workers will sue the city for dismissal
The unions representing the hundreds of school helpers who lost their jobs last month are planning to sue the city on Wednesday. They claim that the dismissal was not necessary and, moreover, it was about discrimination, due to the disproportionate impact on schools attended by poor students.
The judicial review is probably the last option that the District Council 37 trade unions have left in their efforts to reverse the dismissal decision.
On October 7, six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parents’ coordinators and other employees, who were among the city’s worst paid employees, lost their jobs. Their dismissals were described by the union leaders as retribution for the city’s failure last spring to grant him access to health care.
City officials have categorically denied the allegation.
At a city council meeting last month, education minister Dennis M. Walcott said the release was part of a budget approved in June.
One of the members of the council immediately disputed the fact that the budget did not mention the release of aid workers in any specific way.
District Council 37 officials announced that they had already filled in the necessary documents and warned the Department of Education that they would sue him. On Wednesday, they will convene a press conference where they will formally announce the lawsuit at the Manhattan Supreme Court.
The defendants in the lawsuit will be Mr. Walcott and the Department of Education, while the plaintiff side will be eight dismissed workers, all of whom are African-American or Hispanic, as well as most of the other assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city had not yet seen the lawsuit and would not comment on individual charges.
According to a complaint filed by the New York Times, the unions focused on the number of people released in poor parts of the city to support their claims of unfair treatment, because they believe that poor schools have lost more assistants because they have been denied funding for a long time.
They point out that while schools in the Staten Island area did not drop out at all and in the Upper East Side area at least, in Brooklyn, in the District 23 area in Brownsville, 17 school assistants were lost, and in the District 8 and 9 areas in the South Bronx, 46 assistants were even released.
He recalls that at Public School 36 in Harlem, five out of eight assistants lost their jobs, despite the fact that it is a school where 68 percent of students live in poverty. The lawsuit says: "It is not a neighborhood full of mobile parents who can afford to make up for the budget deficit."
Public School 36’s budget was cut by 3.26% this year, and the school also lost money when the city changed the way bonus funds are calculated for every enrolled poor student.
The unions, among other things, claim that the principals of secondary schools could have been confused in the way in which a document approving the dismissal of the parental coordinators was written.
The document used the word "excess" to describe the event, i.e. to cancel the position, although this word is much more often used to describe the transfer of the teacher from the school payroll to the database of available workers whose salary is paid by the central authority.
"Sixty-six parental coordinators have been released," the complaint states, "and not just moved to the available staff position in the database."
The mission is over, Congress is ready to accept an agreement on the situation in Libya
Finally, it seems that the Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree on something regarding the uprising in Libya.
But before that happened, the revolution had to succeed, the long-ruling dictator Muammar Gaddafi had to be captured and killed, and the participation of the United States forces ended.
On Tuesday, the Senate's International Relations Commission will decide on a statement supported by President John Kerry (Mass.) along with Senators John McCain (Ariz.) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conn.), in which it should congratulate the Libyans on their successful uprising and "for American unity".
“With this statement, we want to appreciate the courage of the people of Libya who started rebuilding their country,” Kerry said.
"Both sides of the political spectrum would like to express their support for their democratic efforts."
The above-mentioned sentences may seem innocent, but no debate on Libya has been easy until now.
Over the years, lawmakers from both sides have been arguing with each other and the White House over the wording of a series of statements to approve or reject the United States’ military role in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The proposal was rejected in the House because of differences of opinion between the two political parties, so it was never voted on in the Senate.
However, on the same day that the motion was rejected in the House, the House also rejected measures that would stop funding U.S. operations in Libya.
By doing so, the U.S. mission in Libya found itself literally in the legislative clearinghouse — Congress has criticized the way President Obama runs the mission, but apparently its members haven’t bothered it enough to stop supporting him in his actions.
The Congressional heaviness was eventually preceded by other events.
The rebels captured Tripoli in August and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31st.
The Senate may now be ready to act.
In its statement, the International Relations Commission "congratulates the people of Libya for their immense courage and admirable tenacity in their efforts to liberate their people" and "praises the men and women of the armed forces of the United States and their allies who have engaged in an operation to protect the Libyan people."
The statement also "confirms the national interest of the United States in the successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new proposal receive full support from the Commission on International Relations, or will the legislators be split again in two, as was the case when the June proposal was approved?
The last version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Ind.), the chief representative of the Republican Party in the commission.
Lugar's spokesman said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new proposal.
The House will vote this week on an amendment to the Constitution that would require a balanced budget, which should be the top legislative priority of almost all Republicans and Democrats in Congress.
This measure, advocated by Bob Goodlatt (Va.), will be the first addition to the Constitution concerning a budget or other subject on which the entire House or Senate will vote.
For the time being, the other legislators, despite considerable efforts, have not yet succeeded in pushing their proposals to the very vote.
Goodlatt's proposal is just one of 68 amendments to the constitution that were introduced in Congress and touched on a wide range of different topics.
Some of them were the same - the same proposal submitted to the House and the Senate - and others are just small exchanges of others.
Only in the House can you find at least 15 versions of the balanced budget addendum and another handful that would like to "regulate federal spending".
Some of the proposals are identical, but their proponents — especially beginning Republicans who want to improve their reputations — can boast of their “authorship.”
The revenue on the regulation of the budget, which was approved in August, required the House and the Senate to vote on the addition to the balanced budget.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding declaration in support of the creation of such an addendum.
In addition to the budget, several members want to discuss restrictions on the number of periods in which members of Congress could serve, while José E. Serrano (N.Y.) wants to increase the number of periods that may be in office as president.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Ill.) offered a number of supplements that would guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and medical care.
The permanent proposal remains an addendum prohibiting same-sex marriage and an addendum prohibiting the burning of the state flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws in the event that two-thirds of states oppose them.
Although members of Congress seem to be very active in designing various add-ons, they are not significantly out of the ordinary compared to previous years.
In the 111th Congress they offered 77 additions, while in the 100th Congress there were 66.
Their activity even pales in comparison to the early 1990s, when, according to the statistics of the Senate Library, members offered more than 150 additions every two years.
However, they were not much more successful than current politicians.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th amendment - was ratified in 1992, but in fact it was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Broken but not defeated," Gifford said in her first television interview since the shooting.
Ten months after being shot from close range by a gunman at a public meeting with voters in Tucson, Gabrielle Gifffords (Ariz.) turned up on national television on Monday night, singing along with the tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Out to Kong Tomorrow" that she had not heard.
Giffords appeared on "20/20" on ABC News with Diane Sawyer, and it was obvious that the creation of sentences was still making trouble for her and she needed help walking.
The entire show documented her difficult recovery, which was necessary due to a bullet wound that punctured her skull in front, pierced her left half of her brain, and came out of her head in the back.
Three months ago, she surprisingly returned to the House to participate triumphantly in the vote on the debt ceiling.
In her first television interview since the January shooting that killed six people and injured 13 others, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — describing her recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked her how she was feeling, Giffords, 40, said, "Pretty good."
An interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special for the show "20/20", which aired on the eve of the couple's new book, entitled "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special tracked Gifford's entire recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In the videos that Kelly shot during the first week, Giffords is seen in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar all over her forehead.
While her husband encourages her, she can’t do more than lift one or two fingers at a time.
A few months later, Giffords is caught sitting in a wheelchair and is taught by therapists how to perform simple activities.
Kissing his head.
Swelling of the lips.
And then, her first word: "What."
Within a few days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast" when she demanded changes in her breakfast.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that music played a key role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman sings on them together with a therapist on the tunes to the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Fallin" by Tom Petty.
During an interview with Gifford, who spends two hours a day on therapy, Sawyer revealed that she doesn't remember anything from the day she was shot.
Her husband said Gifford had read the newspaper articles about the shooting until March 12, when she first asked him who the six who were killed in the incident were.
The shooter is Jared Lee Loughner, who is being held in a Missouri prison where he is awaiting trial under the influence of violent drugs.
"A lot of people have died," Giffords said to the Sawyers.
"Terrible, terrible, terrible."
Kelly Sawyer revealed that at one point during his recovery, his wife said, "I lost."
"So I told her right away: Gabby, you didn't lose," Kelly described.
"You just got hit.
But you can do it, you can put yourself together and you can come back even stronger than ever before.”
Military units meet with compassion rather than with respect.
The event was a gala night on Wall Street that raised millions of dollars for war veterans in New York who don’t have a roof over their heads.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about powerlessness, frustration, and loss.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines gathered around him.
The festively dressed crowd stood up and applauded enthusiastically.
"Men and women serving in the military were considered heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized the spring benefit.
In addition to Admiral Mike Mullen, who saw the role of the military units somewhat differently, the then Chairman of the Committee of Chiefs of Staff attended the ceremony.
"They were all introduced as orphans," the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers thought that well.
I know you do.
But what I saw was not respect, it was regret.
So completely opposite impressions only illustrate the difficult relationship between the army and the often measured, sometimes celebratory, American public.
The army is boundless with praise for its victims.
But this praise is worth something, say the soldiers.
The public is behaving more and more as if they were pitying an individual in uniform.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way some can support us is to put us in the role of unhappy souls."
This topic is very sensitive to army commanders who do not want to look ungrateful or spoil their relationships with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that the troops returning from Vietnam had to face was much worse.
As a result, most of the words of regret are spoken in silence and in privacy among war veterans.
When the two sons of retired Colonel Mark Cancian returned from combat operations, where they served as members of the Marine Corps, their father warned them that people outside the army would look at their service from two angles.
From the point of view of some, he will feel respect and wonder, because they defeated the enemy insurgents and visited exotic places.
But others will be puzzled if “a bad, violent veteran is not hiding under the surface,” said Cancian, who took part in the fighting in Iraq and took his place in Washington’s government upon his return.
He claimed that when he was looking for a job, some of the people who interviewed him inconspicuously suggested that he could resist the stress associated with working in Washington so soon after returning from a fight.
“When you talk about your service, you have to count on negative reactions,” Cancian taught his sons.
The concern of the military stems in part from American indifference to war.
Successes on the battlefield rarely garner recognition in a country that has little awareness of its own army and finds little of its own benefit in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"As a nation, we no longer value military heroism as it was common during World War II," said Lt. Gen. David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the recognition by politicians and the public is focused mainly on the suffering of men in arms.
Soldiers are awarded for the number of actions they have suffered, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The military is facing increasing pressure to take tough action against rape.
This week, it will be decided whether to open a trial of 28 women and men against the army for alleged inaction in the event of rape.
If not, hundreds of other plaintiffs are prepared to file a lawsuit.
The soldier's first class Elizabeth Lyman was raped on the night she was allegedly raped by her army colleague, 25 years old, and was in her 11th week of pregnancy.
It happened in October 2008 and she was heading to the barracks at the Miramar air base north of San Diego. After dinner with a friend she ran into her male colleague carrying a box of 12 beers.
He asked her if she could join him so they could have a drink in her room.
"There was a warning light in my head," Lyman said.
But the native Texasan completely ignored her objections.
I thought, “No, he’s 19.
"He's from Texas," she said.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts."
She claims that just a few minutes after they entered her room, a man walked over to her, threw her on the bed and raped her.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current or former members of the military will wait for a hearing verdict that could have a historic impact. This will take place in Arlington, Virginia, and it will be about whether the charges against former defense minister Robert Gates will be brought against him.
The indictment alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to combat the spread of rape in the military, which is contrary to the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The indictment was filed in February by Washington lawyer Susan Burke, and the plaintiff had 17 members at the time. However, over the following months, the number of defendants increased to 28-25 women and three men, all of whom claim to have been raped or otherwise sexually assaulted by their co-workers in the past.
Burke says he's going after the highest-ranking army commanders because the problem starts with them.
"The military is a directive system," he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position that they can prevent efforts to put in place measures against such acts?"
Burke also says she has contacted at least 400 other survivors since February, many of whom could become part of other lawsuits filed in the future.
Her strategy: Rather than pooling all the charges into this case — stacking all the eggs in one basket, as she says — she will file lawsuits in multiple different cases if pressure doesn’t need to be eased.
The defense team is led by U.S. Attorney Neil MacBride, who along with his colleagues has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek detail the defense’s strategy – essentially that current or former soldiers cannot sue the military for injuries they suffered as members of the armed forces.
Under a 1950 Supreme Court order called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for injuries suffered by soldiers in active service.
"The alleged injuries relate to the military service of the plaintiffs," the document reads.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on the matter.
But things have changed since the 1950s.
Although women are still not officially allowed to serve in combat, it is only a matter of vocabulary: in modern wars, it is difficult to find clearly defined front lines.
In the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, teams of female soldiers played an increasingly prominent role, especially in the area of communication with civilian women in the war zone.
The result: 150 female soldiers fell between these wars - two-thirds of them directly in battle.
The time has come to modernize the military, Burke explains.
She's not alone in her fight, and three other lawyers are involved.
At Yale Law School, visitors to the Veterans Legal Services Seminar are preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for allegedly developing an atmosphere that fosters hatred for women.
Regardless, the non-profit organization of American Vietnamese veterans collects the evidence for its lawsuit against the Army. This lawsuit focuses on the diagnosis of "personality disorder" that was allegedly detected in the victims of rape in order for the Army to have a pretext for their release, according to Ankwa.
In December, her group filed a lawsuit against the state organization for dealing with veterans, accusing them of discriminatory practices that were supposed to occur when processing requests for help from people who claimed to have been sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate proposals were presented to Congress by a group of senators and MPs from both political parties, proposing a range of corrective measures.
According to the Office for the Prevention and Resolution of Sexual Violence, 3,158 sexual assaults were reported in 2010.
However, this type of attack remains unreported in most cases, and according to the Pentagon’s own estimates this number corresponds to approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred in that year.
The report, released in March, also discusses the level of criminal prosecution of suspects: In 2010, 20 percent of cases reported to the military were brought to court - half of them against the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the case of Deputy Burke only describe the attacks as the first of a number of traumas.
For example, the first-class soldier Lyman reported alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it was supposed to occur.
During the night, she says, she was asked to repeat details of her rape eleven times to various police officers, doctors and commanders.
She underwent all the necessary examinations to determine rape, and in her bed was found the blood of the assailant - from the wound she had made on his arm.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was heard in court, during which she was asked questions about whether she was in love with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six persons were summoned to testify as eyewitnesses in favor of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day he was sentenced," Lyman said.
"I felt like I was giving birth right there on the spot - I ran out of the courtroom screaming."
"They put me in a psychiatric unit, and when I got out, I remember saying to my commanding officer, 'That wasn't his trial. It was mine.'
The Lymans were ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, making her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was discharged from the army without honor and therefore without any claim to service.
Whether the case of Lyman and the other plaintiffs moves to the next phase or not, it’s a long-distance run, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law University.
However, he notes, "From my point of view, they should be able to move on to the next stages of negotiations."
Between them and the verdict, however, stands the doctrine mentioned, which has been criticized since the first moment she saw the light of the world.
I myself am a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is several decades behind, because their duties do not allow to adhere to the same level of motivational incentives and deterrents.
He adds, "The odds are hard against them... but it's important for them to try."
Change only happens when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing is not decided in their favor, Burkevo<0xC3><0xA1>, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, will gather hundreds of other people prepared to file a lawsuit and begin working on other cases related to the subject.
"We will not stop fighting with the army on this issue, where there will be no reform," he says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Scientists Are Examining You on Facebook
Before Anders Behring Breivik became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, he was just another young man presenting his anti-immigrant views on the internet.
On Monday, Braivik, who confessed to a July murderous rampage that left 77 dead in Norway, attended his first public court hearing.
Although Breivik could act alone, he was definitely not alone in cyberspace: he spent a lot of time at the computer during the preparation of the attack, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists supporting right-wing groups on social media sites.
After this summer’s tragedy, scientists want to learn more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - just go to Facebook.
“We realized that getting them isn’t that hard at all,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report by a British research team on European digital populism.
The amount of personal information on Facebook is so vast, Bartlett says, that it was enough for scientists to simply take advantage of the ad on the site and, as a result, pinpoint the demographic group they were looking for – something that marketers have been doing for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe, and they focused their attention on them and sent out advertisements to them. But instead of inviting them to join a newly formed group or offering them some diet products, they encouraged them to fill them out.
Through Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues managed to get results from more than 10,000 fans from 14 different right-wing groups in 11 European countries – without even having to leave the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research," Bartlett notes.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online supporters of right-wing groups are all young men, spurred by the growing rate of immigration.
But on the other hand, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic, and less violent than those who remain constantly hidden behind the computer screen."
The work of the DEMOS team is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research teams, health scientists, and political researchers use this site to study everything from health issues to social trends hiding with status updates, wall posts, and the push of the “Like” button.
Facebook reports more than 800 million active users. Each of them, on average, provides three different data per day, which makes this social network literally "information supernova", which is behind the development of many new research. The number of academic works, in the name of which there is a word Facebook, has increased to an estimated 800%.
For some scientists, the magic of Facebook is that it gives them the ability to study people without having to bother them somewhere on the street.
"It used to be that when you wanted to conduct a survey among people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You'd have to get to the side where they'd never let you go," Bartlett says.
"All of this is knocking down Facebook - you just go straight to them."
Others argue that the site can offer a way to identify a social-health problem and avoid it.
In a recent study by Dr. Megan Moren of the University of Wisconsin, the research team found that university students who discussed their drunken outbursts on Facebook were far more at risk for alcoholism than students who remained silent on the subject.
Moren suggests that students’ peers monitor the site and come up with an offer to help a student who posts too many drunk statuses.
"The problem can't be solved if you can't diagnose it," said Dimitri Christakis, a co-author of Dr. Moren and director of the Center for Children's Health, Behavior and Development at the Children's Research Institute in Seattle.
"We have found a way to identify vulnerable children that we would not otherwise have had a chance to discover."
Facebook itself is constantly probing its users’ data.
The site’s information team has compiled statistics on the relationship between relationship statuses and Valentine’s Day, election turnout in 2010 and the nation’s satisfaction ratio (mainly using information they had access to – internet freedom advocates have long argued that the site should have its own information treasure to back up and down).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them, whether they like it or not - in exchange for the opportunity to play Scrabble with a friend who is thousands of miles away, the site needs to provide their personal information.
But what if Facebook users become part of a research they don’t even know about?
Scientists have clearly defined rules about how to collect data offline. However, online data is accessible to everyone.
“I don’t think most users even thought that scientists could look into their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using the public Facebook walls of his students.
"When it came to them, they took it so that the information was only between them and their friends."
It is also important to consider the question of methodology.
Even when researching offline, there is no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to verify how much of the information on the profile and the posts on the wall are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” Selwyn explains.
That’s why Selwin, who has spent years researching new technologies, thinks that pencil and notebook are still the best possible tool that can be used in research.
“When you go into the real world and talk to real people, it’s something that can’t be replaced,” he says.
“Social research should be about society and social activities – and a hell of a lot of social activities are still going on offline.”
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Behring Breivik attends his first public court hearing
Anders Behring Breivik, a man who confessed to conceiving two attacks in which 77 people were killed in Norway this summer, described himself as a “rebellion” fighter during his first public court hearing in Oslo.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian Resistance and among the Norwegian Knights Templar," he told a courtroom where 500 people gathered.
“I object to the court’s decision because the mandate has been given to you by organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.”
"I confess my actions, but I do not confess any guilt for them."
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "didn't want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a stage from which he could express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a prepared speech with him, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to keep Breivika in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from any contact with the media for 4 days, and announced that the authorities would have full control over all his visits and all correspondence for eight weeks.
The hearing was attended by about 30 relatives of the victims and survivors.
Some came in the hope that they would be able to look Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was held firmly under the lock.
All of them took part in order to move the case to early closure.
"It seemed to me that he looked cold and inhuman," one of the survivors of the attack told the NRK commentator.
"It was nothing pleasant, but for myself I can say that after I saw and heard the suspect, I mentally moved a little further."
Breivik, in a dark suit and blue tie, remained calm and professional throughout the hearing. On arrival and departure to the building without difficulty, looking the journalists present and the survivors in the eyes.
Despite Breivik's bizarre notion that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge indicated that he was not insane, and noted that there was no evidence that he had any accomplice.
For some, it may be comforting that the June 22 attacks appear to be the work of a single extremist and not a group of radicals.
However, this does not automatically reduce the sadness and confusion that is still in the minds and hearts of the entire nation.
"I wish she looked like a creature, but she's not," said the relative of one of the victims.
"If it were, it would be much easier."
7 Lessons from a Lost Interview with Steve Jobs in a Movie Heading to the Movies This Week
When Steve Jobs died on October 5, the opinions of people who compared him to Henry Ford began to appear – and elected him for his genius as the Greatest Modern Inventor.
In a recently re-released interview with Jobs, which was dusted for a special movie heading into theaters this week, it will be a fact for all Apple fans that his creative mind perfectly understands the business processes and workflows behind his products.
He was an amazing designer, a dreamer and a self-proclaimed member of the hippie movement, but also a pedantic organizer and a man who fits every detail into the smallest detail - he believed that many entrepreneurs suffer "assuming that a really great idea is 90 percent of their work... [but] it's an excellent one.
In 1995, Bob Cringley worked on the TV show Triumph of Computer Madness, which discussed the dawn of personal computers. During filming, a unique, more than hour-long interview took place.
It had been ten years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he had been working full-time with his new computer company NeXT, and impatiently watching the general public embrace the internet.
In the end, only a short part of the entire Cringley interview was used in the TV show, and the original copies of the interview were said to have been lost in transit.
Shortly after Jobs's death, however, VHS copies were found in the director's garage.
It is this material, slightly cut, that forms the basis of the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: A Lost Interview, which is heading to select cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
To someone who has become famous for his reluctance to provide longer interviews, Jobs seems surprisingly excited to be able to talk about his technological philosophy and business strategies.
He also appears to be a very thoughtful man.
Four times during the interview, there will be a longer pause between the question and the answer - 10 to 15 seconds of thinking, when it is seen how Jobs perfectly thinks the answer to be as accurate and accurate as possible.
There are also moments when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, when he is impatient with Cringley’s questions and drives him to get to more important issues and topics faster.
The interview was filmed before the era of the Pixar, iPod or iPhone, and horribly prophetic ideas pop up in it when Jobs evaluates what other companies are doing right and wrong while offering his own vision of the future in the field of computer technology.
It’s one thing to read the post-mortem reviews of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring about Jobs, whom we see here as a keen dreamer in the bloom of his genius.
He has his own vision of what things can and should look like.
It did not take long, and after he had uttered his thoughts, he began to put them into practice.
A quick summary of seven scenes from the Lost Interview that are definitely worth noting:
How he learned to run a business:
“During the years of business, I’ve always asked myself, ‘Why are you doing this?’ and the answer was always the same: ‘Well, that’s just how it’s done.’
No one knows why they do what they do, they never think deeply about things related to business.
That's what I found out.
Jobs goes on to describe his effort to simplify accounting at Apple.
He was completely confused by the way costs were recorded - often beginning with the inscription "standard costs", about their amount he could only imagine. At that moment he decided to go his own way - he developed an automatic tool that guaranteed that they could determine business costs within a moment.
How he made the rosary for the Pope:
Jobs recalls the “Blue Box” he designed with Steve Wozniak — a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and make free calls anywhere in the world.
A number have been written about the device in the past, but Jobs’ enthusiasm when he describes the Blue Box as a tool of power is literally contagious.
It tells how Wozniak tested the devices using a paid phone and allowed them to connect from one AT&T network to another during the call, while using as many satellites as possible.
"At least half a dozen times we've been around the world like this, so when we shouted something into the pay phone, it came a minute later from the second phone at the door," Jobs laughs.
“We were young, and we found that we could build a thing that is capable of running billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world.”
The two of us made a tiny thing that could control a much larger plant - it was an incredible experience and I think Apple would never have been born without it.
Jobs goes on to describe the joke they almost ended with Wozniak. Through the Blue Box in the middle of the night, they called the Vatican and asked if they could talk to the Pope, making the best of Henry Kissinger.
Gradually, members of the Catholic Church were called up to speak to an American diplomat in the middle of the night, and it was not until just before they had awakened the Pope himself on the phone that the couple squirmed and put down their headphones.
How he fell in love with technology (and phoned Bill Hewlett):
When he was 12 and was looking for spare parts to build his pacemaker, he found Bill Hewlett's number on his phone book and called him.
Not long after their 20-minute interview, Jobs had already secured a summer brigade at Hewlett-Packard.
"It was the only company I knew at the time, and it shaped my view of what a company really is and how it should treat its employees."
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research lab in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
It was as big as a suitcase, had a CRT monitor, and I instantly fell in love with it.
As a teenager, I progressed higher and higher in HP, hung around the computer and started writing programs for it.
How Innovation Invents:
In several places during the interview, Jobs talks about how he invents new products while running.
In the beginning of his career, when he went to sell a couple of PCBs, one customer asked him to put together a whole computer for him.
He had only 30 paid days to invent, assemble and deliver the finished equipment.
When he was later at Apple, he recalled the problems they faced when developing a computer mouse:
“I remember fighting pretty wildly... screaming at me that it would take five years [to build a mouse that would cost $300] to stop having fun, I went out and found a designer.”
Ninety days later, we were able to produce a perfectly reliable mouse for $15.
How big companies breathe:
Long before he led Apple’s resurrection, Jobs prudently predicted that many industry leaders would backtrack on his vision and lose their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers or printers, so what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company can no longer be more successful.
At this point, sales and marketing are already in place, so companies are run by people who are in charge of this, while people who are in charge of their own products are kept out of the decision-making process.
The technological genius that has led the company to its unshakable position is now replaced by people who have no idea of good or bad products – skill and technical knowledge are necessary.
This is exactly what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have owned virtually the entire computer industry.
It could be ten times bigger than it is, it could be a Microsoft of the 1990s...
Instead of winning, they won by losing.
Taking Innovation as a Form of Art:
"Between a great idea and a great product there is still a long way to go and a lot of work to do... and as that great idea develops, it changes and grows."
You will learn a lot about him during that time.
You have to come up with a number of compromises - certain things just electrons, glass, robots or factories do not force you to do.
You have to keep in mind 5,000 things all the time - different concepts - and put them together...
After all, it’s about taste – you try to think about the best things that humanity has ever created, and in some ways you try to project them into what you’re doing yourself.
Picasso said that good artists copy, but the best artists steal.
I was never ashamed to steal the best ideas.
Macintosh was so amazing and successful because the people who worked at it were excellent musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians and, by the way, the best computer experts in the world.
Without computers and new technologies, they would be able to do amazing things in completely different industries.
Scalia and Thomas had dinner with opponents of the Health Care Act at a time when their case was being handled by a court
On the day when the Supreme Court sat behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial issue of whether to accept an objection to President Obama’s health care law, two of his judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, attended a celebratory dinner sponsored by a law firm that will be attended by co-sponsors.
The event took place last Thursday, when all nine judges met to discuss the proposals submitted.
One of the cases under consideration was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging a radical overhaul of health care passed by Congress last year — a law that mobilized conservative activists around the world.
The judges agreed to hear the case, but a 5.5-hour hearing is expected in March, the result of which will further expand the presidential election, which is scheduled for 2012 and will be in full swing at the time of the decision.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and try to get the law rejected will most likely be Paul Clement, who served as Attorney General of the United States under the George W. Bush administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, which has been defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another company that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the business associations challenging the law, the so-called National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc, for which huge funds are at stake.
The dinner was held in a Washington hotel hours after a court hearing on the subject of the case.
It was attended by, among others, Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate and a confirmed opponent of the Health Care Act.
And introducing guests? Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: This pair of judges with the actions of the Federalist Society has been participating for years.
This is not something that goes against the rules of ethics.
In fact, these judges are exempt from the obligation to adhere to the principles of conduct that lower federal judges are subject to.
If this were not the case, however, their conduct would certainly fall under the principle of C4, which states that "the judge may participate in actions that are currently being organized by the related and other organizations for the purpose of obtaining funds, but the judge may not be a speaker, an honorary guest, nor may he be included in the program of the action."
Still, Scalia and Thomas’ relationship with the two law firms acting in the case, as well as companies with a huge financial interest in the case, was rich enough to alert activists calling for ethics in the government.
“This shocking violation of ethics and indifference to the code of conduct is contrary to several judges’ contention that the Supreme Court is acting under the same rules that apply to all other federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Cause organization.
"The judges drank and dined on social benefits together with legal representatives waiting to discuss their case in court."
Their presence and assistance in obtaining funds through this action undermines any claim of indifference, which is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas showed little understanding of their critics and pointed out to them that they were also able to combine their legal obligations with the actions of groups such as the Federalist Society.
Thomas's wife Ginni is a high-profile conservative activist.
In addition, the conservatives argue that the ethical problem is mainly Judge Elena Kagan and not Scalia with Thomas.
Kagan served as Attorney General under President Obama when the first objections to the law appeared before the court.
Critics of Kagan pressured her to give up her involvement in the case, claiming she had fought so hard for the law that she could be unconcerned now.
Kagan had no indication that she was going to resign.
Boeing Receives Record US$18 Billion Power Aircraft Order
Emirates has ordered 50 Boeing 777 twin-engine jets with the option to purchase 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Aman Air, for which it collects more than $1 billion.
When a company gets an order for 50 pieces of their products, it’s usually no reason to celebrate.
However, if that company is a Boeing Co. aircraft manufacturer and the price of these 50 aircraft totals a record $18 billion, it’s something else.
Equally important is where Boeing got its order from: the Middle East, the expanding gold mine for future aircraft orders.
According to a forecast released on Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced its largest order in history over the weekend in terms of dollar value for commercial aircraft — 50 twin-jet Boeing 777s.
The sensational order came from Emirates airlines based in Dubai.
Boeing said at the 2011 Dubai Air Show that airlines have the option to purchase an additional 20 aircraft, bringing the total value of the contract to $26 billion.
On Monday, Boeing announced that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, sometimes referred to as Dreamliners, which boast significantly improved fuel consumption and passenger equipment.
The total cost of these six aircraft exceeds $1 billion.
"This is an excellent report for the entire Boeing company," said Neal Dihora, an analyst for Morningstar.
"The quality of these specific customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East belong to the oil-producing nations there.
That means they have not only money to pay for planes, but an increase in fuel prices — mostly damaging airlines, because it’s one of its biggest costs — isn’t so crucial because the country itself is making money at higher oil prices.
This is important because they are not as likely as other airlines to cancel or delay aircraft orders due to fuel price increases, Dihora says.
"They have such natural protection," he says.
The order from Emirates consolidates Boeaing’s leading position in the wide-body aircraft market and brings Airbus SAS into a tight circle, which sought to disrupt Boeing’s dominance with its A350 transport model.
Boeing’s victory comes four months after Airbus representatives announced that the first flight of their largest A350 aircraft, which is a direct competitor to the 777-300ER, would be delayed.
The postponement occurred because customers demanded more payload of the aircraft and the flight, so the manufacturer took the time to be able to supply the machine with more engine power.
Boeing Co's share price rose 1.5% to $67.94.
Mexican President's Sister Defeated in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n Election
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that her opponent, Faust Vallejon of the PRI, was aided in the pursuit of the governor's chair by drug dealers.
Sister Felipe Calderon appears to have lost her governorship in the violent state election in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, and on Monday she announced that drug dealers had helped one of her opponents win.
The preliminary results were attributed to the leadership in the Western state's presidential election to Faust Vallej of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The actions of members of organized crime in the entire electoral process and especially in the course of yesterday's elections are alarming not only for Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, but for the whole of our country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview the day after Sunday's elections.
"They threatened our candidates, members of the public opinion research group... they entertained ballot boxes, they built roadblocks... and they let people vote to order for the PRI.
The PRI party ruled in Mexico for seven decades until 2000, when it lost the presidency.
However, he plans to return to power soon, and victory in the elections in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n is an important step in this effort.
The PRI party hopes to win the presidential election in July.
It seems that Vallejo defeated Calderon, who led the day before the election, only very closely.
Calderon, a candidate for her brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
The third was Silvano Aureolis, a candidate for the left-wing Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, which has so far dominated the governor's office. For a disputable and misguided persecuted party, before the 2012 presidential election, it was a very unfortunate loss.
Aureoles also refused to accept the provisional findings as valid.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital Morelia, rejects any dealings with drug dealers and calls on other candidates to recognize the results.
Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n has long been controlled by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine.
It is the birthplace of President Calderon and it was in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n in December 2006 that he launched a military fight against the smugglers.
However, the violence persisted.
The PAN mayor, a supporter of Luisa Marie Calderon, was assassinated just a week before the election and many candidates resigned out of fear.
However, regardless of how the results of the election in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n look for the PRI party, the victory of the party will help to gain a new impetus.
The PRI’s expected representative in the presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, from Washington congratulated Valley and said, “I think this victory could be very encouraging given the coming year.”
ADB calls on Asia to help save the Eurozone
The Asian Development Bank has urged India and China to be prepared to help rescue the eurozone from its severe debt crisis, otherwise there could be a global downturn that would have a negative impact on growth in Asia as well.
Rajat Nag, CEO of Manila-based ADB, said the world’s two fastest-growing economies must “do everything in their power” to help the currency bloc recover quickly through the International Monetary Fund, or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that the countries of the Bric group [Brazil, Russia, India, China] are watching all of Europe’s troubles “too unsettled” and said that Asian financial aid, combined with European leadership and resources, will help to fuel the long-term collapse of the global economy.
"We're all in this together."
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is right," he told the Financial Times during an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some extent, but it's definitely not immune."
"So if China and India can help, they should definitely do it."
For several months now, the European Monetary Association has been severely tested by a serious debt crisis.
In recent days, Italy’s borrowing costs have risen dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
Europe’s growing debt crisis has raised concerns that it could pull the global economy back into recession, and calls have started to emerge for emerging frontline economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that all Asian support would be channelled through the IMF, but noted that bilateral aid - such as the purchase of bonds from the European Union Financial Assistance Fund, the European Financial Stability Facility - would provide Asian partners in European countries with greater negotiating opportunities.
Anand Sharma, India’s trade minister, said that “India will do what it can” to help the eurozone because its own economy is now suffering from a drop in exports and a drain on foreign capital inflows.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and restless," he said.
"We are facing a difficult task and we need to maintain a high rate of growth."
"It's not an alternative, it's a bare fact, because otherwise we could find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies, such as the Indian one, have nothing to help European economies when they are forced to face their own serious economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be politically very difficult to explain the aid to Europe to India’s 1.2 billion people when 800 million of them live on $2 or less a day.
"One day they might find out that the Greeks are retiring at fifty and enjoying their holidays on the beaches, which would probably be difficult for them to explain," he said.
Lee Howell, director-general of the World Economic Forum, similarly questioned why Indian stocks should be used to maintain the well-paid employment of many Greek citizens in badly managed and loss-making sectors such as rail transport.
Mr Nag stressed that the eurozone crisis is at risk of a "dangerous domino effect".
The bank’s forecast of 7.5% economic growth in Asia between 2011/2012 now faces a “risk of decline” due to the European threat.
He said vulnerable emerging markets must create “plans of unpredictable spending” to protect them from a decline and a significant outflow of capital from their economies.
Pentagon Warns of Possible Defensive Cuts
U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta on Monday slammed under the boiler, warning that looming automatic budget cuts could threaten national security and trigger a financial chain reaction starting in the Pentagon and continuing across the battlefields of Afghanistan to civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon will have to spend a $450 billion budget cut over the next decade, but is now worried about another $600 billion if Congress fails to reach an spending agreement.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the entire resort," Panetta wrote in a letter to Senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said the inability of Congress to reach a budget agreement and the resulting so-called obstruction will cause a 23% flattening and halting of many new projects.
"Due to such a huge reduction, used in this reckless way, it will not be possible to carry out most of our construction or ship projects - you can't buy just three-quarters of buildings or ships. In addition, there could be serious damage to further modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to senators.
"We will also be forced to segregate many of our civilian employees, and as the reduction is expected to run so fast, we will also almost certainly have to send civilians on forced leave to be able to meet the target requirements."
"These changes can shake the faith of those who care about our army and seriously damage its readiness."
In the end, the cuts will also affect the combat units, Panetta announced.
"Although the accounts for the financing of possible war operations overseas will not be directly affected by this stoppage, the operations there will be adversely affected by serious changes in other budgets," Panetta warned.
"There will also be cuts in contract staff, which will result in delays in the agreed contracts supporting the war effort of our people."
"The state of paid employees will be reduced, which will also result in delayed payments to suppliers and subsequent violations of legal and political support."
Both senators wrote Panett off ten days ago and asked him for details on the possible impact on automatic cuts at the Department of Defense.
"The consequences of a standstill at the Department of Defense could cause rapid degradation of the view of the United States as a world military power."
"We are strictly against this harsh measure," the senators announced in a joint statement Monday afternoon when they published Panett's letter.
"It's not a conclusion we can live with, and we definitely don't want to sign it."
"The planned cuts are a threat to the national security of the United States, which we should not allow."
“It will only be seen whether Panett’s letter and fresh warnings will increase pressure on Congress to approve the budget and increase votes calling for the Pentagon to be left out of the list of restricted areas.
Panetta has been increasingly open in recent talks about possible cuts, even though he himself has moved on to his senior position in the Pentagon with years of experience approving budgets in Congress and the White House, so he knew he was going into a tough fight.
At a press conference held last minute, the defense minister indicated a brief picture of what his ministry can expect - an army shell, but inside which the core will be missing.
"It'll be like a ship without sailors."
"He'll be like a brigade without ammunition."
"It'll be like an air force without trained pilots."
"It will be like a paper tiger, like an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to complete the mission," Panetta said at the start of a Pentagon speech.
"It will be like a unit without morality, unprepared and unable to deal with a possible enemy."
"As a result, he will welcome aggression..."
The annex, delivered in a letter to McCain and Graham Panetta, specifies how the reduction will result in "significant operational risks: late response to crises, conflicts and disasters; significant limitations on the possibility of landings and deployments around the world; anticipated unacceptable risks in future operations."
In addition, Panetta added that some of the biggest defense projects could await completion, including those that are already being tested, as well as those that are only in the early stages of planning.
The list included, for example, a project of an F35 aircraft, a planned new bomber, a new generation of ballistic submarines, a new coastal battleship and a new ground combat vehicle, which the army and marines wanted to replace the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 would save $80 billion over the next ten years, but its proponents argue that this is a necessary next step in improving the military, which is needed for the country to deal with possible threats from China and other rivals.
How to recognize a lie
A cursory look at recent newspaper headlines tells us how serious and ubiquitous lies and deceptions are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain has a full-on job accusing him of sexually harassing several women — both sides claiming the other is lying.
Administrators at Penn State University were accused of falsifying testimony when they tried to hide records of a retired football coach sexually assaulting a boy.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught holding a microphone that said to U.S. President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lie was able to destroy entire careers and obscure the stability of many countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself when he published information that was immediately refuted by unquestionable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of using the money from his campaign to try to cover up his estranged relationship.
And no one will ever forget the media circus that collapsed around Bill Clinton when he lied during his second term in office about his sexual involvement with Monica Lewinska.
It’s all about cheating at school and at university.
There are times when teachers themselves give their students test answers just to make themselves look good in their assessments.
Mentors, who should teach the opposite, send a message that lying and cheating is acceptable.
How many scams do we encounter?
Studies show that in a single day you will live anywhere between 10 and 200 cases.
Let us assume that many of them are merciful lies.
Another study found that strangers lied three times during the first ten minutes of their first meeting.
Determining lies, or "recognizing lies", is a necessary skill that everyone should acquire, whether for personal or work reasons.
However, it is not a social game that would be similar, say, to Charade, when one shouts, "I have you." Deception is a serious branch of science working with scientific data collected over the past six decades at prestigious universities in the course of detailed research projects, in the field of psychology, and in the field of philosophy.
One of the results of the research is that most of the old myths about lies have been refuted.
Liars look you in the eye.
It's not like they're jerking off, flirting, redheading or squeezing.
However, do not assume that it is somehow difficult to spot and expose liars.
A trained lie identifier can reveal the truth from a sentence structure, small facial expressions, the way questions are created and their timing.
I have spent several years gathering scientific knowledge from a vast and developing industry relating to lie detection, and it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that can be easily learned and in today's complex world can be of great help to you - especially if you are in the middle of your work.
Good liars can read well in others, let them be watered in caution, direct their emotions, and intuitively realize how the other party accepts them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more often than introverts, that men tell more “self-centered” lies, while women tell more lies “focused on others” — mostly to protect someone’s feelings — that married people lie less often to their partners than free people (but most of them do lie).
We also know that if you are perceived as a sinner, others feel less guilty when they lie to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of the subject.
This is called "initial observation".
This will give him a better understanding of what to compare it with.
Notice the holding of the subject's body, his laughter, working with his voice.
You should know if someone is habitually knocking on their feet so that you don’t wrongly accuse them of lying just because they start knocking on their feet in the middle of a meeting.
Then try to determine the clusters of false verbal and nonverbal behavior.
But take it only as warning signs, not as proof of a lie.
People who tell lies can stop moving the upper half of their body when they try to remember their fictional story, they can turn the tips of the shoes to the door, lean to the east, significantly change the posture of the body or reveal the "crazy after the conversation" - the excess of the relief of change is a half-step away.
Interviewers often give a false signal that the interview is over, only to see what relief will look like after it ends.
Notice the subject’s language as well.
Scott Peterson's famous story of how he once disavowed and used the past tense when he claimed that his murdered wife was alive, sparking a nationwide search for her body.
Deceptive individuals may also express themselves moderately: "I had no sexual relations with that lady... Miss Lewinska" or repeat the difficult question altogether.
The most common verbal signs are only very minor.
Someone can use a lot of "softening language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... from what I know... to my best conscience."
In such an answer, we will not learn too many facts and often it is another warning signal.
There is no magic to reveal every lie, but it is possible to acquire the skills by which the lie can be debunked.
With the help of these skills, a person will have a better chance of encountering a liar and a fraudster in his personal and professional life.
The controversial plan to build an oil pipeline will be rerouted after the threat of a delay in approval by the U.S. government emerged
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to postpone approval of the planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico - thus pitting the unions against each other, but calming down the environmentalists - the pipeline-building company announced that it was willing to redirect the project so as to do so.
TransCanada announced on Monday evening that it will move its planned pipeline route from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills area of Nebraska, and is confident that the project will be approved.
The company announced this decision at a press conference at the headquarters of the Government of Nebraska.
TransCanada contractor Alex Pourbax says the company is confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, even though it will lead a different route.
The announcement came after the State Department announced last week that it was delaying a decision on a federal permit for the project, from where it would not conduct a study of possible replacement routes that would allow it not to interfere with the Sandhills area of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground backwater.
"This is really moving forward," Republican Rep. Lee Terry of Nebraska told Fox News.
The new environmental assessment ordered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would probably postpone any decision until 2013, a year after the elections next year, but the authorities refuse to play any role in the decision.
In a written statement last week, Obama described the decision as a foreign ministry request and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700-mile pipeline will connect Canada and the Gulf of Mexico.
From the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas, it runs 700,000 barrels of oil a day.
Six states will have to cross this road.
This project is absolutely hated by environmentalists, but it is loved by work groups who estimate that 20,000 new jobs will appear while working on the pipeline.
Nebraska lawmakers, however, opposed the plan and considered introducing laws that would force the company not to interfere with the Sand Hills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the main source of drinking water and irrigation.
An existing environmental impact study commissioned by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs found that the project would only have a minor negative environmental impact, but an energy industry source said the Ministry’s inspector general ordered a new review of the entire process of the original study, focusing mainly on two issues.
Once, it was whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was Hillary Clinton’s adviser in 2008, represented a conflict of interest in the program.
Further, whether the company that was hired to conduct the original study was not chosen inappropriately because it had ties to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle is accused of causing her baby to vomit.
The New York family alleges that singer Patti LaBelle stormed into the lobby of their Manhattan home and frightened their daughter so much that she threw herself out of fear.
The performance of the singer of the hit "Lady Marmalade" scared eighteen-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorder" and "increased fear of strangers," her family says in a lawsuit filed with the Manhattan Supreme Court.
On November 10, last year, stage technician Kevin Monk, his wife Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing for a family trip.
When Kevin Monk docked the car, Roseanna Monk packed her bags down to the lobby of their home on Riverside Boulevard and carried Genevieve with her.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped at the door for a moment and put the baby away for a moment.
"Someone showed up behind my back and said, 'You know what your daughter's doing?' I said 'yes' and left to pick her up."
LaBelle chastised the pregnant woman with irritation.
"She said to me in an aggressive tone, 'You shouldn't put your daughter at the door,'" said Roseanna Monk.
"I told her, 'I don't care about your opinion.' "
She became angry and began to speak in a low voice, shouting out the simplest expressions...
She had a bottle of water with her, and she began to pour water on me.
He claims Genevieve had a hysterical seizure.
"I said to the woman, 'Look what you've done to my daughter,'" the child's mother said.
LaBelle threw herself at her mother, who was still holding Genevieve, and had to stop her until her escort pulled her into the waiting car, Roseanna Monk said.
The girl was screaming so much that she threw herself up, she added.
Later, the family sent a letter demanding an apology from LaBelle, but no response was received.
LaBelle's lawyer and spokesperson do not respond to our phone calls to comment on the entire case.
The lawsuit calls for closer unspecified damages, but family lawyer Sam Davis said he took the case free of charge and that the family plans to donate all the money to a charity dedicated to children with cancer.
"The goal is to force Patti LaBelle to accept responsibility for her actions," Davis said.
"Such behavior is completely unacceptable, especially if it is directed against a school teacher holding an eighteen-month-old child in her arms."
Climate change has crippled the economy
During the first year of the government of Maria L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, unemployment and unreliability increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment decreased and with them the economy
The year 2011 will be recorded in the economic history of Sinaloa. This is the first year of the government of Maria L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdez, which calls itself the government of change. This government has brought with it great expectations in terms of economic progress, however, due to adverse climatic conditions and the lack of conditions to begin with.
Low February temperatures caused millions of losses in the field of agriculture, limited the possibilities of growth of the state economy, they are aware of the decrease in economic activity by 3.6% in the first half of this year. In the field of agriculture there was a historic decrease of 31.16%, which disturbed the dynamics of other sectors.
According to the report on the damage caused, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, the damage was recorded on 582,835 hectares of cultivated land, of which 78,03% was completely destroyed and the remaining 21,07% was found partial damage.
The decline in economic activity up to November caused a steady increase in unemployment in the state. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Geography, the unemployment rate in the state increased by 68%, the unemployment rate increased by 9%, and the unemployment rate in the state increased by 9%. From January to March, the unemployment rate was 55,053 people in the state of Sinaloa, which does not account for the unemployment rate.
Less liquidity
According to Gerard L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes, director of the UAS Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences, it is possible to explain the increase in unemployment indirectly, based on the steps taken at the level of public policy.
"We are witnessing rising unemployment, which is related to various factors. Among them are, among other things, the loss of liquidity in the market due to resource constraints as a result of legislation passed by Congress in the context of the fight against money laundering. For people who have illegally seized them, do not force them to do so,"
Stopping the migration
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Cervantes said that a demographic factor is also involved in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who go to work abroad, to the United States, has decreased, both because of the difficult entry and also because even if these people get over the border, it is difficult for them to get a job. So people stay and demand work from our state, and so unemployment. "
Unreliability
The analysis of the labor market in Sinaloa is also deteriorating due to the growing unreliability that prevails in the field of working conditions. According to the National Institute for Statistics and Democracy, 60.38% of the employed population in the state works without paying benefits to the administration of social security.
Other features of the labor market, such as low wages, are added to unemployment and unreliability. In this administrative area, the lowest wages are from all over the country, according to the registers of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Planning.
The average monthly income of workers in the state of Sinaloa was 5,352 pesetas until September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesetas.
Reduction of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
Along with the decline in economic activity and the rise in unemployment, the most significant decline in foreign direct investment in the last 10 years was also recorded in 2011. According to the Ministry of Finance, foreign direct investment in the period from January to June reached an amount of $630,697, which represents a decrease of 3 percent from the previous year to 87.74%.
On the other hand, the Ministry of Economic Development of the state government announces investments in the amount of 17,280 million pesetas per year. These investments were directed primarily to enterprises in the field of services.
Dluh
In the context of the economic downturn scenario, the government of this state asked the State Congress in July for a no peso loan of 3 billion pesos. This would be intended for investment in infrastructure projects in 18 urban areas in order to revive the economy. The local Congress did not approve the state loan of 2 million pesos.
Responsiveness
According to the representatives of the business sector, the first year of the government, Maria L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Valdés, pointed to the lack of management skills of the government.
Miguel Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was a lack of alignment of the will of individual sectors, including the state government itself.
"The development of the economy in Sinaloa was really small during this year. We have to work intensively to get back the land that we lost this year. In 2012 we have to double the effort, there has been a lack of harmonisation of the efforts of all of us and especially the correct and synchronized functioning of this new government, we will do better.
Slowing down the economy
Loredo L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said that events such as the frost at the beginning of the year stopped the state economy and limited its development and growth.
"The weak economic movement was caused by a number of events, including frosts. One of the main consequences was the slowdown of the economy, which did not recover quickly enough to be able to re-establish the dynamism that would allow us to achieve an acceptable level of movement of processes, products and services", he concluded.
Redefining the mission
According to Teodor Salazar Uriarte, president of the Employers’ Confederation of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, the state needs to be pushed towards more dynamic productive activities.
"Generally speaking, we are observing that it is working. We believe that a long-term plan needs to be prepared in which the goals and economic direction of the state are redefined, because it is important to mobilize all the potential of material and human resources that Sinaloa has," he said.
The work ahead of us
President Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better guide the government’s efforts.
“In general, I would say that the government has been trying to achieve good results in various areas, some progress has been made in the area of economic development, but it is important to create a long-term plan,” he said.
He said that the current administration has shown progress in terms of public policy management.
"There are elements that make it possible to claim that the government is trying to be welcoming. I can say that there is work being done here and I think the government is aware that there is also a lot of work ahead of us," he said.
Convicted of 8 kg of marijuana
Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in prison for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Attorney General's Office of the Republic informed that the convicted dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval. He was convicted for the crime of endangering health, specifically for possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by Mexican Army units on 7 June 2010 while walking in Cipriano Valdez Street, opposite Station 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The dealer was driving in a white pick-up van. He had a black bag in the car on the shelf and a small backpack in the passenger seat. The soldiers found 8 kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the secured man remained at the disposal of the Judges of the Second Division and the proceedings remain internal within the Centre for the Implementation of the Legal Impacts of Criminal Offences.
He owes contributions to projects.
Social projects, which are part of programs such as Habitat, Saving Public Places and 3x1 for Migrants, face the danger that they will not be reached to the end or that they will have a great delay due to lack of economic resources, said Miguel <0xC3><0x81>ngel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Miranda.
The Director of Urban Social Development said that while construction work has progressed so far, there is now a threat that the state government will not be able to provide the relevant supplies that require funds of more than 11 million pesos for three programmes.
He said that the total investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos. The state accounts for 25%. Until now, only the Federation and the city have provided funds for work, therefore, it is possible that there will be a delay in the implementation of projects.
"They are supposed to provide almost 12 million and although the year is already drawing to a close, we have not received anything at all. And despite the fact that we should have received part of it in July," he said. "In order not to waste time, we have started projects and continue very successfully, but we lack money".
He said that last year, under the administration of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Aguilar Padilla, the state did not meet the relevant supplies, and therefore, at the beginning of the new period, the city had to apply for a loan to be able to pay more than 7 million, which was not given to them by the state administration.
"The same thing happened to us already in the previous six-year period, because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs went on. To get to the aforementioned programs this year, we had to get funds that would cover what the state did not finish," he explained.
Despite the fact that there is a promise on the part of the state officials regarding the transfer of these resources, he said that a request was sent to Armand Villarreal, the Secretary of Administration and Finance, to expedite the proceedings and the corresponding percentage arrived as soon as possible.
“They were supposed to give us 12 million and although the year is coming to an end, we haven’t even gotten a peso yet.”
Court Approves ‘End of Analog Broadcast’ in Mexico in 2015
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme State Court (SCJN) rejected the constitutional lawsuit filed by the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies against the presidential decree, which wants to hasten the so-called "disconnection of analog signals" and implement it in 2015 instead of 2021.
A minority of four ministers, including the head of the court, Juan Silva Meza, believed that President Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n did not exceed his powers when he issued a decree detailing individual steps that would lead to the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With this result, the action brought by the Senate was rejected, because a qualified majority of eight votes was not reached, which is necessary for the court to be able to express itself on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the said decree, which thus remains valid.
The draft judgment drafted by Minister Olga S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero presents the possibility of declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of all matters relating to radio and television is a matter that is reserved by law to the Federal Commission for Telecommunications (Cofetel). Thus, there is a violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and expropriation.
Only Zald<0xC3><0xAD>var, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero voted for the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies supported the constitutional dispute in an attempt to combat the decree. Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero accepted the requirements and suspended the application of the decree and all the actions described therein, leading to the transition to digitalization.
The meeting of ministers also decided to reject the action brought by the Chamber of Deputies without entering into a discussion on the proposal, which is also the responsibility of Minister S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that he does not identify with the arguments of the proposal in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general standards measures to prepare public administration.
"I don't think that even if she did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulator," he said, adding that public policy planning in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector belongs to the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate to determine the direction of the state.
Replacing analog signals with digital signals is one of the biggest changes the world has experienced in recent years. It is related to better use of radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
He believes that delaying the change would mean delaying the benefits of digitisation, which requires a decision on a matter of public interest. Digitalisation not only has a technical dimension, but "it also touches on economic, social, political and national security issues".
As he stressed, these issues "require the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of the economic direction of the state. It includes a number of competences that the Constitution entrusts to the government of the state".
He recalled that a number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to the digital system and have done so through their governments, even though they had highly specialized technical bodies at their disposal.
He said that it is not possible for the government to introduce into the administration compliance with laws prepared by legislative powers by issuing a discordant decree, which to a certain extent interferes with the powers of the Congress.
In Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n they analyze the possibility of adding "voice by voice"
According to data published by the PREP, the difference between first and second place in the governor's election is less than 27 percent. So far, 879 votes out of 6074 constituencies have not been counted.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" appeared in this year's elections in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n, where, according to data published by the Preliminary Election Results Program (PREP), the difference between first and second place in the governor's elections is less than 27 percent, and this has not yet been counted out of the total votes of 8 votes.
In this context, the President of the General Council of the Electoral Institute in Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n (IEM), Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electoral authority approved a number of measures that should harmonise local standards with federal electoral reform.
As will be recalled, Michoac<0xC3><0xA1>n did not officially confirm his political constitution or his State Electoral Code or the Law on Electoral Justice. In fact, the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force had expired in this electoral period, and the Governor of the Republic of Leon held them in office.
On 9 November, the Supreme State Court (SCJN) resolved a constitutional dispute initiated by the local legislature and declared the head of state's vote on constitutional reforms to be "invalid and illegal" because he had no right to "approve or veto them".
On the question of the possibility of a "vote-by-vote" vote, Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a de los <0xC3><0x81>ngeles Llanderal replied that, thanks to the approval of the relevant measures by the General Council of the EMI, it will be possible for the local electoral body to carry out both a partial and an overall vote.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, one or more electoral packages, will be possible under the following conditions: the election results do not agree; there is no record of the counting of votes and the calculation in the relevant box or the president does not have it available; or if the election results are incorrect and obvious.
In addition, a total recount of votes in all polling stations will be possible if there is an indication to the contrary that the difference between the potential winner of the election and the candidate in the second place is less than or equal to one percentage point; whenever at the beginning of the session, an explicit request for a proxy will appear.
A total recount of votes may also be made if, after proper enumeration, it is found that the difference between the probable winner and the candidate in the second place is equal to or less than one percentage point, and also whenever there is an explicit request of the political party whose candidate will be elected in the second place.
It should be mentioned that in such a situation there is an election in Morelia, where, according to the PREP, the difference between the first and second places is less than 0.16%, although 129 of the total 923 electoral districts have not yet been counted.
His Last Will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountains, the family confirmed.
The remains of pilot Felipe Baci<0xC3><0xB3> Cortés were transported on Sunday night to Saltillo, his hometown. During Monday there will be a ceremonial ceremony and a behind-the-scenes mass.
According to the family, the lieutenant colonel's last wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains.
After receiving the highest honors along with the other people who died in the accident, the Baci<0xC3><0xB3> Cortés family returned to the capital Coahuila on board a Mexican Air Force aircraft. The family and closest friends attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon, the colonel's ashes arrived at the chapel located in the Nazario Ortiz Garza class, where family and friends also came.
At 5:30 p.m., a farewell ceremony was held at the Saltillo Institute of Technology, organized by his former high school classmates and members of the American football team, of which Felipe Baci<0xC3><0xB3> was also a member at the time of graduation.
"He wanted to go back to Saltilla and his wish was for his ashes to be scattered in the Zapalinamé Mountains. That's what he always said to his family and friends," said Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
According to her, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all his wishes, was at the top of his life, "he was a wonderful man, an extraordinary father, a son, a loving brother living for his family."
Felipe Baci<0xC3><0xB3> Cortés left Saltillo at a very young age and entered the Colegio del Aire aviation school in Zapop<0xC3><0xA1>n, Jalisco.
Some didn’t believe it because they said he was even driving a truck, but he always followed his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto D<0xC3><0xA1>vila Bacio remembers him as a very good man, "the crowd came to Saltillo, the whole family wanted to see him, as when he brought Martha Sahag<0xC3><0xBA>n to Saltillo".
The young man even remembers that when he was seven years old, he went to Zapopan to promote his uncle, so he is convinced that he died while doing what he loved most in life: flying the plane.
They said their last goodbye.
With Felipe Baci<0xC3><0xB3> Cortés, lieutenant colonel of the Mexican Air Force, we said goodbye to the student with all the honors that came to him from Governor Jorge Torres L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, the citizens and the government of the state, the Mexican army through the sixth military zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, and the head of the school.
Baci<0xC3><0xB3> Cortés died in the past few days after the helicopter he was driving fell. On board was also the Secretary of the Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six other people, all officials of this state.
At 18:05, the remains of the Saltilla native Bacio Cortés (burnt) arrived to be handed over to the Mexican Air Force through the funeral service under the leadership of Major Jaime Martinez to the area where the family, his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, mother, siblings and other students had gathered.
Three Abandoned Dead Body Found on Cadereyta NL
A few hours before the discovery, military officials presented to the media 11 people who were detained in the area for crimes related to organized crime.
The bodies of three men killed by shooting in different parts of the body and head were found on an abandoned farm in the village of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The discovery was made on a 1.5-kilometer road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the level of the area known as El Castillo.
People who moved in these places noticed that the cottage with a beige-coffee fence had an open door from time to time.
When they looked inside, from a distance of about three meters, they noticed the body of three people, so they immediately alerted the competent authorities.
One of the people was wearing a yellow sports shirt and dark cotton pants and was not wearing shoes. Next to him was a person also lying in a sports shirt with white stripes.
A few meters away was the body of another person dressed in a red sports shirt and blue cotton pants.
All three of them lay face down towards the ground.
According to data obtained at the scene, all three people were probably murdered at another location because no bullets were found.
On the fence of the huts were found messages addressed to one group of organized crime the second and also a number of bullet tracks, both on the building and on the door.
Eleven suspects have been arrested in Cadereyta
The Secretaries of National Defense presented 11 people, including youth, who were members of a criminal group that operated mainly in the Cadereyta area and which is associated with kidnapping, murder, persecution and illegal burial.
According to published information, during the first attempt on 11 November in the colony of Los Alveros, 8 people were arrested and one person was able to be released.
Three properties and a mobile phone were secured, confirming that they were members of a criminal group called "Los Zetas".
On November 12, at 6 a.m., the military personnel were at a shopping mall in the Rancho Viejo area of Cadereyta, noticing the cars without SPZ and two people in them.
After stopping the car, they carried out a search and discovered one rifle, a bullet and 18 bullets.
Then, on the basis of these statements, one of the accomplices in the area of La Fraud was arrested on November 13 at about 14:00. When he saw the soldiers, he tried to flee.
They were accused of illegal burials in the municipalities of General Teran, China and Cadereyta.
A new Italian government will be appointed on Wednesday.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet with the Italian president tomorrow to introduce him to a new government that will face the crisis that is holding this country above the abyss of economic disaster.
Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti will meet tomorrow with the Italian president to introduce him to a new government that will face a crisis that is holding this country above the abyss of an economic catastrophe and that has put the entire eurozone in danger.
The presidential palace issued a report in which it announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
He is expected to represent a government composed mostly of technocrats, although it is not yet clear when the new government will take power.
Monti said he would present the president with the results of his talks with political parties in an effort to form a government.
"I want to confirm that I have absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say that he would be able to form a government, but the tone of his comments suggested that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well marked," he added.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, that is, in a much shorter time than usual. Meanwhile, Italy is trying to fight against the political and financial crisis, due to which the amount of debt has climbed to an unsustainable level.
A new administration led by former European Commissioner Montim must approve a tough package of austerity measures required by European leaders, only to restore Italy's shattered credibility.
Due to the volatility of the markets, interest rates on Italian BTP bonds with a 10-year maturity limit of 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to apply for bailout, are under pressure to accelerate.
Emma Marcegaglia, president of the Italian employers’ organisation Confindustria, told reporters after a meeting with Monti: “We said we would be very supportive of this government.”
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this burning situation.
Monti’s hopes of success were greatly increased thanks to the support of PDL’s Silvia Berlusconi, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are destined for good results," Angelina Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant, as up to now a number of its members have stood against the government with the technocratic majority that Monti is putting together.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong support from parliament in order to push for unpopular austerity reforms.
Any impediment or delay in the effort could trigger a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks has added to the pressure, warning that Monti’s failure could spell disaster.
Monti began talks on Monday with political parties, trade unions and business groups, youth and women’s organisations.
The round of talks will end on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by President Napolitano, which allowed for very rapid action in response to the crisis.
After a short fall at the end of last week, when it was already clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian bond yields returned to a critical level, reacting to uncertainty over whether the new prime minister would reap success.
To save Italy, whose public debt is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.8 trillion, would be beyond the scope of the eurozone’s current financial reserves.
Monti said his government should stay in power until the next elections, which are scheduled for 2013, despite general forecasts that politicians will give him time only to carry out reforms, and then announce early elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that this government must consist only of experts to bring Italy out of the hardships the country has gotten into due to financial pressure.
Political sources said that mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties complicate the attempt to include both political figures in the government.
Spaniards participate in international matches more often than Costa Ricans
Out of 22 Spanish footballers, ten will cross the 50-game international boundary.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 called players reached the number of 50 matches.
A huge contrast on the Costa Rican side, if we compare 22 players from both countries who met today at a friendly match at 15:05 at the National Stadium in San José.
While the world and European champions, FIFA’s number one monthly ranking, have on their account a wide range of A-class mid-selection matches, Costa Rica has only defender Michael Uman, who has played 50 international matches as the only one.
This number was reached last Friday in the match against Panama (0-2) at the stadium Rommel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez.
Spanish footballers, who play in the Match of the Stars and in the powerful clubs of the English First League, maintain an intense activity for over a year at league championships and domestic cups and high-level matches within the European Cups such as the Champions League.
To the previous one, we must also add the experience of the Spanish national team in complicated elimination matches for the European and world championships.
Costa Rican players, on the other hand, have very limited opportunities for foreign matches in the area. There is, for example, Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We can see that the largest number of foreign matches from the Spanish national team has in his account goalkeeper <0xC3><0x8D>ker Casillas, who last Saturday before England (loss 0-1 in London) reached the former goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarret with 126 international matches.
Casillas will take on Costa Rica today and win a new record for Spain - 127 international matches.
Xavi Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, Barcelona’s key player, has 106 appearances on his account.
Casillas and Xavi were even officially declared UEFA last week along with other Spanish players who have 100 matches in their account. Among them already mentioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the middle striker Schalke, Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, with 102.
Carles Puyol came close to 100 with 97 matches.
Xabi Alonso followed with 91; Fernando Torres with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta with 62; Cesc F<0xC3><0xA1>bregas with 61; and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rica side and close to Michael Uman move left wing Junior D<0xC3><0xAD>az with 48 games and goalkeeper Bryan Ruiz with 45.
Furthermore, only 5 crossed the 30-game boundary: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez with 36 and José Luis L<0xC3><0xB3>pez with 35.
The smallest number of matches.
With less than 30 matches in Spain, they include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Arbeloa (31) and Ra<0xC3><0xBA>l Albiol (31).
On the national side with less than 30 games, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest did not exceed 20.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one and <0xC3><0x93>lman Vargas and Edder Nelson are still waiting for their first game.
Spain's top scorer is David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
On the Costa Rican side, Bryan Ruiz has the most hits, nine, two more than Carlos Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
The quintet included the country in its tour on the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence
"The road to Costa Rica is a dream that becomes a reality"
In an exclusive interview for Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to offer one of the best concerts at the National Stadium next Sunday.
We have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the group itself assures that for them the opportunity to play in Costa Rica is a dream come true.
So said bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva last week from Brazil.
The group is on tour in South America on the occasion of the celebration of twenty years of existence and on Sunday the 20th will be on a unique stop in Central America.
This day will perform at 19:30 at the National Stadium together with the angel group The X and the national musicians from Las Robertas.
This is a sample interview, the full transcript of which can be found on La Naci<0xC3><0xB3>n's website.
For your Costa Rican fans, it is a dream come true. Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica. Do you realize what your fans are experiencing?
The journey to Costa Rica is also our dream, which becomes a reality.
In South and Central America we are barely the second time and the experience so far has been great.
I have only been to Costa Rica once, on vacation. It is a beautiful country and I believe that we will be able to stay here for a few days.
So we are very happy to be able to bring you our music.
I ask, because they literally adore the band here, the fans are experiencing these days of preparation very intensely.
What do you say to your biggest fans?
Thank you for staying with us for so many years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting so long and we are sorry that it took us so long.
Some people already talk about the concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does it put more pressure on you?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve done in the last 21 years have been over the course of a few weeks.
We performed some great shows in Sao Paulo and we hope to get in shape for a concert in Costa Rica.
We are really looking forward to this concert.
We love this country, we love surfing, we love the jungle. For both activities, Costa Rica is the best country in the world.
How did you get to know Costa Rica and its waves suitable for surfing?
We have a lot of surfer friends and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo. The waves here are incredible.
My friends go surfing in Costa Rica or Nicaragua or Mexico. These are the best places to surf. So we learned about Costa Rica through people who love surfing.
If we look at your tour, you have prepared a huge show with many songs.
What did you plan for your presentation in Costa Rica?
Since we've never played here, we have no restrictions that we couldn't do.
We will try to present the best possible show with a variety of songs. We will try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with a good and varied repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
Why? !
I think it’s partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes other songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs we’ll play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we haven’t played for a long time, we focus on them and we are also surprised because we remember why we liked them so much and that we may have forgotten about it.
So the show is more interesting for us, and that's why I think it's more interesting for people.
This tour celebrates 20 years of artistic trajectory.
When you look back, is it hard to believe everything you’ve done?
Yeah, that's for sure.
First of all, I don't think any of us could have imagined that we'd be in one big rock band and that we'd be staying in it for more than 20 years, and that sounds like a dream.
We realize how much we have been given and we are impressed that we can continue to play together.
We love each other and we love making music.
We’re lucky to be able to see the places we’ve always wanted.
We couldn't have gotten any better.
What did it mean to you that you were an important part of the emergence of the grunge genre?
It has always been an honor for us to be part of this group, where the giants themselves are represented.
The people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains are our friends.
It’s surprising when a movement arises from a group of friends, too often it doesn’t happen.
From time to time, a group is formed in the city, but it is much less common for five to ten groups to arise from one city at a time.
We are proud of that and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
Sometimes we play with some of them.
Last year we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour. We are lucky that they are all our friends and we are honored that we can be part of this movement that originated in Seattle.
It is also very unusual for a group like yours to stay together and have the same members over the years.
Yes, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which in itself is a much longer time than the usual duration of the group.
I think that first we are all lucky that we are still in this world, and secondly, the fact that we are always interested in each other plays a role.
We are all close friends and thanks to this we have managed to open up musical paths that leave everyone enough freedom to experiment.
We trust each other, we respect each other’s music, and I don’t think it could be any better.
Your relationship to the word of glory has not been easy. However, thanks to your success, you can do what you like.
How do you find balance?
As we grew up, it became easier and easier to find balance.
We try not to ride too much on tour because it is very easy to fall into this trap of crowds and people who love our music.
When you realize that people have come for music, you will remember that you have to respect the music and what you have given it. You must not get carried away by being famous, rock stars. This has never really interested any of us.
What do you think of the upcoming Mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote great songs and in the beginning it was something great.
As a band, we were in existence for three years and never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
It was very frustrating, because it took so long. The most important thing is that we still be friends today with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us. When I listen to a song or look at the photos, I remember Andy, how I used to like him, how he was so incredulous.
She was an incredible person and we miss her very much.
The national band Las Robertas will be commissioned to launch the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose them as your forerunners?
Yes, the production sent us videos with a few suggestions and we liked this group the most. That is why we are curious what Las Robertas will offer live and they must be very entertaining.
Why do you always change the words "Yellow Ledbetter" live?
That's a question about Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he adds the first thing that comes to mind.
Who influences you as a bassist?
A lot of people.
Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many of them that I could talk all night about the bassists that I like.
How did Pearl Jam manage to keep the grunge even though it is no longer in fashion?
I think we've all always felt a slight separation from the word grunge.
When it comes to grunge, I think of the bands I’ve mentioned like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all the others that came out at the same time. And if the music is still valid today, then it’s something great because it’s music that’s worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are better off playing today than ever before.
In the beginning your music had a slightly gloomy character and now it is more positive.
What is behind this change?
That’s interesting because I feel like there’s a few songs in the new album that are easier to digest, but there’s also songs like The End or Juste Breathe that are considered very gloomy, though they may sound positive.
In both of them, when Ed played them to me, I was crying, and the songs are deep dark.
I think that when you grow up and have some trauma in your life, you lose someone in your family or a friend, these things begin to affect your art and music, and these two songs represent just that to me.
I also think you can be a happy person and still make gloomy music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalised again for medical tests
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday at a public hospital where he will be tested for muscle loss he suffers in the lower extremities, his attending physician said.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights violations committed by his government (1990-2000), suffers from several ailments, including cancer of the tongue, which has led to his having been operated on four times and is already under the control of doctors.
Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told Canal N television that Fujimori will undergo tests at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases in three days, where they should find out why he is in pain and why he is losing strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga said that in his opinion, Fujimori could receive mercy for humanitarian reasons, but the former president himself does not want mercy because he feels innocent.
He was operated on four times for cancer of the tongue, dropped 18 kilograms and other ailments such as severe erosive gastritis, cyst on the pancreas, kidney stones, high pressure and circulatory problems in the legs were added to these problems, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been serving his sentence since September 2007 at the National Directorate of Special Police Operations.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the deaths of 25 people killed by a killing squad of troops operating illegally in the first years of his rule.
Mujica to visit Mexico to strengthen political ties
The official delegation, led by Uruguayan President José Mujica, accompanied by several ministers and businessmen, will begin their visit to Mexico on Tuesday, with the aim of expanding trade between the two nations and touching on the political issues of the region.
Mujica will meet on Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n. This is the most important meeting of the extensive visit of a full meeting with representatives of politics, trade and representatives of the Uruguayan community living in Mexico. The program was published by the Uruguayan presidential office.
The meeting of the two presidents in Guadalajara will serve to exchange information on political issues between the two countries," the Uruguayan presidential office said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica will try to get Calder<0xC3><0xB3>n to support Uruguay in the dispute with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy put South America on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened that the countries that will continue to hold the position of tax havens would be expelled from the international community. This statement prompted a negative opinion on the part of Uruguay and a consultation with the ambassador in this European country.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November. The G20 is a group of the most powerful developing and developed countries in the world. Since January this year, it has concluded an agreement with the Latin American country to exchange information to prevent double taxation.
In recent years, the Uruguayan government has sought to make fiscal exchange agreements more concrete in order to get out of the "black paper" of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), to which there are countries that have not implemented all the required international standards of cooperation in the field of taxation.
From a commercial point of view, Mexico and Uruguay have concluded the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) since 2004, which has led to a strengthening of the exchange of goods between the two countries.
The bearded installer runs in 3D thanks to "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has been fighting tirelessly for more than 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but has never appeared in 3D: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of a girl with stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes to all stores around the world this month, has been designed from the start to take advantage of all the features offered by the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play three-dimensional games without having to wear glasses.
"Mario is a character who has to say how stereoscopy should work without glasses," Omar <0xC3><0x81>lvarez, a press officer at Nintendo in Spain, said during a video game presentation in Madrid.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game created specifically for this carrier", because until now successful images such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of already existing titles.
A Nintendo spokesperson said that in addition to the footage being 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "available" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and smooth game.
<0xC3><0x81>lvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple", whose task is to attract less skilled users.
Once you have passed this level, you can get into the "second round" at levels of the game that are more challenging this time.
In addition, users can choose a real time between "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action. However, it will be necessary to play in 3D to be able to overcome the various challenges and "not succumb to optical deception".
This new appearance of Super Maria in 3D also implies the return of the character to the portable console, which has not happened since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo plays to the notes of those who watch the saga and repeats the successful formula from the previous parts. It consists in the fact that the installer of the bearded man will have to go through dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in the moves, in the surroundings, in the disguises and also among the enemies, there will also appear "playful" Luigi.
Colom approved the release of Portilla to the United States
President <0xC3><0x81>lvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he had taken steps to issue former President Alfons Portillo, who is set to answer in the United States for a conspiracy to launder $70 million.
This is how the process ends, which was aimed at Guatemala responding to the request of the northern country, which demands the release of Portilla, so that it can judge him.
At a press conference, Colom confirmed that his decision is consistent with the independence of the judiciary and the executive branch and that he remembers that the criminal court has already ordered the extradition.
He made sure that during his term of office he did not "interfere" in court decisions and allowed all issues that got on his desk.
In addition to Portilla, Sergio Ruano Marroqu<0xC3><0xAD>n will be charged with murder and serious injury to health, and Edgar Estrada Morales and V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
Colom’s move means a step toward execution after all judicial and constitutional bodies have been exhausted to prosecute the former president, who ruled from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Tribunal and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be issued after his legal situation in Guatemala is resolved and human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was found not guilty of embezzling $120 million from the Department of Defense during his presidency, a process that preceded the release, but the Department of Public Prosecutions appealed and brought the case back to court.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people at risk
The organization was created to help children without education not to be on the fringes of society.
The balance of the first 25 years of the existence of the Trinijove social support organisation is very important: 6,000 young people at risk of social exclusion have been helped. The organisation has been helping them overcome difficult situations for 25 years.
To this must be added the long hundred jobs that have been obtained for this social group.
Yesterday’s anniversary was also used to present the balance sheet as part of the ceremony that took place in the former Fabra i Coats factory production premises and was attended by more than 300 people.
Trinijove was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 to help young people with low education, no work, drug addiction or social exclusion.
Yesterday’s meeting in Sant Andreu was attended by a large number of representatives of organizations and institutions that have cooperated with the association over the past 25 years.
The diverse political representation, at the time of the elections, showed the unified nature of the work carried out by Trinijeve.
Together with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, former socialist education adviser Ernest Maragall and former deputy mayor and current ecological-socialist councillor Ricard Goma attended the ceremony.
The large hall Fabra i Coats was also visited by the current Social Welfare and Family Advisor, Josep Llu<0xC3><0xAD>s Cleries, and the Director General of Social Work at La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas said that Trinijove was created at a very difficult time and that today also presents a number of obstacles, but added that the work that the association has brought to this day, "is a good foundation."
The president cited Trini as an example of how it is possible to fight against adverse circumstances and how to give courage to people in difficult situations.
"The crisis is nothing new for this organization and for the work it does," he said.
There was the emigration of a rented house, in which giant parties were held
The intruders took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building in Balmes, 51
12 occupiers left the house yesterday at noon without resisting
All indications are that the nightmare experienced by the neighbors of number 51 in Balmes Street is finally over.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building at noon yesterday, where they illegally lived and where they organized giant parties that woke up neighbors. They left the building from the court order and without having to intervene the police.
After the operation, the lock on the door was replaced to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on, the entrance will be guarded," the administrator said.
The occupiers, who took 11 of the 13 apartments in the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all electrical and partly water facilities, in addition to painting the walls and leaving behind waste of all kinds, especially cans after alcoholic beverages.
In the first three apartments there were huge parties, which lasted up to two days and woke up the other tenants.
Next to the building is a discotheque, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat, explained to Europa Press that while the building was occupied, sales fell by 80%.
The owner of the discotheque emphasizes that the occupants of the building made her unfair competition, because they sold drinks for 3 euros, while the discotheque costs 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment company had to respond to the complaints of neighbors due to noise. However, the problems were not caused by the visitors of the discotheque, but by the inhabitants of the house taken away and especially those who participated in the parties held here, the frequency and intensity of which has increased in recent weeks, according to discord.
The owner of the disco explained that the problems were so great that they even agreed with the owner of the building and for nine months she forgives her rent.
The city police also confirmed that in recent weeks they have received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
Last week, the mayor of the city’s Popular Party party, Alberto Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez D<0xC3><0xAD>az, demanded that “the building be immediately evacuated and thus put an end to the problems of civic coexistence suffered by its neighbors and the destruction of the area”.
The President of the Peoples explained that only one floor had been removed before the summer, but in recent months the occupiers have reached all floors of the building and almost all apartments, and in one of them there has even been theft.
In this regard, he added that "it is necessary to end impunity and be consistent when it comes to acts against civil liability that occurred in the building".
Yesterday, the city police also cleared the building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m., police reached building 35 on Mont-ral Street after being called by neighbors who saw four people entering the building.
All four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountains?
The architects met on the occasion of the discharge of the proceedings, which brings with it more than a controversy about the fees
The city’s 16-gate selection procedure is once again opening the debate on the role of Collserola Park in Barcelona.
In the mid-1980s, at the time of the greatest flowering of the already defunct Corporaci<0xC3><0xB3>n Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this municipality printed several pamphlets in support of Collserola Park.
The flyer defined the mountain as a large metropolitan park of Barcelona.
What’s more, it was supplemented by a numerical comparison with New York’s Central Park.
After the disappearance of the CMB in 1987, the park came back to the minds of many as the upper border of Barcelona. The Catalan metropolis is one of the few that do not orient themselves to the north - south axis, but up (up) - down (sea).
The qualification of Collserola as a natural park goes in this direction.
The reference was no longer Central Park, but Yellowstone with wild boars instead of the Yogi bear.
This was the position until September, when the city hall announced a mega competition consisting of 16 competitions for the same number of entrance gates to Collserola.
Of course, the gate records rather the idea of the park.
Either this, or someone's trying to put the gate on the field.
So the only question is: Collserola, park or mountain?
During the competition, both from a purely organizational point of view and on the basis of a reflection on the city, this question becomes the central theme of all Barcelona architects.
It is already a topic as blunt as when two members of this old caste, chosen at the meeting in the elevator, shake hands.
And it is precisely this act that has sparked one of the rare coincidences between what three Barcelona architects and previous university professors think.
Miguel Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the selection procedure has its merits.
According to Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n, after the question of the side of the bay, "it is necessary" to discuss the "mountain side", so that Ildefonso Cerda's speech on green apples was not called to the end.
"We have to start from the principle that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, its high availability.
Collserola is more complex," said the architect, for whom the name "gateway to Collserola" carries a "lexicological trap": we must not imagine them "as entrances to the park, but rather as the definition of zones where it is possible to act".
Modol, as well as Rold<0xC3><0xA1>n and Bayona with experience from the world of urbanism, qualifies the proposal as an "intellectual challenge" posing "some dangers".
The danger arising from the "uncertainty that the public space project represents today" after the experience of the 1980s, which had in the Forum "its swan song".
The first concern is the very definition of the boundaries where it should be built.
"To define something is to take the next step," that is, to move one step further.
“It is necessary to keep in mind new urban planning and planning tools, because the current ones (with reference to the General Metropolitan Plan (GMP)) can cause a real disaster.”
If we focus on the question in more detail, Modol believes that the valley slope of Collserola can be "considered a park", but not the Barcelona part, for purely topographical reasons.
Modol also recalled that there is already work carried out by the Patronat de Collserola, which "must not end up in the garbage", although he welcomes the fact that the town hall offers his gremio that it will intervene in the project from the "first moment".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain and the city is a kind of leeway that allows architects to get involved in the debate, but he "doubts" that it should be precisely this technical profile that will lead multidisciplinary teams ("it's all about skills", he adds), which needs to be created: "Architects should be tools only".
Bayona suggests that the answer to the question that gave the name of this game is complex, because the global vision of Collserol is missing in the selection process documents: "There have been announced 16 selection procedures that deal with all the axis of the mountain - the sea, but there is no longitudinal study that would make it ".
This means that at least he has applied to all 16 tenders.
Otherwise, the design of a single gate may come up against the concept and definition of a neighboring gate architect.
In his opinion, the town hall should guarantee that the zone located directly above Ronda de Dalt should provide throughout the whole length of the zone equipment that would ensure a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
Casino misses Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal to be released
After 72 days in prison, legal representative Cadino Red pardoned Mayor Monterrey's brother in a trial in which he was prosecuted for alleged blackmail.
Manuel Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal has spent 72 days in prison and will now be released after being pardoned by the legal representative of Casino Red before the Second Criminal Court in that district, which was considering a case of extortion in which the brother of the mayor of Monterrey was charged.
After the Casino Royale attack, Casina Red owner Sergio Gil Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a posted a series of photos and videos in which Manuel Jonas was asked to pay him an economic quota to allow the Monterrey City Hall to operate illegally in a betting house.
After the public prosecution, the State Prosecutor's Office initiated the criminal prosecution of the brother of the panic mayor. On September 2, he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
Then, after 4 hours spent in front of Public Prosecutor's Agent No. 3 for property offenses, he was transferred to Prison 1, located in Barrio Antiguo in the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days after a second arrest warrant was issued and a Public Prosecutor's agent denied the possibility of complicity or organized crime.
On 19 October, he was transferred to a criminal court in Cadereyta on suspicion of blackmailing the owners of Casina Red in the amount of one and a half million pesos. However, he remained only a few hours in prison with moderate supervision because he was threatened with death.
During the trial, he was allowed to remain in city cells in San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza.
On October 25, he was presented with an arrest warrant issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Jorge Y<0xC3><0xA1>nez, who stated that after almost two months of investigation, sufficient evidence had been collected to prove Jonas' guilt. The evidence includes, for example, a payment of 1.5 million euros in fines.
This Monday, the legal representative of Casina Red, V<0xC3><0xAD>ctor Aldo Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez, surrendered to the judge José Luis Pecin and asked for mercy for the brother of the mayor of the region. On this basis, he will soon be able to return to freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the public prosecutor's representative assigned to this court, Ramiro Arias, asked Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a G<0xC3><0xB3>mez whether the damage had been repaired and which of the partners had decided to grant the pardon.
On the basis of official file 197/2011, a legal pardon is granted to Jon<0xC3><0xA1>s Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal. In the process that was conducted against him, no complaint can be filed. It is also not possible to claim damages or punishment.
After an interview with the legal representative at around 15:50, the court ordered the immediate release of Larraz<0xC3><0xA1>bal Bret<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The court’s secretary, Jorge Yanez, arrived at the prison in San Nicol<0xC3><0xA1>s de los Garza to announce to Jonas that he had been granted an official pardon and that his case had been postponed to the archives.
He also informed him that the judge had issued an immediate order for his release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come presented details of the plane crash that killed the secretary of the governor, Francisco Blake, and seven others.
The Secretariat for Communications and Transport (SCT) reported that the results of an investigation into the crash that killed Secretary of State Francisco Blake Mora and seven other people showed that the helicopter had hit the ground with full force without the pilot having a chance to attempt a forced landing.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come, Secretary for Communications and Transport, said that before the launch of the aircraft, the pilot stated that climatic conditions allow flights.
"The parts that appear indicate that the unit came into contact with the terrain several times, the wings became entangled in the branches of the trees 25 meters from the place where the unit lost the torso."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 people, therefore it met all requirements for the transport of personnel.
In addition, he stated that no components were found on the ground as a result of an investigation carried out in the area of the accident.
"In the search, it was found that parts of the plane were not in another location, so the plane came across the land as a whole.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 people, it met all the requirements for transporting people.
The terrain shows a slope with a slope of seven to thirty degrees.
The secretary assured that at the moment it is most important to get results as quickly as possible. However, the investigation may take several months or up to a year.
Gilberto L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Meyer, Director General of Airports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the crash, the helicopter of the Presidential General Staff was moving at cruising speed and the accident occurred on soft terrain.
"This information supports the hypothesis that at the time of the accident it was a normal overflight operation," he said.
At a press conference, SCT representative Pérez J<0xC3><0xA1>come mentioned six basic points of investigation:
Visual flight:
In accordance with aviation standards, the flight was carried out according to the visual flight rules, which means that the crew must see the terrain during the flight.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM indicate adequate conditions at take-off, in accordance with which the aircraft advances towards the border, between the DF and the State of Mexico were visible layers of clouds at low altitudes.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the clouds, the crew was looking for a lower area and greater visibility as far as the Cuernavaca Valley.
The location of the impact.
The coordinates of the impact and the last record of the helicopter from the radar coincide, it is likely that before the impact there was no loss of control or disruption of the trajectory of the flight.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a restricted area:
The information we currently have at our disposal allows us to assume that the collision occurred on a straight trajectory and from the side.
The diagram of the dispersion of the remnants of the aircraft suggests that at the time of the impact on the ground, the helicopter was intact.
There was no fire or explosion.
At the scene of the accident, there was no evidence that there was an explosion or fire.
The latest results of the investigation show that there may have been several contacts with the land.
During the field work, remnants of the aircraft were found at an altitude of up to 9,200 feet above sea level, the terrain is sloping, the height of the slope goes from seven to 30 degrees.
The photographs show images in which there was probably a break-up along the mentioned route.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter could have come into contact with the ground at several locations.
After a careful search in the vicinity of the accident, no remains of the helicopter were found in an area larger than the designated area, which reinforces the assumption that the crash occurred in a state where the helicopter was still intact.
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance has started research on the gene that causes obesity
The Institute of Health Insurance conducts research in order to discover the gene responsible for obesity in children and adolescents. The research is carried out with the support of experts from the Institute IPN
The Mexican Institute of Health Insurance (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to detect the gene causing obesity in children and adolescents. Research called "Genetics of obesity in children and adolescents" will allow to obtain results related to overweight.
In a report, Miguel Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez, head of the Biochemistry Research Unit at the Specialized Hospital of the National Health Center of the 21st Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers had been established.
This team is based on the support of specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The research can also be carried out by the general public, with or without permission. People can come to the participating IMSS sports centers in Valle de México, where each council from 8 a.m. will carry out tests for adolescents.
He stressed that the research began at the Cuauhtémoc Sports Center (Mexico State) and since October 8 this activity is also carried out at the Nezahualc<0xC3><0xB3>yolt Sports Center (Eastern Mexico State).
Once data from 500 to 600 children are obtained, the study will continue at the Independencia Sports Center (south of the Federal District) and finally at the Morelos Sports Center (north of the Federal Center).
He explained that the aim of this research is to determine the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity, and to trace risk factors on Mexican children and young people, thereby preventing the emergence of chronic degenerative diseases.
On the occasion of the International Diabetes Day, which is celebrated on 14 November, he recalled that the aim is to collect data from three thousand children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and under the supervision of their parents, for the application of specific questionnaires on nutrition.
The questionnaire will also ask about physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases in order to avoid risk factors that could cause diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He clarified that every Saturday anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference) are carried out with all participants, blood pressure is measured, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, insulin levels are determined, and genes are examined (trying to identify genes that are involved in the formation of children).
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez said this research reflects health care providers’ concerns about the alarming increase in child weight.
'Health surveys conducted between 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years, only boys had an increase in obesity by 77% and girls by 47%. There was also a dramatic increase in overweight,' said an expert from the IMSS.
He said that one of the reasons for looking for indicators is the assumption that the population of the country is different from other populations by its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican has 65% of the Indian-American genetic equipment, 30% of the European and 5% of the African. This fact is reflected in the genes that are responsible for the formation of diabetes and overweight.
He explained that, in general, the genetics of obesity are commonly explained as the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit of the participants is that they are given an overall assessment of the condition of the children, which will determine whether they are overweight or obese.
He said that even the presence of dark-colored wrinkles (acantosis) on the neck and forearms indicates the likelihood that the individual will suffer from metabolic problems and prediabetes.
The information is confidential so far, doctors hand it over in writing to the parents and explain to them all the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make in order to avoid their children getting sick.
Cruz L<0xC3><0xB3>pez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic diseases: a sedentary lifestyle that means a lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the TV all day and using means of transport instead of walking for short distances.
Excess weight is also caused by a large caloric intake, i.e. greater consumption of sweetened beverages, carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetic load that is the subject of this research.
Asphalt from UNAM will not be emptied
Rafael Herrera, a scientist from the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry, creates modified asphalts with polymers and thus creates a mixture with better functionality, regardless of climatic conditions and temperature
If the landfill was properly cared for, there would be no need to repair nearly 200,000 landfills after each rainy season in the Metropolitan Area of Valle de México, said Rafael Herrera N<0xC3><0xA1>jera, a scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who also added that if the construction and maintenance of the landfills were to be completed, it would be possible to repair the landfill.
In his lecture The Technological Cause of Extinction, which he gave in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory under his leadership is developing modified asphalts with polymers, thus creating a mixture having similar characteristics to asphalt, but at the same time greater mechanical resistance, as well as to it.
Herrer N<0xC3><0xA1>jera believes that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places with extremely warm climates, for example in some cities in the north of the country, thus improving functionality and reducing the formation of landslides.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a grouping of hydrocarbon molecules, molecules with a large molecular weight, which are called asphaltenes, and others with a low molecular weight, which are called maltenes. Together they supply asphalt typical viscous.
The viscoelastic nature of asphalt is that at high temperatures, around 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees it has a high viscosity and at 50 degrees it is almost in a solid state, while at low temperatures asphalt tends to break, he added.
This means that the resistance of asphalt in the streets is not uniform, but changes during the day according to weather conditions and temperatures, noted the expert on chemical engineering.
A scientist from the Faculty of Chemistry observed that most of the streets in Ciudad de México are covered with a flexible tile consisting of six layers of materials, the last three of which are mixed with asphalt.
Among the highest layers is the asphalt insert, formed by small stones poured into the asphalt and then compressed.
He stressed that every stone that forms an insert is poured with asphalt.
When passing cars or when creating pressure, it is possible for forces in the tile to decompose well.
If it were a modified asphalt, it would have decomposed even better, according to a chemical engineer.
He added that on the asphalt insert is placed the last layer called the mantle, formed by fine stones, that is, sand also poured into the asphalt.
Since this layer will come into contact with the rims of the vehicles, it must have greater mechanical strength than the asphalt insert and must ensure the friction of the road.
Since as part of the paving will be exposed to a large load, the shell must be of sufficient thickness and attention must be paid to the material from which it is made.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature changes, are also very important factors to keep in mind. In particular, water has a great influence on the functionality of the asphalt insert.
Once the terrain is wet, the water spreads inward and it is difficult to get out, this causes softening of all layers of the tile and thus the formation of mulch.
He explained that during the formation of abrasions, the film of the casing is first destroyed and then the asphalt insert is damaged. However, the damage does not occur at one moment, but it is a slow process that should be stopped at the first signs with the help of appropriate maintenance programs.
As a member of the National System of Scientists, he also explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor in the formation of debris, and therefore the thickness of each individual layer of the pavement must correspond to the load of vehicles and must guarantee that this load will not be exceeded.
Rafael Herrera pointed out that we still have a lot of work ahead of us when it comes to asphalt and research is at the beginning. For example, asphalt emulsions are worth mentioning, which are already available in other countries on the market and make it easy to repair excavations without having to use high temperatures.
What was the missing candidate from Valle to become the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of factors that contributed to the fact that Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna did not win the Miss Colombia crown.
Valle thus wins the 14th title of the first multi-mission.
Valle del Cauca again failed to reach the Miss Colombia crown.
Melina Ram<0xC3><0xAD>rez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of the winner, won a silver crown and a sherpa, on the basis of which she became the first multi-mission Colombia.
Based on the results of yesterday's finals in Cartagena (1993), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1987), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1987), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1987), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1987), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a) and Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a) and Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989) and Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a (1989), Giul<0xC3><0xAD>a, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, born, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, divorced, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married, married
A question that many people ask themselves. What was missing?
The result is the defeat of a big favorite, which in all previous rounds showed that she wants to become the new Miss Colombia, and not in vain became the Queen of Police and the Most Beautiful Face of Joile de Volgue. These titles were achieved by, for example, Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who also succeeded to the title of Miss Colombia.
One of the key factors that determined that the jury decided to name her only First Multimission is the fact that she did not convince her answer to the question: "Which book did you like the most and why?", which was put by Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Murillo G<0xC3><0xB3>mez of the literary editorial office of Leamos.
To the question, the candidate replied:
"I read a lot. I believe in the role of literature, I think it is one of the forms of culture. The book that influenced me the most in my childhood was "Little Prince", a very deep book.
Currently I am reading "Crime and Punishment". It is a book that is part of the worldwide literature that we should all know. And today I have with me a book by Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian author. It is a wonderful book called "El ardor de la sangre".
This answer was not liked both because of the term "culturalizing" and, secondly, because the candidate did not explain what the individual books mentioned marked her.
At the end of the ceremony Melina declared that she was at peace and delighted with the result: "The world is wise what is to happen will happen.
And you people, read if you can. The little prince is a wonderful book."
One of the other hypotheses is that Valle has destroyed the position of the favorite.
The Bogot<0xC3><0xA1> journalist suggested that the fact that the candidate was from the beginning the most popular, the most celebrated, and the one who took away all previous awards (Gastronomic Challenge Oster, the title of the public for the best artistic dress and Queen Mother), aroused the envy of other candidates, then pushed them to the brink.
This was evident during the first presentation of the swimsuits at the Hilton beach and during the two shows before the final coronation.
Although she shone on both, it was known that she lacked the strength and enthusiasm shown by the representatives of Magdalena and the Atlantic.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist for the program "Like at Home" on Canal RCN, believes that the fact that Melinda won the title of the first multi-mission confirms the fact that the candidate who wins the most titles during the competition does not eventually leave with the crown of the queen.
Moreover, in recent days, Valle has had a rather unkind attitude towards the media, and it has not paid off.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of his interest in social work, which is the basis of the National Beauty Contest.
Just two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doughty said she was looking for a woman who would be aware of her country’s social needs.
"In Miss Colombia beauty is not enough in itself, it is necessary to see something more than just physical beauty. It is necessary to focus on social feelings. It is important that the candidates are involved in such projects even before they enter the competition", she explained.
It is also speculated that candidate Valle lost points due to deficiencies in her background and fibrosis, which was evident on the butt. But this is completely contrary to the verdict of the jury, which chose her miss "natural beauty" for the healthiest body, proper nutrition and responsible physical activity.
Jorge Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Orozco, who is preparing the queen, admits that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better girls, "but problems with fibrosis on the buttocks, which in my opinion was not too noticeable, took points until the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of Cromos magazine believes that the Valle native made a mistake when she underwent several surgeries.
"Surgical procedures are fine, but they didn't work in Valle.
The body was never her strong suit, and here she chose her tax.”
Because of this award, which was first given by the National Beauty Assembly, after the swimwear show, a cruel prediction came true. It was claimed that this was the satisfaction that Raymundo Melina gave, so that he did not have to give her the highest crown in the end.
Whether true or not, it is certain that Melina has started the year of her reign today, not as a queen, but as a princess, from a position that gives her the opportunity to represent Colombia in various international competitions, where she will be named the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite the overwhelming success in Cartagena, did not achieve the highest crown.
This was the work of Cali, who identified the corpse of Alfonso Cana.
An expert on fingerprints from Cali went down in history as a man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cana.
The work of these officials is crucial.
On 4 November last year, a fingerprint expert from the CTI in Cali made history as a man who confirmed the identity of Farc's supreme leader: "Alfonse Cana", through a comparison of fingerprints.
Of the seven fingerprinting experts working in the CTI department, Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez, a man from Puerta Tejada who has been working in forensic research for 21 years, was in line this week.
At the beginning of his career, Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez worked at the town hall in Choc<0xC3><0xB3>, where he often had to spend more than five days exploring the forest to get to the place where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to the capital of Valle and after taking the appropriate courses, he began to specialize in fingerprints. This science deals with the study of the friction of the skin, i.e. the palms of the hands and feet.
In the week of the operation against Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was told to take his clothes with him for at least three days.
Something big was expected.
On Friday night he went to Cauc in a helicopter from Palmyra.
He knew that he would have to identify two bodies and that he suspected one of them was a man who was leading the world's oldest guerrilla. That's why they asked him to take a card with fingerprints of Guillermo Le<0xC3><0xB3>n Saenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigating team at the place where the body was located, he did not recognize it because of the physical appearance. He looked completely different than in the media.
He had no beard, dressed like a villager in a given area, without glasses, much thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Along with a galton magnifying glass, ink, and a transplanter, Eliazar began to compare the dactylic records of the corpse with those of the card.
Her eye did not disappoint: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, a man from Puerto Tejada was commissioned to confirm to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinz<0xC3><0xB3>n, whether he was indeed the supreme commander of the Farc.
Searching for Stops
For the dactyloscope from Sij<0xC3><0xAD>n de Cali, the recognition given to Eliazar Gonz<0xC3><0xA1>lez by President Juan Manuel Santos at the press conference of the operational service against "Cano" is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an exact science, with no possibility of error, which can play a key role in the decision-making of crimes.
In addition to identifying the bodies, these people help investigate crimes such as theft or murder and confirm the identity of the persons caught.
When caught, a lot of delinquents present false documents or have no papers at all.
We'll take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator told that in case of injury, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house in the house, because in this place the thief leaned to pull out a safe full of jewelry and money.
The walls are difficult because they are not intended for fingerprinting, but in this case we were able to get a full handprint and identify the perpetrator who participated in several thefts,” he said.
Fingerprints can also confirm or disprove suspicions in the event of a murder.
They recently found a dead man with bottles of alcohol around him.
Based on the investigation, it turned out that one of the family members could be responsible for the murder, and the imprint on the bottle actually confirmed this.
Although it cannot be 100% confirmed that he was indeed a murderer, it is clear that he appeared on the scene of the crime.
A CTI fingerprint expert explained that the fingerprints “are erased using chemical or physical reactive substances” from the objects.
When they appear, a transplanter or tape is used to collect them.
Then the prints are sent to Asif, which is a database of criminals, or to the Registry.
"The problem is that there are still many Colombians whose data is not recorded anywhere at the moment," the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the TV program CSI.
Just as everything that glitters is not gold, not everything that you touch remains traces.
However, if it can be used, the relevant comparison must be made.
'Indignation' Protests in New York City
Hundreds of protesters crowded into Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to live.
A large part of them were waiting for the order to clear the space and moved to a nearby park.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement provoked New York officials on Tuesday when they tried to get back to Manhattan Square with a court order, from where they were taken out in the morning, then tried to take over another New York park.
Hundreds of protesters rushed to Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to get to thanks to a court order that allows the "angry" to return to settle on the spot. The second part of the movement responded to the eviction by taking the park to the north of the city, where further detentions took place.
"If the court does not allow us to return to the square, we will settle in another place and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, both through assembly and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Wall Street Movement.
Bray clarified that the response of the “angry” to the camp’s displacement, ordered by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg himself, reached the court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the violent displacement of the site and allowing the protesters to establish themselves here and there.
In addition, the "anger" took over another park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and the land of the lighthouse in Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to take the place, but then the police came and detained some protesters. Bray did not know the exact number, but said that he saw that some journalists had also been chained.
The organization assures that several hundred people have settled on the site. Also, a delegation of religious representatives came to express their support and also tried to negotiate with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is a private property, remains closed. A court hearing is expected, which should take place on Tuesday, and during which the legality of the morning evacuation should be analyzed.
Some of the displaced protesters even distributed and handed out copies of the court order and even gave them to members who were guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes", Bray said, condemning the fact that some police protesters were beaten.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of the Ocupa Wall Street movement or applying “laws that were published after the lockdown began, or prohibiting protesters from accessing the park with shops or other places they used to use.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that due to this court order, the city had suspended the reopening of public space and the protesters warned that local laws would not allow them to return to their tents and dormitories.
The city’s top official personally defended the early evacuation of Zuccotti Square, an operation that detained 200 people and was acceded to because protesters “violated the law.”
Bloomberg explained that he had ordered the evacuation of the square because it had become “a place where people did not go to protest but to break the laws and in some cases hurt others” because “some shops received threatening letters” and “neighbors were concerned about the quality of their lives”.
“The early clean-up was appalling and shows that Bloomberg is trying to maintain financial interests at the expense of the American working people,” said a spokesman for the movement, which accused the mayor of “not respecting freedom of expression.”
Representatives of the Occupy Wall Street movement also said they plan to hold "big events" on Thursday in cooperation with community and trade union organizations to remind them of the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will be presenting the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas TV show.
Together with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement", a swimmer on "Baywatch", a bunny on "Playboy", the wife of year-old musician Tommy Lee and now an actress and model will be the Virgin Mary on a special Christmas show on Canadian television.
Private television station CTV today announced that Anderson, along with sentimental singer Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the December 1 episode of "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and will portray the Virgin Mary.
CTV today showed footage from a television program in which Anderson, also known from online home pornographic images, appears with her ex-husband, the "M<0xC3><0xB6>tley Cr<0xC3><0xBC>e" engine, Tommy Lee, as the Virgin Mary holding a doll representing Jesus in the manger.
As Joseph, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin, recently appeared on the stage as a host on Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the Canadian singer Bublé will appear on the special Christmas broadcast CTV, who married in Buenos Aires at the end of March with Argentine model Luisana Lopilato, and who is close to controversy.
Recently, Bublé called Kim Kardashian an "asshole" at one of her concerts in New York City.
Japan is coming back to life after a devastating earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to household consumption, ending a period of decline that began in March
Since March last year, Japan’s economy has been paralyzed, now recovering from a devastating earthquake that has escalated into a nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the country has faced since World War II.
Initial estimates by the Tokyo government have put the material losses at $300 billion, a blow that is healing well despite the difficult global situation.
After three quarters of declines, the value of GDP between July and September reached such a position that it was possible to turn the page with definitive validity: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% per year.
In addition, the results of the second quarter - for the Japanese, the tax year begins in March 2012 - assume the highest growth rate compared to the period January to March 2010.
The revival can be partly explained by the purchase of machines that are necessary for the restoration of areas destroyed by earthquakes and subsequent tsunamis.
Companies increased their investments by 1.1%, spending fell by 0.9% compared to the period January to March. This is the first decline after six months of continuous growth.
However, the real awakening of the Japanese economy is based solely on the impulse that forces us to use the crisis to get out of it, or to rebuild infrastructure, and that is to use the shortfall to start from scratch.
Japan has woken up, thanks in particular to the development of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan's GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, thanks to an increase in spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
Stigma yenu
Toky entrusted itself to the hands of the internal market, when the yen - the Japanese currency - became one of the "saving values" for investors fleeing from the eurozone debt crisis and from the worrying US forecasts. It is a privilege, but at the same time a great burden for export companies.
With a stronger currency, products abroad are more expensive, which is negative for a country whose economy is determined by the financial health of large technological groups.
For example, Toyota or Sony attributed their weak results to the yen exchange rate in July and September.
While markets continue to surround the EU’s border countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government is cautious.
“We need to be aware of the risks that persist, such as the destruction of some foreign economies, the impact of flooding in Thailand and the rapid increase in the yen,” said Motohisa Furukawa, the secretary of state for economic policy.
In fact, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said that most member states showed clear signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator, which predicts inflexibility in the world economy, has shown that the economy of the major powers is slowing down.
It fell by four tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The Eurozone even fell below the 100-point average, reaching a level of 99.13 points.
Athens is spreading uncertainty again.
Papadimos says austerity measures will be approved, but conservatives won’t sign any written pledges
With rapid and risky border guarantees and uncertainty once again taking hold, Greece is increasingly entangled in a labyrinth that leads to a way out of Europe’s major debt crisis.
The assumption that the “agreement” of the new transitional Greek government is given to the demands of Brussels rather than the true conviction of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, admitted yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of 100 days he received at his appointment will probably be short for their application, the chairman of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, declared that the new austerity measures were in no way enacted after the election, and that the new austerity measures were in no way imposed after the election.
"The main task of this government is to implement the decision of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said during a parliamentary debate that culminates tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the government.
A package of 24 programmes to support employment, reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against tax evasion will be among the first initiatives.
However, Samarase’s message does not clarify any doubts about his position: “We pledged to help the transitional government, but we did not commit to anything else.”
In his speech to the EU and the IMF, the chairman of the Conservatives went a little too far. These organizations are supposed to unblock the 8 billion that Athens urgently needs. At the same time, he said that he will not support and sign any commitment to implement austerity measures.
The European Commission, already outraged by the impact of Papandre's games with the referendum, yesterday stressed that its demands are insurmountable: it will not block any aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main parties sign a "written commitment without ambiguity and as far as possible".
Economic Affairs Spokesman Amadeu Altafaj explained that the Troika inspectors will return to Athens "very soon" and will negotiate with the new government about "what it needs to pay for the sixth part" 8 billion. However, the definitive date does not exist.
The Greek prairie has a little bit more to do.
Queen Sofia: "There are tools for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain’s privileged position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a significant position at the global level in terms of microfinance".
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that in the last two decades, the country has become the second donor of the planet in terms of this instrument of cooperation, the essence of which lies in the fact that "it is an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all mankind. It is a tool based on humanity".
The Queen yesterday launched the 5th World Microloan Summit in Valladolid, with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operation is "completely necessary" for us to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015.
Spain "will continue to work" and expand the network of volunteers "in all corners of the planet and take this task responsibly", said Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contribution of the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "will ensure the creation of better capacities and opportunities"
"We have achieved a lot" and "many challenges are still ahead of us".
The microloans summit is intended to be not only a discussion forum, but also a platform that will support the "fundamental goals".
Her Majesty explained that the goal is for 175 million poor families to have access to these financial services by the end of 2015 and for 100 million families to rise above the poverty line under which they currently live.
The concept of microloans spread to Spain and other countries of the world after "the pioneer of the idea of Muhammad Yunus went on this path", the Queen said, adding that it was "an act of justice and necessary recognition".
The father of this tool described him as "an admirable idealist who set out on a journey to fight poverty". She became acquainted with his work 15 years ago when she went to Bangladesh to meet directly on the spot with his loan policy.
The first world summit in Washington and other meetings such as the Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006. "During all these meetings, I was able to note the constant development, explained the Queen, who, thanks to her support for this project, "earned the title of yesterday's bull".
Queen Sofia ended her speech by inviting participants to engage in discussions and search for solutions, thus allowing them to continue the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, said that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" that all democratic states must follow.
In this sense, she said, it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries only with the period of baloghobyt, because this cooperation is a “permanent obligation”.
Jiménez believes that microloans represent a “serious and honest policy aimed at eliminating poverty”, and now more than ever the governments of developed countries must work in accordance with the criteria of solidarity and not allow solidarity to become a victim of austerity.
For Spain, microloan is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez, welcomed the success, which celebrates a concept based on giving confidence to the people with whom everyone else closes the door. The Mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier Leon de la Riva, welcomed the participants in the city, which "opens its gates to solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect a European president on the basis of universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress was held in Leipzig on Monday, November 14, without serious problems for Chancellor and Christian Democratic Party (CDU) President Angela Merkel.
The question of the future of Europe was not originally on the agenda, but it was not until the autumn, especially to reassure party members who consider the government's policy towards the Greeks today and perhaps tomorrow towards the Italians to be lax.
The proposal concerning the President of the European Commission submitted by the Management Board was adopted almost unanimously.
Only nine of the 1001 delegates were against and 10 delegates abstained.
A few minutes of applause at the end of Angela Merkel’s speech and a few hours later Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>ubl, the very pro-European finance minister, left no room for doubt.
The main idea of the chancellor and the proposal can be summed up in the slogan: the answer to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not just because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
According to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, “the time for change has come.”
This could be expressed by changes in the Lisbon Treaty allowing the European Union to strengthen its control over the budgetary policies of the euro area Member States, but it could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of a universal suffrage "with the aim of giving Europe one face".
Such is in any case one of the ideas of the proposal adopted by the Congress, whose inspiration is clearly Wolfgang Sch<0xC3><0xA4>uble.
It is certainly unlikely that all twenty-seven countries will quickly agree on this revolutionary step: the United Kingdom is opposed and the leaders of the CDU think that Nicolas Sarkozy will take the same position.
But the direction is set.
Likewise, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to assess the weight of each country on the board of the European Central Bank, depending on the weight of its economy, which will obviously result in strengthening the weight of Germany.
Led by concerns about calming the climate within her party, the chancellor made several references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but did not try to get the Congress to talk about "small" European states or states in trouble willing to criticize arrogant Germany.
Although the proposal on Europe addresses one paragraph of the importance of the "French-German friendship", Angela Merkel did not quote France.
Only indirectly.
When she recalled that just two hundred years ago there was a bloody battle at Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the Napoleonic army.
What constitutes fraud in the event of incapacity for work?
After the support, the UMP party and the government launch an offensive against incapacity for work.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday 15 December and will visit the Office for Social Support, where he will deliver a speech on the topic of combating social fraud and the redistribution of solidarity since 2007.
As an accompaniment to this offensive, which is based on the will to make savings in the context of increased austerity, but is no less clear from the point of view of the right-wing presidential campaign, the right-wing majority wants to focus on incapacity for work.
First, because of the budgetary savings, the government intends to impose a fourth day of incapacity for work on private sector employees before they begin to receive sickness support.
To be clear, without the consent of the company, the employee who becomes ill would lose four days of salary, i.e. at least 15% of his monthly income.
A measure that risks causing a lot of bad blood, but which, according to Les Echos, could bring in 280 million euros.
And also measures that would be accompanied by other measures of symbolic reach: to give civil servants one day of unremunerated incapacity for work (until now they do not have any incapacity compared to three days in the private sector).
While these issues are the subject of debate, the right-wing majority is also launching a topic of fraud this time around, focusing on malpractices linked to working disabilities.
"The controls will be much more extensive and, moreover, if you are caught, you will return," Xavier Bertrand said in an interview with RTL on Sunday.
As in other cases, the effects of the notification appear to be somewhat disproportionate in view of the truth about the inequities in the event of incapacity for work.
In fact, these have been the subject of constant monitoring since 2002 and political pressure that has borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than anywhere else in Europe.
Let’s start with a few official numbers.
According to the Caisse nationale d'assurance maladie (CNAM), more than <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>237 million of daily allowances were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Health Research and Documentation, in 2008 daily reimbursements with their 11.3 billion euros represented 5% of health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% related to maternity benefits and work injuries and 54% related to incapacity for work, i.e. EUR 6.2 billion.
Only 2.5% of health care costs.
According to the Alma Consulting study, the French had an average of 14.5 days of incapacity for work in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009.
The average, which hides certain deviations: another survey published in 2007 on the site dealing with work opportunities Monster.com showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed answered that they had not chosen any day of incapacity for work.
Another study, this time conducted by health insurance institutions, specifies that in 2010 37.8% of incapacity for work was less than 8 days, 22% from 8 to 14 days, 15% from 15 days to 1 month, 15% from 1 to three months, and 11% lasted longer.
When we compare them with their European neighbours, French workers are no more prone to incapacity for work than elsewhere.
One long study conducted in 2010 by two researchers at the CNRS (National Research Centre) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall absence (for health reasons or not) ranged between 10% and 11.8% in France versus 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the UK and 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in the event of incapacity for work is only a very small part compared to black work.
As far as fraud is concerned, these are only to a small extent.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on incapacity for work of more than 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM found that for 1.5 million checks, 13.8% of the 285,000 carried out due to short-term incapacity were "unauthorised or too long", i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically controlled incapacity for more than 45 days, 11% of the cases were "unadjusted or unauthorised" on 1.2 million checks, i.e. 132,000.
A total of 169,000 "unauthorized" cases per several million employees who were incapacitated.
A number that represents much less than a number expressing work in black.
According to UMP MEP Dominique Tiana, author of the June report on this issue, this figure would represent <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>15 billion missing in tax collection per year, i.e. more than the total amount of daily refunds and therefore infinitely more than the frauds associated with the latter.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new rescue plan
Greece will need a new bailout program to rebuild its economy.
On Monday, December 14, Prime Minister Lucas Papademos addressed parliament, adding that the 100 days of unity given to his government would not be enough to fulfill this task.
"To get our economy back on track, we need the support of our European partners and a new rescue budget plan," the prime minister said in his first public address at the start of a vote of confidence in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken on 27 October at the eurozone summit will be the "main task" of the new government, as our country's participation in the eurozone is at stake, he added.
As a result, Mr Papademos predicted that the country's public deficit would be "around 9%" of gross domestic product from now until the end of the year, after being 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rights Reject New Savings Measures
Right-wing leader Antonis Samaras on Monday voiced his support for measures already approved to try to escape the debt crisis, but warned that his party is not committed to any additional austerity measures.
"We will not raise our hands for any new measures," Samaras stressed at a meeting with MPs for his New Democracy party.
We have agreed on the objectives of reducing deficits and debt and combating waste, but we are against any policy that would prevent an economic recovery.
To Mr Ollim Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unblock the necessary <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8 billion loan without a written guarantee from all sides to support the envisaged measures, Antonis Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything more under pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalised, says expert commission
According to a report by the Royal Canadian Society, Canadians are denied death.
With regard to palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by the idea of denying death.
Only 9% of Canadians actually accept the opportunity to talk to a doctor about the conditions under which they want to die, and make decisions in that sense.
This is one of the conclusions of the extensive report of the Royal Canadian Society, which was attended by six experts working in various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
The commission recommends that the government amend the criminal law to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia if this choice appears necessary for a patient deemed competent to make such a decision.
At the beginning, experts cite a recent survey by the independent agency Economist Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
Although Canada ranked 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has given rise to a culture in which people are afraid to talk about death.”
Medicalization yes or no, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, experts with the mandate of the Royal Canadian Society tell us.
And despite the desire to die at home that most Canadians have, 68.6% of them die in hospital.
This average applies to all of Canada, while in the province of Quebec, this figure is highest with 86% of hospital deaths.
With regard to the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that go against the position of the federal government, which has already said that it does not want to change anything about the criminal law regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
According to experts who have also checked all countries where these approaches are legalized or not considered a criminal case, there is no evidence that this decriminalization causes any abuse in the application, i.e. in the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide of persons who are incompetent or disapproving.
On the contrary, Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, confirmed more than a number of cases of such concussions in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are not legalised.
"Euthanasia is also carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
“Assisted suicide is also being carried out in Canada, where it is clearly illegal,” Jocelyn Downie explains.
Canadians are in favour of euthanasia.
According to a 2010 survey conducted by the Angus Reid Forum, 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favour of euthanasia because they believe it will allow people at the end of their lives to ease their suffering.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean we are sending a message that the lives of the elderly or disabled are of lesser value.
In terms of people practising assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that they should not be prosecuted.
When it comes to maintaining or discontinuing patient care, the situation is less clear, the authors of the report say.
They also suggest in the list of their recommendations that criminal law states that withdrawal from treatment, for which there is a legally confirmed refusal, is not a criminal offence.
The Commission also requires professional doctors to be trained to respect the end-of-life refusal of treatment without fear of prosecution.
With regard to palliative care, the Commission urgently requires governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, including in cancer cases.
Finally, in the case of palliative or final silence already widely used in Canadian medical facilities, the Commission requires that it be considered as euthanasia when it no longer serves to reduce physical pain and to be subject to the same procedures.
The reservations of other experts
Some medical law experts have already expressed their reservations about the findings of the Royal Canadian Society’s expert report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in medical law, qualified the position of expert-signatories of the report as "extreme" among other things because it does not limit the practice of euthanasia to patients in the final stage.
"This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and who is over 18 could ask for help to commit suicide," said Pierre Deschamps, who studied the report's summary yesterday.
P. Deschamps also stresses that it seems that the authors of the report build the autonomy of the person above all other values that form the social fabric of society.
For "in society, he says, there are warning signs and restrictions".
Medical law specialist Margaret Somerville also expressed "strong objections to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified as a "manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is herself a member of the Royal Canadian Society, particularly doubts the dates of the report on the absence of error in some countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legalized, i.e. in the Netherlands and in the US state of Oregon.
Jordan's King Calls for President Assad's Resignation
Damascus talks about "conspiracy"
Syria is becoming more and more isolated.
The supporters of Bashar al-Assad demonstrated in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure intensified on Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who with the support of Russia resists them and speaks of a "conspiracy" against his country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria’s membership in the Arab League, the European Union has stepped up its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, have taken a stand in favor of President Assad’s departure.
Jordan's King Abdullah II was the first ruler of an Arab state to call on President Bashar al-Assad to "pass power" in Syria, where some 40 civilians and members of the regime's military forces were killed.
"If Bashar had his country's interests at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," King Abdullah said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu lamented that the efforts to mediate Turkey under the Syrian regime, which has been in business since the beginning of the year, had not been crowned with success.
"Those who do not live in peace with their people in the Middle East and cannot satisfy them will leave," he said, referring to neighbouring Syria, which Turkey is increasingly hard-liners against.
The United States was pleased with the "strengthening of consensus against Assad and the dishonest conduct of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the League of Arab States and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of Arab States, countries like Turkey are increasingly applying a harsher tone" to repression in Syria, Mark Toner, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, noted.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 16 civilians and 19 members of the pro-regime forces were killed in the southern Syrian city of Deraa during this time.
According to this NGO, two other civilians were killed "by shelling and concentrated shelling from heavy machine guns in the city of Jobar" in the Homs area.
However, at a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Mouallem estimated that the country had "come out of the crisis".
He also reacted to the League of Arab States' decision to suspend Damascus' membership, which he said was a "dangerous step".
Syria "will not bow", he added, with the assurance that "conspiracy against Syria will not succeed".
Following its decision to suspend Syria's membership, the League of Arab States is currently considering a "civilian protection mechanism" and plans to send 500 human rights defenders, journalists and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé is also sympathetic to the idea of sending U.N. monitors to help protect civilians from repression by the regime, which he said was "paranoid".
A new special meeting of the League is being convened tomorrow in Rabat to take a position on the plan for resolving the crisis, which was decided on 2 December and which specifically envisaged the withdrawal of the armies from the cities affected by the riots and the release of the imprisoned protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov called the Arab League's decision "wrong" yesterday, while China urged Syria to adopt a plan to resolve the crisis, while completely avoiding support for possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy (country)
Monti demands time and sacrifice for Italians
The next head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for some time to form his team and begin to implement a program that will include "victims" in order to regain the credibility lost in recent months by the government of Berlusconi.
Yesterday, the former European Commissioner discussed with political parties before today's meeting with representatives of trade unionists and employers.
It should build a relatively slim cabinet composed of technocrats not belonging to parliamentary parties.
"Monti spoke about an important programme with many victims," Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the numerous parliamentary groups participating in the talks, said after meeting with the designated prime minister.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini expects Mario Monti to ask parliament for a vote of confidence by Friday to ensure the new government has enough support.
The consultation will end with Mario Monti presenting a small team of 12 ministers to President Giorgio Napolitan.
Mario Monti commented yesterday on the nervousness in the financial markets and asked for time.
In "democracy, exact terms" apply when it comes to the preparation of the government and its program, he stressed, adding that he is "certain that the markets will be patient and understand".
His appointment as president was initially favourably received by the markets, but concerns resurfaced after an unexpected September collapse of industrial production in the eurozone.
The Prime Minister-designate should form a team consisting mainly of technocrats, although he stressed that he would like to adopt "politics" in it.
He expressed the belief that the new government will last until 2013, i.e. until the date of the next elections.
Gianfranco Fini, Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, said the new government would gain confidence in parliament by Friday.
After taking office, Mario Monti promised to act with extraordinary urgency and with the aim of making Italy "a strong member" of Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "even with the new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy does not change".
The European Union is convinced that, despite the austerity plans adopted in recent months, Rome will not achieve its objective of a balanced budget in 2013 and calls for new tough measures.
The head of the Confindustria business union, Emma Marcegagli, who meets Monti on Tuesday, has focused on the need to revive the economy "because a country that does not show growth can not comply with deficit parameters".
Mario Monti, former European Commissioner (1994-2004) recognized for his expertise and independence, "a professor" symbolising, according to the authors of the introductions, "the call to gravity" and "another Italy", represents for Italy "an epochal change" after 17 years of "berlusconism".
The length of his team's life will be unknown.
President Napolitano would like to avoid early elections, as Italy has until April 2012 to place state bonds worth 200 billion euros.
Soviet Scientist Helped Iran's Nuclear Program
The Soviet scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator for nuclear weapons, a U.S. non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risks announced on Tuesday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents leaked from the agency.
Last week, the IAEA said it was "seriously concerned" about the "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to the Institute of ISIS widely drawing from the documents of the IAEA, V. Danilenko (born 1934) should have worked for three decades since the sixties in the Soviet military research center in Chelyabinsk (Ural), where he was to deal with the production of synthetic diamonds by the method of explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he was to leave the center to set up a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
His company's economic troubles led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
Prior to his return to Russia, he was to cooperate on the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002.
In its latest report, the IAEA recalls "clear evidence that the development of Iran's detonation system" was "based on the work of a foreign specialist who not only knew this method well, but who - as one Member State informed the Agency - worked on this technology during a substantial part of his career in the military nuclear program".
Anti-Muslim Crimes and Crimes Increase by 50%
According to FBI statistics released on Monday, the number of crimes and misdemeanors targeting Muslims rose by nearly 50 percent from 2009 to 2010, while at the same time other racial and religious violence declined or rose slightly.
According to these figures, the total number of violence committed against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. a 49% increase over the 13% rate of violence against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% increase in total increases in anti-religious and criminal offences.
The total number of “hate crimes” rose very slightly to 6,628, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After the decline in 2009, it is disturbing to see these crimes and crimes rise again," Human Rights First said in a statement, adding that "the increase in anti-Muslim violence is particularly significant."
“Human Rights First has long stressed that violence against Muslims, as well as all forms of hate crime, must be considered a serious violation of human rights,” said Paul Legendre, a senior fellow at Human Rights First.
“The U.S. government can and must do more to address these abuses,” he added, adding that this could be done by improving police reports of “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law is a legacy of the civil rights struggle.
This legal order was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish the violence associated with race, skin color, religion, origin and now also sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing and becoming more like Facebook
The website that provides microblogging services Twitter introduced design changes on Monday to allow its users to observe the activity of followers, which somewhat resembles its services to Facebook.
The new "activity" and "name" offers allow you to better and directly know the activities of other people who follow you or the people whose replies ("tweets") you follow.
This lets you know if they allow you to watch posts, if they sign in to new accounts, if they have favorite posts, etc.
This new face of Twitter was tested "in August at a small percentage of users" before it was extended to the entire network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with terms somewhat incomprehensible (RT for the repeated dissemination of someone else's post, followfriday to recommend to follow another user) making the happiness of the initiates, thus opens up a wider audience Facebook with a more comparable handling and that of the Google+ network.
On the network, users immediately in their"tweets" differently assess the importance of this innovation.
“It’s unnecessary, it takes up a lot of space and it’s too much like Facebook,” @jemb123 writes.
“The Activity feature will help me better track some of the elements of my Twitter,” @dannykronstrom said.
Austria (country)
Writing the Golden Rule on a Balanced Budget into the Constitution
The government of a large coalition of social democrats and Christian democrats in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to sign the "golden rule" of budget policy into the constitution in order to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid any reduction in Austria's rating by rating agencies (AA).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision at the conclusion of the Council of Ministers in a situation where, with its 74.6% public debt, it is high above the criterion of a maximum of 60% set by the Maastricht Agreement, but much lower than the debts of countries such as Italy.
“If Austria’s solvency were to be reduced by just one degree from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay three billion euros more each year on interest,” argued Michael Spindelegger, a Christian Democrat.
Austria is thus following up on the request of the Eurozone Summit held in Brussels on 26 October 2011, where the Heads of State and Government strongly requested that by the end of 2012 the reduction of the public deficit and the achievement of the balance of public accounts be enshrined in the Constitution or in the Values Act.
The instrument adopted by the Austrian government is approaching the "German model", Germany was the first European country to adopt such a "rule".
By 2017, the public structural deficit will have to fall by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year, and starting in 2017, the public structural deficit of the federal state will not be allowed to exceed 0.35% of GDP each year, while federal countries, as well as municipalities, will have to report a balance sheet.
The aim is to bring public debt below the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty by 2020/21.
Strong yen
Noda threatens new intervention in foreign exchange markets
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese institutions would have to intervene again in the foreign exchange markets if they were only to continue strengthening.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find too much volatility" in the Yen exchange rate, explained the Senate Y. Noda.
On Tuesday, it only rose again to the historic values that forced the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo was selling yen for dollars to reduce the value of the Japanese currency, which only recently surpassed the record against the dollar valid since 1945.
But only since then has it steadily risen in support of the purchases of investors who consider it a “safe haven” in the uncertain times of the global economic slowdown and the European debt crisis.
The dollar again fell below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen bar to near the levels that prompted the latest intervention.
Prior to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth around 120 yen and the euro more than 160 yen.
This surge in Japanese currency is hurting island exports as it increases the price of Made in Japan products and reduces the value of Japanese companies’ revenues from abroad when they transfer them to their domestic currency.
"Japan is recovering" from the devastation caused by the March earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region in the northeast of the country, stressed Y. Noda, who fears that this exorcism of the yen will not kill yet in the egg of a fragile recovery.
The world’s third-largest economy recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5% from the previous quarter) for the first time in a year thanks to a survey of the growth of exports and consumption of disaster-laden households.
But the Prime Minister decided that the high value of the yen did not reflect the "national economy of Japan".
Japanese Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Japanese Central Bank (BoJ), which launched a two-day meeting of its political and monetary council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
But the institution’s deputy governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “appropriate measures” suggesting that no additional currency weakness could be expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting at the end of October, the Securities Institute increased its purchases of Treasury bills by 5,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>47 billion) and increased the ceiling to 55,000 billion yen (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>519 billion) of the amounts it devotes to purchases of various securities in order to flood with liquidity.
Eurozone:
Rates are rising, stock markets are failing
The risk of a debt crisis continues to undermine European indicators.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy and better growth figures in France and Germany, the rates of weakened countries continue to rise.
European stock markets, still concerned about the stability of the euro area, are now falling into negative expectations on Tuesday 15 November.
At 10 a.m. in Paris, the CAC 40 lost 1.4% to 3,064 points.
The Dax index in Frankfurt loses 0.4% and in London 0.1%.
“With new tensions surrounding the euro zone’s borrowing revenues in trouble, equity markets around the world continue to deliver only part of the recent gains.”
“Nervous investors are only too aware of the risk of infection,” said Terry Pratt, a broker at IG Markets.
The Tokyo stock market closed down by 0.7%, suffering from market participants’ concerns about Europe’s ability to cope with the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes on Europe and the exchange will only continue in a narrow corridor of variation until investors have evidence that the situation is stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This re-launching of uncertainty about the future of the euro zone is damaging the currency itself, which is continuing its decline on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lowest level since a month and a half ago.
In 10 hours, the European currency has a value of 1.3570 dollars, with a decrease of 0.4%.
According to brokers, the currency slumped after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s CDU party at its congress on Monday adopted a proposal suggesting the possibility of exiting the eurozone for countries in trouble without having to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far beyond the 6% limit
Interest rates on loans in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This morning on Tuesday, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reaches 6.85% and the yield of Spanish 10-year bonds is 6.2%.
These tensions, which affect the interest rates of southern European countries, but also in France, continue to raise market participants’ concerns.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has demanded time in the markets to correct the situation in Italy threatened by poisoning caused by the amount of her debt.
Greece’s new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, has confirmed that the implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 will be the “principal task” of his government.
Spain is once again in the intended line of the markets, when elections to the Chamber of Deputies are held in the country on Sunday.
The spread between the ten-year bonds of Germany and Spain reached a new historic high.
In anticipation of figures announcing the growth of the euro area
Statistics show that France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, mainly due to household consumption, i.e. slightly better than expected growth of 0.3%.
However, the French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE) revised down the figure for the second quarter to a decrease of 0.1% of GDP instead of stagnation.
This is the fourth quarter that has been the most worrying for economists.
For its part, Germany registered a growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first estimates for the entire euro area are expected at 11 a.m., while the European Commission has just warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy Policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas.
If there is a topic that cannot be grasped on the basis of short-term balances or under emotions, then it is energy policy.
The availability and price of electricity have a direct impact on the purchasing power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is natural that an election meeting should be an opportunity to think about such deposits and about a place that takes energy from the core.
The debate will be successful only if all the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options are examined.
The French must base their position on objective facts and rational data.
So far, there are 7 billion human beings on the planet, but demographic developments will double the demand for electricity by 2050 if we do not want to deprive a significant part of the world’s population of important parts of life.
At the same time, it will be necessary to face a shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to produce electricity, while not forgetting the necessary need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in order to combat climate change, which is a topic that is currently disappearing from environmentalists.
The accident in Fukushima does not affect any of these parameters.
And that is why Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
However, this is not the case for Belgium, which is subject to its decision to find some other source capable of replacing itself, nor for Switzerland, which considers it appropriate to build only the latest generation of power plants.
On the contrary, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to quote at least some countries, continue with determination in their projects.
After Fukushima, the United States decided to expand its park by one unit by rebuilding a single power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island power plant disaster.
If a German model based on renewable energies is sometimes presented as an example, reality contradicts it.
The choice of Berlin will be manifested by the price of electricity, increased energy dependence on gas imported especially from Russia, a sharp increase in CO2 emissions caused by the construction of natural gas and coal-fired power plants.
All these unpleasant effects will be felt within a few months.
The case of Denmark deserves to be considered.
The European champion in wind power plants, of which it receives 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest consumers of coal and gas due to the irregularity of the wind, due to which CO2 emissions and Danish electricity prices are higher by 65% and 50%, respectively, than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the immutability of our energy policy, our neighbours will pay 40% more electricity bills than the French households pay.
While in a globalised economy, energy costs are a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of maintaining industry on national territory, French companies enjoy the benefits of the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction in the share of nuclear energy would trigger a strong increase in the price of electricity, which would make illusory beautiful statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defense of purchasing power.
The price that the vast majority of French people refuse to pay, as well as do not fundamentally oppose this energy, as public opinion polls show.
Recall that our country’s energy policy has allowed to build an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 consecutive jobs.
The highly-exporting sector is attracting large numbers of small and medium-sized specialised jobs to international markets that cannot be transferred abroad.
If France decided to leave the core, it would sacrifice a small number of these small and medium-sized enterprises and lose the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion a year that the country receives for the export of nuclear facilities and services.
Which power plant owner would order a nuclear reactor designed to run for 60 years while its manufacturer is scheduled to fail?
In solving the energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no magic source for energy production, nor is there any diabolical one.
The development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable energy facilities by the French industrial group AREVA is a testament to the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is absolutely necessary to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have the State Nuclear Safety Authority, which conducts uncompromising and transparent oversight of existing nuclear power plants as well as the construction of a new plant in Flamanville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, have the idea of safety in the blood.
In fifty years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
The only one on Three Mile Island appeared under normal operating conditions and was left without human casualties and environmental consequences.
In Chernobyl, the drama caused the concept of the reactor and inexcusable human error.
In the case of Fukushima, some seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented scale that caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will take lessons from this accident just as it did from the two previous ones.
The result of this step and the cooperation between the French and German authorities dealing with nuclear safety, operators and constructors is that the EPR reactor represents a concept capable of resisting such phenomena.
While all those interested in building a nuclear power plant consider it, stopping its construction in Flamanville would be an excellent gift offered to AREVA’s and EDF’s competitors and paving the way for them to seize leadership positions in nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy solution for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotions, dogmas and machinations dominate the debate so crucial to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various angles – the squandering of police, courts and administrations subjected to the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with the status of “land of human rights”, which France boasts.
Recently, this was an administrative nuisance, the object of which was foreign students, which became topical when the Minister of the Interior (see the May 23 issue of Libération) declared that France “does not need foreign talents, masons and waitresses”.
But so far, it has rarely been analyzed from an economic perspective.
It must be said that there is a fairly broad agreement between the left and the right in this area.
To the right, Jacques Chirac declared in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem in a country with 2 million migrant workers" and on the left, Michel Rocard, when he said in 1990 that France "cannot accept all the misery of the world".
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, the fear of a horde of Polish installers invading French territory was shared right and left.
In both camps, immigrants are seen as a burden on the economy and French society.
The only difference lies in the degree of generosity that we are giving to immigrants.
In his program, Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande limits himself to banality when he states that joint development will allow us to solve our “migration problem”.
This idea of immigration as a burden and problem may apply in elections, but economically it is very expensive.
As the economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron recall in their recently published work, “Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future,” a broad consensus on migration exists among specialists, as well as a broad consensus on migration.
Restricting immigration is stunting growth and harming employment.
Concerns about the impact caused by migrants are based on the idea that these people can replace French workers, especially the less qualified, and create pressure to reduce their wages.
But experience shows that, in fact, immigrants are much more complements than substitutes for French employees by doing work in sectors with a shortage of employees.
Low-skilled immigrants in sectors that do not attract French workers, and those most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not enough to offer jobs.
Positive impact on wages
Just as a surgeon will have trouble working in a country where there is a shortage of anaesthesiologists, these additions between the French and migrants cause the arrivals of immigrants to have a positive impact on the salaries and employment of French employees.
Giovanni Peri calculated that the growth of migration movements by 1% will lead to a long-term increase in real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And it does not take into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (a high proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel laureates; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded immigrants).
Migrants are also net contributors to social systems in European countries, averaging 1% of the total budget.
The World Labor Organization estimates, for example, that in Germany one immigrant coming at the age of 30 will bring a net contribution (receipts minus expenses) of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>150,000 to public budgets for his entire life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy expressed his desire to make up for the lack of growth percentages "with precious teeth".
The aforementioned teeth used to deter immigrants had the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to think about European democracy
Democracy is a rare and also very fragile commodity.
The European continent should remember this, for although it was invented in Athens two thousand years ago, it experienced during the 20th century the tragedy of world wars, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the gulags, but also France in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some people might have believed that in order for democracy to triumph definitively over its enemies, it would be enough to make a choice and carry it out in the most direct way possible.
However, it has been known since Napoleon that it was easy to think.
The universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not a sufficient condition and can become an "instrument of oppression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, the organization of separation and control of power, education, enlightenment, social and economic solidarity, justice.
The crisis of Europe that we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it has been the same since the beginning of the crisis of politics and democracy.
Acknowledging the error of the Greek referendum of type yes-no will have in this direction the value of a double revelation: the revelation of the necessity of a great return to political power, but also the revelation of a disturbing sense of its impossibility, its inadequacy.
This ambivalence must be thought out in order to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of democratic politics have shifted today, and many of the Republican fighters are no longer shooting in the right direction.
We can’t get anything if we demand a series of national referendums held as needed and disorganized.
Bianco exposed to a European absolutist monarch or leaping with tied feet into the void of nationalist depths: what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not want a guillotine knife, but a common, full-fledged, peaceful and continuous exercise of choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal - we would not even know where to stop - because the crisis is in Europe.
After all, it is the whole of Europe that is leaning against the dictates of markets and rating agencies, which is suffering from its incapacity and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that is humiliated on the international stage.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing its sovereignty and with it each of its nations.
There is an urgent need to restore the governance of the European project of democratic sovereignty.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debts, get rid of market governments and prepare for the future by investing.
The way out of the crisis will involve decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, otherwise we would be in trouble.
After fighting this proposal of the Socialists and Jacques Delors for a long time, everyone today strongly demands a European economic government.
Budi<0xC5><0xBE>.
But to think of it without stronger political and democratic integration, and experienced as such citizens, would be a new folly and a new blind alley.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
In order to form a republic in France, it was necessary to be "republicans".
The revolution in the interests of this could not be enough.
This lesson continues to apply.
We need to build a Europe that is more economically integrated.
This can only be achieved by building a more politically democratic and genuinely democratic European sovereignty.
Let us become Europeans in order to build a Europe.
"Contactless" chip cards are spreading
In an optimistic atmosphere, the World Fair of Chip Cards will open on Tuesday in Villepinte near Paris.
According to the Eurosmart office, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with a microprocessor (bank cards, SIM-card phones) to more than 6 billion units.
The most load-bearing segment is the contactless technology segment, which allows you to pay in public transport or to make purchases just by approaching the card to the reader.
This year, 460 million chip cards are expected to be sold worldwide, up from 320 million sold a year earlier!
Their share is expected to rise further in 2012 (expected 580 million units) and reach approximately 10% of the total chip card market (6,925 million cards).
After having long been in the grip of APEC countries, Europe is gaining ground in contactless payments.
About 26 million Visa bank cards are already equipped with this feature and 75,000 payment terminals are accepting them.
In France, the beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards were issued.
But big business chains work for two.
This year, Carrefour issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards.
In order to include a higher speed level, it is necessary that from now on the banks equip their clients with them.
“Two large French companies have committed to systematically distributing contactless bank cards to their clients in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But this is only the first step towards the payment method of the future: a mobile phone.
The NFC (Near Field Communication) technology required to carry out transactions is currently only equipped with a small number of devices.
"They're late."
"But their real growth should happen in the next year."
“For 2012, we estimate their worldwide sales at 80 to 120 million units,” explains Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks are already preparing ahead.
Banka Crédit agricole yesterday announced the launch of a test conducted in Caen, which will last from December to June next year.
iPhone devices of about 200 clients and associates will be equipped with a case allowing contactless payments.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
The Société générale also announced yesterday that it is preparing to introduce an offer allowing its clients to pay by mobile phone without contact.
The terrorist front stretches from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long-standing suspicions that there are links between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Islamic Maghreb (AQMI) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect are confirmed.
On Sunday, the deputy foreign minister of Algeria Abdelkader Messahel even admitted that Algeria has "acquired certainty" about it from now on.
"The way both organizations operate and intelligence reports show that there is a great deal of cooperation between them," he said.
Paris seems to have similar analyses.
An investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January 2010 could help illuminate the connecting bridges.
After being abducted by AQMI members from a restaurant in Niamey, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory were to be killed the following day at the same time as several of their captors in an operation carried out by French special forces.
In the rubble after the attack, French and Nigerian investigators were supposed to find several phones with chips belonging to terrorists.
The terrorist axis
The analysis of the conducted calls leads to several people in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers: one leads to a Nigerian woman who has long lived in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria that is the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is said to be close to AQMI and the sect.
"It's progress, but we certainly need to wait for more convincing evidence before we start talking about operational cooperation between AQMI and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian investigator.
In recent months, this "support" has been more and more evident in the development and manifestations of Boko Haram or in its operational procedures, which since then include human casualties or increasingly complex explosive devices of the same design as the devices used by AQMI.
The international community led by Washington has since developed pressure on Nigeria to take into account the problems posed by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities have long considered the group to be a community of enlightened mystics of little interest.
A quick success
The Boko Haram sect was founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around the mosque, school and fundamentalist Mohammed Yusuf. Boko Haram, which in the language of haoussa means "Western education is a sin", approves the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, such a connection is a quick success.
The sect is politicized and requires strict adherence to Islamic sharia law, while its adherents launch a fight against the central government.
These people focus first on churches, bars, and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram supporters became extremely active and multiplied their attacks on police stations.
As usual, the government’s response remains the same.
The army surrounds the city and the result is 800 dead.
The founder of the sect Mohammed Yusuf is captured and killed in prison.
Since then, the group has been radicalizing and leaving its northern stronghold.
At Christmas 2010 he carried out an assassination attempt in Jos, killing 80 people, followed by another in the capital Abuja.
In June, it is again in Abuja, where Boko Haram attacks the police headquarters in its first suicide attack.
And in August, the UN’s local office will be the first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which should lead from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, from now on worries all security specialists.
Now that Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb has encircled Mali and the Iger and Somalis of the Al-Shabab movement are operating in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat to the continent.
Last week in Nigeria, in an interview with President Goodluck, Alain Juppé said that France is in a state of emergency and is ready to "transmit all information".
The World According to Presidential Candidates
On issues relating to China, Iran, or aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are suffocating in simplification and ignorance.
Can a crisis-weakened America manage the world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
When the presidential candidates are heard, the voters might think so.
For several days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others have been repeating loud statements and brief instructions on foreign policy, which has traditionally been a strong point for Republicans.
The often unsubstantiated slogans about China, Iran, or helping Israel flow between them.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race for the nomination of the Republican "Grand Old Party", threatened to impeach the Chinese in front of the World Trade Organization and accuse them of "manipulating their currency", a major theme in America exacerbated by the migration of entire parts of its industry towards the A.
Worse, if this has to include the start of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated vision of foreign policy, almost shook his head at a stance that “smooths” emotions.
He called for a tough but constructive dialogue with Beijing (President Obama’s current stance).
But Huntsman, who is in last place in the election estimates, remains inaudible.
The Image of President Reagan
Romney has also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to halt its nuclear program.
"If I am elected, I will imprison Iran," he said in a fanfare.
“If Obama is re-elected, they’ll have a bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing in his obligations to that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best-placed candidate, proves his embarrassing ignorance of documents.
Recently, he called for a sharp stance against China's military threat, as Beijing is "trying to develop nuclear capabilities" - apparently unaware of the fact that China has owned nuclear weapons since 1964!
Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants strikes against Iran, says he is ready to send the U.S. military to Mexico to fight drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists banned by Obama in 2009 is also recommended by Cain, Perry and fellow candidate Michele Bachmann.
They are all far away from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and yet won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama himself was an amateur and that he added water to his wine in the fight against terrorism.
They stress the failure of his naive dialogue with Iran, the hasty departure of the “boys” from Iraq, his excuses concerning Libya and thereby ascribe to him the label of weak
But the attack is not easy.
The population views President Obama’s national security policy, which was removed by Ben Ladin, rather positively.
He has no confidence in Iraq's military intervention, which has led to a stalemate.
And with the argument that America needs to be rebuilt economically in order to resurrect its leadership, Obama is knocking on the right spot.
Nord Stream, the new port of entry for Russian gas into Europe
The long-distance Nord Stream gas pipeline connecting Eastern Europe directly to Russia and running along the bottom of the Baltic Sea began to operate.
It must supply gas equivalent to 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate this event properly.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended last Tuesday’s inauguration of Nord Stream, a new gas pipeline that will connect Russia and Germany directly under the sea.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have jointly turned the control valve of the Russian gas inlet into the Western European grid.
With this new pipeline, 27.5 billion additional cubic meters of Russian gas will flow into Western Europe every year, the first pipeline of 1,224 km connecting the St. Petersburg region with the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
The second pipeline, to be completed at the end of 2012, will provide a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, equivalent to the total French consumption.
And it already reminds us of the possibility of building a third pipeline on the same route.
For Gazprom, the early completion of this huge construction is a victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries strongly protested against the project.
In fact, Nord Stream will allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany without being routed through the country by a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are losing some of their power: the possibility of pressuring Russia with threats to close its access to Western European markets is becoming more difficult for them.
Warsaw expressed this most strongly when it did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream with the "new German-Soviet pact", with the reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin during the occupation of Poland in 1939.
This means that this is a politically sensitive issue.
Western Europe, with its support for this Russian project, has gained greater certainty in its purchases.
But it is at the cost of weakening Europe’s energy, as the project has created rifts between Europeans from the east and west.
Just five years ago, Russia succeeded in advancing its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy Western states with high gas consumption, whose deposits are nearing their end.
"This pipeline is part of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that connects us organically," Fillon said at the opening ceremony of the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large-scale gas contracts are a matter of both political and economic importance.
All this explains the wide smiles of the leaders of Gazprom present in large numbers in Lubmin, the gas inlet.
The construction of this gas pipeline is also an important technical feat.
The undersea pipeline is made of steel fitted with a concrete shell to protect it from the anchors of seagoing vessels.
It lies at the bottom of the sea at an average depth of 200 m.
During its construction, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to the time of World War II.
“For safety reasons, almost a hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed,” said Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
There was also a need to increase measures to protect fauna and flora.
The pipe itself is a long metal snake weighing like 242 Eiffel Towers, which throughout its length is not interrupted by either valves or maintenance stations.
One control platform was to be built near Sweden, but the project leaders rejected it when the Swedes were only reluctant to see the Russian state-owned company permanently settling off their shores.
"In the event of a fault, we will stop the gas flow in less than 1 minute," says Jens M<0xC3><0xBC>ller.
In case of leakage, the gas contained in the gas pipeline escapes into the air.
But this case is considered unlikely by the builders, because the welds were designed to create a leak once every 100,000 years.
Control of the condition of the pipeline from the outside is carried out by a submarine robot drawn by the ship, while the interior of the pipeline is controlled by a device that circulates inside.
This cigar-shaped device with a diameter of 1 meter is inserted into the interior of the pipe and is pressurized with gas.
At the destination after three days of travel at a speed of 3 m/s, it will provide accurate information about possible deformations of metal parts.
The long-distance pipeline has been designed to work for fifty years without the slightest need for repair.
Circulation of gas is simply ensured by pressure.
The value of this pressure is 200 bar at the start and 100 bar at the finish.
Five companies joined forces to implement this project.
Gazprom, which holds a 51% stake, remains in the lead.
It was joined by German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch company Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
The five companies formed a joint venture called Nord Stream, which is responsible for the construction and operation of the pipeline.
The company is based in the city of Zug in Switzerland, where taxation is extremely advantageous.
Gazprom subsequently leased the company for five years under a contract, which can be renewed, all its gas transmission capacities.
"Gazprom will benefit from the total capacity, whatever the amount of gas actually transported," M<0xC3><0xBC>ller said.
Financing for the construction of the gas pipeline was provided by 30% of shareholders and 70% by bank loans.
The total cost of labor should reach 7.4 billion euros for both pipelines.
For the GDF Suez Group, the investment costs amounted to 240 million.
But minority shareholders are sure that their costs will be reimbursed, as only Gazprom takes the risk.
The pipeline exits the Baltic Sea in Lubmin on a sandy coast with pine forests.
Valves with a height of 4.5 meters form an outlet for gas.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and other characteristics of the incoming gas before it is transported to German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
When reaching full capacity, it will be 3 million per hour and in 2012 6 million.
Moleskine - branded notebook
The Italian company Moleskine, which was founded fifty years ago, wants to give again the joy of writing.
It brings the smell of adventure, hours spent writing in the candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily discernible by its black rectangular plates and its leaves sent white colors as if by time of aging.
Moleskine, as we know it today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a new design but distinguished notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant working for the company, is in charge of introducing a new product.
The notebook is inspired by the old production technique "moleskin" (skin imitation), which is used, for example, for finishing the surface of benches.
This type of notebook was highly appreciated by the writer and traveler.
"Moleskine has returned to the old and forgotten object, which was an icon of avant-garde artists until the 20th century," says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand's leader at Modo Modo.
Success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales rose 26% to settle at 12.7 million units last year.
The situation is a distant secret production from the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were made.
Moleskine crosses the Italian border and is exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to put together an artificial portrait of the buyer, since the notebook will interest businessmen as well as students or professionals.
The image of Moleskine’s notebook includes that its owners are people of cosmopolitan, cultured and open-mindedness.
The small Italian company, which initially had 12 employees, now has almost a hundred, and since 2008 has two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
He sends his notebooks to bookstores and through the chain of shops FNAC to small boutiques in the middle of cities where he was able to assert his identity.
“We have been following the spirit of the times and this need for new writing, despite the turbulent development of e-mails,” explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature accompanies the development of the Moleskine notebook: recently, the brand opened an exhibition called "Zach<0xC3><0xA1>zka", where architects or artists exhibit their notebook.
In August, on the occasion of the film festival in Locarno, she also presented new plates of a notebook reminiscent of a leopard.
Moleskine benefits from its success and this cultural aura and diversifys its products: bags, diaries, pencils, laptop cases ... The brand is expanding to a wide range of carriers.
A success that aroused envy: in the autumn of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by investment funds SG Capital Europe, today Syntegra Capital, writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is there such a high proportion of unemployed disabled workers?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
Today is the 15th week for the employment of disabled people.
Despite the voluntary public policy introduced in 2005, the percentage of unemployed people with disabilities is still twice as high as the average, i.e. 19% versus 9% for the entire population.
Is it depressing?
"No, underlines <0xC3><0x89>ric Blanchet, CEO of the Adapt Association, which organizes the Disability Employment Week."
"The progress made in 15 years is remarkable."
"At the time, the unemployment rate was not twice, but three times higher."
"Nevertheless, much remains to be done."
It has to be said that for unemployed disabled people, there are still numerous obstacles to their entry into employment.
These are older people: 37% are over 50 years old (17% on average).
They have a low qualification: 80% do not have a degree and out of 2.3 million university students there are only 10,000 people with disabilities.
And finally - long-term unemployment is very widespread: 53% for people with disabilities versus 38% on average.
In short, such are the criteria that make it particularly difficult to return to work and which constitute the "core of the problem", according to Christian Grapin, CEO of the Tremplin Association, which was founded in 1992 to help businesses hire disabled workers.
So much for objective braking.
It remains unspoken, ways of thinking that are certainly evolving, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the association IMS-Entreprendre pour la Cité found that the managers surveyed had "a low level of knowledge about people with disabilities" with "an exaggerated idea of people in a wheelchair and mental or mental disabilities".
As a result, private enterprises with more than 20 employees are still far from achieving the target of employing 6% of disabled workers set out in the 1987 law.
The last known figures, which come from 2008, indicate a level of 2.6%.
“We are now moving around 3%,” says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, which is responsible for collecting fees from businesses that do not comply with the law.
The proof is the number of "punished" enterprises, as well as the amounts paid, which decreased between 2007 and 2011 from 59,000 guilty enterprises to 46,000 (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on businesses," explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also demonstrates real awareness, especially in large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of enterprises with 20 to 49 employees employ disabled workers compared to 82% of enterprises with 100 to 199 employees.
Gambling: "What Happiness"
Before inviting French representatives (Bleus), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens on Tuesday evening (20:45) did not hide the pleasure that this friendly game will bring them.
We will not go so far as to write that there was a union between them, but the picture is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the podium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard simply and well reconciled.
Five months after the angry gesture of his attacker in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach spoke to his player only words of praise.
“I am very pleased with Eden and his progress, and with the fact that he loves his country.”
"I want to move forward," says the French Lille player.
As for the difference between his performances in club matches and the matches of the national team, "it is one and the same, it justifies itself."
"I've been in Lille all year, which is not the case with Belgium."
"I need to clean up my mark."
Hazard, who was booked against Romania on Thursday night for this match against France, comes to the stadium in Saint-Denis to finally "light up".
The term “joy” cannot be forgotten.
Play against Bleus, who he encouraged from the age of 7 and in their winning campaigns in 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan,” he says.
This necessarily contributes even more to the "special" character of this meeting.
More so, because"they are opposite Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We crossed at once."
"I can play against them, it's just a pleasure!"
Leekens also kindly reminded of "pride".
"Horseness" to win"fight - holiday".
"The pride" also states in the quality of"neighbors", that France a little more than a year after the trauma in the South African city of Knysna"again became a team of a very high level".
"Laurent Blanc has done a great job," he sighed.
Although Belgium will miss the next European Championship, the technical footballer would like to see himself in a plane with the French in the direction of... Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are going to be big," he said.
"We're building something right now, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You'll be aware of this for the next matches." Including against France.
Portugal is very self-confident
Portuguese coach Paulo Bento is opening with great optimism a barrage against Bosnia-Herzegovina (22:00) this Wednesday in Lisbon.
On the way there, both teams lacked realism.
"At the end of the 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no shadow of a doubt for him. The Portuguese national football team, with a helm since 2010, qualifies for Euro 2012.
Portugal is actually 90 minutes away from happiness.
There is only one match left and one opponent - Bosnia.
Aware of Friday's score (0-0) in the hell of Bosnian Zenice, it seems clear that nothing is won.
Portugal certainly had a lead of more than an hour, but were not able to give such a rare goal that it would have relieved him.
"It's a good result, but there's a risk in it because we didn't score a goal."
But at home at their amazing Stade de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced they will step in front of an audience that should create a hot boiler there, even though the match certainly seems to be "very even", says the optimist, but keenly considering Bento.
"We expect a very balanced game, but we are absolutely convinced that we can have a top," said the 24-year-old Portuguese coach.
“We still have a 50% chance of being at Euro 2012,” said Carlos Queiroz.
An indecisive Friday game in Bosnia forces Portugal to score and win.
An indecisive match may be enough for Bosniaks who also need to score.
“It’s a good result, but it carries a risk because we didn’t score a goal,” Bento said.
"We will play against a team that has great technical qualities and which has players with great individual qualities," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will be interested in developing maximum pressure on the Bosnian team right from the start so that "they don't have time to think."
A good idea, provided that this time it turns out to be realistic.
