It's really exciting.
She always takes good care of her old man.
How are you treated?
I have a great idea.
Tom belongs here.
Whatever it is, I didn't do it.
Tom stopped shaving his hair.
Do we have to help her?
Tom promised to help.
It's empty.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I want to stay alive.
Please don't tell anyone where I am.
Tom said this could happen.
That's gonna take time.
Why don't you go get him?
That's one of mine.
You look like you're studying.
I'm walking.
Tom was waiting at the gate.
I'll tell you what it is.
Did I talk to you?
Do you like the wheel?
He is a lover of bread.
I feel like a fool.
Tom doesn't give me enough help.
I'm not gonna use Tom.
Tom was fat.
What does that mean?
Tom told Mary he was happy.
We've only met once.
Thank you for letting me talk to Tom.
Let's quit them.
How much is it worth?
The water was all over our heads.
Tom pretended not to notice that Mary was watching him.
What do you usually do on Mondays?
Tom stopped walking back and forth.
Tom raised the flag.
Do you trust me, Tom?
Tom's not my father.
Tom's my neighbor.
Tom's already gone.
He probably still has it.
It looked beautiful.
We were in a hurry.
What's this?
No one knows this.
The drain was clogged.
Breakfast is from 7 to 9 p.m.
Tom came back last week.
They were all scared.
I've seen it before.
You made a good choice.
Nudists consider nudity to be normal.
We sat and waited.
I knew you'd like it.
I've been kidnapped.
I did him a favor.
Tom says he doesn't know anything about Boston.
That was fantastic.
You need a good woman.
Dan shared his racist views in public.
Do you know who I'm talking about?
It's mine, give it back to me.
The wolves herded the sheep.
This song has haunted me for years.
I'm working.
We'll make it.
Did Tom pay rent?
This gentleman is my acquaintance.
You're wrong, people.
Tom was productive.
Racists are fools.
Are you happy, Tom?
Have you ever shot a gun before?
I really like that tattoo.
Get a card for the pocket.
I don't want to turn myself in to the police.
You're mad at me, I can tell.
Let me give you some cash.
Can I call you back?
I feel lonely in the city.
What have they done so far?
Tom is childless.
I don't live in Boston.
They sued the government for damages.
No one trusts Tom.
The clock had a guarantee.
How about we meet tomorrow?
I should have known you'd be here.
When did the robbery happen?
Did you ask Tom why?
Tom heard his phone ring.
Tom did as Mary told him.
Show us where you found it.
I thought I'd never find him.
The competition for this job is huge.
I'm a little worried about her.
Tom is aware that he was not a good father, so he tries to redeem himself.
Tom can't pretend.
Tom said he wanted me to help him tomorrow afternoon.
Tom looked down.
I love honey.
I have to admit something.
The alcohol had an effect on him.
Dan decided to leave town.
You don't know anything.
Tom looked around.
They're pretty safe.
Tom's got a little wrinkles in his cheeks.
No one cares.
We'll help them tomorrow.
I would certainly have answered.
I have to help him.
He's being criticized.
You'll know when it's time.
You didn't give me a chance.
Tom plucked the mastic.
I really love your older sister.
Can you make sure Tom gets home?
Tom knows why Mary decided not to go on a picnic with John.
Don't be so hard on me.
I think you did it.
We're not made up of monkeys, we have a common ancestor.
Can I take Tom home?
Is there anything specific you want to see?
When do you usually eat?
I consulted with him.
Have you ever thought about quitting?
It lasted all night.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too much of a friar for me.
I'll do it if you don't mind.
Tom's right.
You're kind of rude.
Sounds like Tom.
No one's judging you.
Stop slandering Tom. Stop slandering Tom.
What could go wrong?
When do I get to Boston?
Tom was having breakfast later.
Are you helping him?
Are you two related?
He likes a ham with eggs.
Just put it on my account.
I'd rather go by subway than by train.
There's someone in my room.
Tom said he told you.
Can you handle that?
Tom's obviously a jerk.
I'll send you my bill.
I'm fat.
When was it built?
Keep your cigarettes dry.
How did this happen?
Should we call them?
Tom will be ready.
But I like it here.
Did he do his best?
Mary rewrote the film.
She has a beautiful handwriting.
Tom knew why Mary had hit John.
Tom wrote the report himself.
Are they buying like this?
It doesn't look very good.
Hey, can you give me that back?
That was personal.
I'd better go, too.
Excuse me for a moment.
Take off your hat.
The acting is very good.
Please, don't mumble.
I saw a ghost last night.
I'm in London.
I'm not going to be alone here.
He asked me to look at him.
We'd better not be in a storm like this.
It took me a long time to get rid of those ants.
Are we really going to have pizza this early in the morning?
Can you come back?
Tom and Mary spoke in French.
He's got a shave.
Who would want to hire him?
I didn't even know that Tom and Mary had been married before.
Do you want to sing?
You're lucky.
I have a cold every time I run my nose.
We've met several times.
No one likes soup.
The tree is green.
The surface of the moon is wrong.
I'm trying to explain this to you in a way that you'll understand.
Everyone is looking for happiness.
Did anyone else come into the room?
I don't know where you work.
There's just something in it.
Tom treated me awfully in high school.
Tom was wearing a hat on which the price still stood.
Tom promised to help.
They're all thieves.
We know why.
You don't really love Tom, do you?
It has to make a difference.
The ring is cursed.
We need to call for help.
That's what he wrote in the paper.
Tom said it was urgent.
I'd agree with that.
Tom would lend you money if he asked for it.
Tom is obedient, and even submissive.
Where did Tom go?
Mike said he'd come.
I'm just having a little fun.
I wanted to call you.
This isn't your home, Tom.
They're human.
Don't make a man with a mold.
She tried it herself.
Run! Run!
Is it paid for delivery?
I want reps.
Why are we meeting here?
The glass is easily broken.
Tom's bed is empty.
He's got a weak heart.
Did you buy those for me?
You haven't seen one, have you?
You'll never guess.
I think I'll be fine.
Mosquitoes transmit malaria.
You've been putting this off for too long.
I don't understand.
That's pathetic.
Let me tell you something else.
What about you and him?
Whatever you do, hurry up.
I think I know how to find him.
We're also taking checks.
Newspapers cost a dollar.
How did it get up there?
Tom drinks a lot of water.
There were eyewitnesses.
You got one.
The Macedonian language has four verb forms: pronounced, conditional, injunctive, and punctuated.
They haven't left yet.
How many sisters do you have?
The peaceful surface reflected her lines like a mirror.
I have three teenagers.
Tom smiled.
Tom's not very happy.
Can I talk to you, Tom?
These pants are right for me.
I don't have a gun.
I need permission.
We're the champions.
You scared Tom.
That's exactly right.
Shouldn't we be helping him?
Don't throw trash on the ground.
I remember when I met the Queen.
Tom's really rich.
I had to pay in cash.
Tom's a martyr now.
Tom looked angry.
What will the Japanese economy look like next year?
That's how I got into trouble.
What exactly happened to you?
How come you're not sleeping?
They give me advice.
Tom began to scream.
This tooth needs a filling.
I have to think about myself.
I was trying to find him.
Our yard is big.
It's a children's game.
Tom's not mad at you.
I'll be back in six and a half.
Tom took me to my mother's pussy.
I was only gone for an hour.
I'd be happy to help.
Is that what Tom thinks happened?
The show must go on.
Make a good standing scandal.
Tom asked Mary if she wanted to go for a walk.
Why did you have to?
Don't draw attention.
I almost passed out.
Pick your favorite stick.
Is this Jupiter or a bull?
He's not running out of gas.
Tom's a tramp.
Who's on your list?
He has a very strong alibi.
Look in the mirror, brother.
Let me out of here.
I'm glad you didn't do this to me.
Shall we wait for him here?
And the girl saw it.
I'm trying to give you a chance to do the right thing.
I want to help her.
When was the last time you brought flowers to Mary?
What don't you like?
Let's see what we're dealing with.
Tom wanted to give Mary something nice for her birthday.
I don't want ice cream.
I think Tom moved to Boston.
Can I come with you?
Tom seems pretty sleepy.
Tom spends a lot.
Only Tom can answer that question.
One of the things Tom complained about was the food.
Be careful not to get stuck in the muddy bar.
They both coughed.
The train went through a tunnel.
Tom's too sensitive.
Mary didn't wash the dishes.
We didn't wait for them.
Are meals included in the price?
That would follow.
Do you like tennis?
It's gonna be okay.
The sauna's here.
It can't be her.
Today is the day they will try to escape.
They're all crazy.
People are starting to notice Tom.
Tom's known Mary since kindergarten.
I'm at the north gate.
My answer is still confirmed.
I'm here to look for her.
It's all wrong.
Why do you work for them?
Your future begins today.
Tom was in a coma.
This is a good series.
Tom's already been questioned by the police.
No, I was home!
We're your neighbors.
I still can't believe Tom's gone.
I gave him an apple.
We'll see what we can do.
Tom wasn't involved.
Maybe Tom's playing chess with Mary right now.
Looks like you're right.
Don't talk about her.
How strange!
Is that why you don't want to help him?
It's Tom's turn to flush the room.
There are no survivors.
She was supposed to shut up.
I'm not like you!
"It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees." "Then why are you still alive?"
They smiled silently.
I won't forget that.
I wanted to stop Tom.
I stuck a slag on him.
Tom's not alone.
Tom needs to take a shower.
Take Tom with you.
It's happened before.
Who's the loser?
That'll do the job.
Tom didn't answer.
Moral values are important in our society.
Tom and Mary were young.
There were more than 100 people at the party.
This will cheer you up.
The king was especially agonizing to give speeches, because of the heavy speech mana.
She did not accept the invitation.
Tom looked surprised when I told him Mary wasn't here.
The bag is too heavy.
The weather forecast is flawed.
Don't look so upset.
The rebels tried in vain to sink the submarine.
Your Ph.D. must be written in English.
It's easier not to go to jail than to escape.
He's dressed up.
When are you studying?
Tom had a hard time swallowing his pills.
It is worth quoting a well-known passage in his essay.
Tom makes Mary happy.
Tom is inconsiderate.
Turn around.
Three missionaries were killed and eaten by manslayers.
We'll make a list.
Tom didn't seem too busy.
We'll get right on it.
Can't you hear me calling?
Go for a walk.
Don't overeat.
Just ask them to give it back to you.
Take out the stapler.
I have no plans for tomorrow.
Tom leaned forward to listen.
Why don't we go out together?
Tom didn't keep the promise he made to me.
Didn't you love the prize?
Look at the demon.
I'm glad you're happy.
You're being dishonest.
Why can't you go now?
You'll learn to appreciate your health when you get sick.
Look at the star that shines.
I don't know how to help him.
Get in touch.
Get him to admit it!
I don't know any of them.
She likes short skirts.
Can you explain why?
You can stay in here.
Shut up, Albert, your theory sucks.
Bankruptcy.
Everyone knows you hit Tom.
Can't you at least help me a little?
I like the school.
Call me if you need me.
I didn't ask them to come here.
Turn on the light.
When do you need to renew your passport?
Mary doesn't have the courage to face Tom directly.
My son's not a snob.
That's from Tom.
There's no height in his story.
The battle was short.
How retarded I am!
We discussed this.
Tom caught the ball.
Where's the nearest bench?
Let them call me.
A current heater heats the ceramic tiles from the floor of the bathroom.
Tom helped Mary.
I know you'll pay me back when you have the money.
Dan came to visit us yesterday.
Tom left you a message.
I have to go find them.
This task requires skill.
Are you willing to help them?
I'm getting sick of the war.
In the forest, monkeys came down from the bushes.
Let's forget it for now.
Due to the sudden death of his father, he abandoned his plans to live abroad.
You're getting data fast.
You can't give up.
Didn't he get it?
Hello, ladies.
I'll summarize the whole thing.
I don't know.
At first, I couldn't stand it.
His sleeve's stuck.
I didn't think you'd like Tom.
Even Tom doesn't know yet.
I'll stay here and help him.
Quietly!
I couldn't fight her.
Tom said he's not cold.
We're trying to help him.
They all left except for him.
Tom's here to protect me.
I didn't know you were playing chess.
It's getting dark.
The pipes are jammed.
I hurt you, didn't I?
Tom doesn't know how to drive.
You can't control me, Tom.
Don't die.
They were banging next to him.
Tom's not a vegetarian.
I think he's right.
We slept in a tent.
The kids are crying again.
Tom didn't do what he asked.
Tom mistakenly told everyone that I was dead.
I think we found one.
The deadline for reports is next Monday.
My baby likes to talk.
We just want to be loved.
I was beautiful.
Tom was brutally murdered.
I thoroughly investigated the situation.
Tom's just an ordinary man.
The dog's name is Ken.
I'm the one who's gonna help her, not you.
Most whales feed on plankton.
We have to get out of here now.
I'm ready to do that.
The water came to my knees.
Let's make a cake.
You need to help me find him.
I don't keep secrets from them.
I'm the crazy one.
Unfortunately, you'll have to release Tom.
Shame!
Don't get so excited.
She was very fond of concerts.
Invite them to join us.
Where should I park?
Does anyone care?
How are you to blame for that?
Tom had a beer from a bottle of wine.
I fell off the wheel.
Come in and sit down.
Do you share his interest in the book?
Do you mind?
When does it begin to present?
She sounds disappointed.
Tom's socks are torn apart.
Tom persuaded Mary to donate the money.
I've got him with me.
Wasn't your name Cookie the old dog?
I just bought a boat.
But he lied to her.
I'm not married yet.
Is the lake deep?
Tom's my assistant.
I suggested it.
You're weak.
Tom began to laugh.
This is Tom's school.
I'm not feeling very well today!
Tom didn't approve of the plan.
After I die, I want to be buried here.
I'm glad I'm done with that.
Did she ask for money?
Hold him!
We have to help them.
They don't know that.
Let's try this one.
It is a multi-stage process.
I have a little gift for him.
This is my plan.
You talk too much about Boston.
It's yours to ask, Tom.
Tom is not shy at all.
Tom ran down the hall.
You didn't tell me what was wrong.
Senf's really hot.
We advertise our products on TV.
I was kind.
Tom was a good man.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I had a few auditions, but I didn't get a job.
It happened almost 30 years ago.
Tom's too old to live alone.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone try to do that.
You've been a great mentor to me.
Tom listened to me.
I need to find a way to help them.
Does Tom know how to swim?
You got a match?
Tom's my age.
Gold is heavier than iron.
He hit me on the head.
Is there anyone in there?
Have you read this?
What if they say no?
Tom wants to sell his car.
I knew Tom would panic.
Tom was 30 years old.
She's gonna have to go a little further.
You should try this.
I expect a call from them.
They blocked him.
Tom is struggling.
Tom developed the map.
What is that smell?
Either way, he didn't get what he hoped for.
I just fired them.
This was fun.
I'm not happy here.
Was it so obvious?
Tom is seriously in need of help.
You have to stay as far away from him as possible.
Tom would understand.
We laughed at Tom.
You didn't know Tom was gay?
Tom got me a job.
I knew it was real.
Is that satisfactory?
Tom stretched out his hands.
There's nothing you and I wouldn't do.
He says the previous dentist told him he would remove his nicotine stains if he stopped smoking.
Don’t expect everyone to share your opinion.
That's what Tom suggested.
It's kind of wrong.
Tom's a smart guy.
Carrot powder is a mixture of several spices.
Yes, my angel.
Tom heard everything they said.
It's been a rough night for me.
Tom was driving around the city with his brake lifted off without noticing.
Yes, in any case.
You want camping?
Who broke the cup?
Who's gonna be there?
We didn't want to exclude Mary from the plan.
Are you planning on sitting here for a long time?
She teaches English to advanced students.
Tom looks suspicious.
Keep that to yourself.
You do now, don't you?
I'm pretty bloated.
I'm not an employee.
My old English teacher is probably turning into a grave now.
People often complain about how others treat them unfairly, and do not realize that their own behavior is undesirable.
He wears high heels to make it higher.
Do you like bowling?
I'm sorry, I think you dropped something.
All you have to do is talk to Tom.
I'm right.
I've been robbed three times this month.
Can I come?
Do you need a break?
I want to practice.
Tom owns a blue car.
Don't knock.
I came here with Tom.
Tom was completely humiliated.
Don't call me an asshole.
And what's that got to do with it?
We're finally meeting, Tom.
I bought him that book.
This house is not big enough for our family.
He gave up the idea.
I'm sure I sound funny.
It's nice and fresh.
Tom was celebrating.
You're so inept.
Did anyone hit Tom?
We have a rule here.
Tom made up his mind.
Tom won't be very effective.
It was such a beautiful day that we decided to go hiking.
I don't think we're welcome here.
Tom's been using inappropriate expressions.
Your coffee is full of energy!
Tom was a nice guy.
It’s a great thing for football.
Why did you ask me about that?
I thought he was there.
Did you feed the dog?
Sometimes I am afraid of the dark.
We're gonna miss you, Tom.
Tom works at NASA.
Tom is very good at writing.
Something very similar happened to me!
I'll make sure Tom writes his homework.
She no longer felt safe in her own home.
Tom already told me.
They have to fight the idea.
Tom's really upset.
Why did he go so suddenly?
We all see their behavior as negative.
I'm just surprised.
Don't go down there.
Whose composition is this?
Get away from her.
His eyes lit up with anger.
Why did you yell?
Well, I have news.
This is a good place to pitch a tent.
That was beautiful.
Let me stay.
Tom ran to help Mary.
It's possible Tom has cancer.
If we work as a team, we can achieve anything.
That's what you're gonna have to ask him.
He gave me his word.
If you're ready to go, we're ready.
I want you to keep your promise.
I don't think anyone needs me here.
I can't wait for him.
Tom is the smartest man I know.
"I want to travel." "Me too."
There are many birds in the forest.
Please let me stay.
Let's walk.
That's what he wanted to meet Tom.
You need to ask them for help.
I'll never tell you.
Tom might be richer than we thought he was.
I never meant to cheat on you.
What the hell was that all about?
I don't have that desire.
I called a few people.
The girl opened her eyes, saw the bear and ran to the window.
I know your sauce.
He apologized.
I can't find the address of the hotel.
Smoking is a suicide.
Hardwings, butterflies and cockroaches are insects.
I hope you find him.
Let's light the fire.
I wanted to get you this as soon as possible.
Which hat is yours?
I'll deal with Tom.
Tom rubbed his knee.
Where did the pins come from?
Can we talk upstairs?
It is made of leather.
I need to rest.
Can I have a look at the menu?
He's smart.
Tom took off his coat.
Can you come with us?
You'll never find her.
Tom showed up, and the crowd clapped.
I think it's Tom.
Tom worked very hard, but he failed.
The dogs are white.
Get him out of here.
I don't drink soda.
I want to find Tom.
He is also a writer.
I almost had a heart attack.
I recognize the typo.
Help me, Tom.
Find out where Tom is.
That was really touching.
Bring her in.
You're cooking a bowl of lightbulbs.
There were no other customers.
I'm not going what he wants me to be.
Dan was a very caring father.
Are you a vegetarian?
He took five sleeping pills.
Why are you lying?
Who taught you how to do that?
I've given up smoking cigarettes.
I know what it sounds like.
He didn’t seem to mind sitting alone.
I'm feeling a lot better already.
I gave them another chance.
It wasn't as hard as I thought it would be.
I'm hungry.
His failure taught me a good lesson.
I didn't want them to see me.
It's a pity that the concrete doesn't burn.
Why is Tom doing this?
Tom stopped all of a sudden.
My father brought me here when I was young.
What a mess you are.
Let go of the bottle.
I'll try to find Tom.
I knew I had to be silent.
I'm cold.
Tom's here early.
He was drying his wet clothes by the fire.
He is always very knowledgeable about English.
These are all basic skills.
Do you have blankets?
None of the pigs were killed.
She bought a loaf of bread.
Tom loved Mary, you know.
Is that the last lesson?
My hands are sticky.
What will happen next?
Put him in a mental hospital!
You should give them some space.
The car has four wheels.
Tom is passionate.
What happened is a rare occurrence.
Tom's packing his bags.
What's the use of that?
That's very useful.
Tom was vibrating his phone.
I decided to buy a new umbrella.
I'm not coming back.
I knew Tom very well.
Guess what I did last night.
The girl walked slowly.
Turns out you're unexpectedly eloquent.
Your prejudices save you a lot of time, you can form opinions without needing the facts.
That didn't go very well.
We have to try it.
I refuse to work.
I can't see them.
Tom wasn't having lunch.
There's someone behind her.
Since the note was written in French, I could not read it.
He was forced to do the job again.
I'm not giving up now.
The room is full.
I fired her.
Don't be silly.
I can't open the tehla.
This was Tom's idea.
I've decided to let you go back to work.
Tom couldn't resist.
Tom is still upset.
Do people really have to hate each other?
I didn't hear it.
Tom smiled at Mary.
That was the basic idea.
Can we call him now?
Tom thought.
I don't mind waiting here.
I was surprised when Tom offered to pay for everything.
The situation is hopeless.
I like your chain.
That's not a high priority.
Here, take this.
How much is it now?
You got it?
I couldn't help her.
Tom always got everything he wanted.
You're not gonna make it.
Tom cleaned his room.
You know I'd do anything for your red eyes.
I was ready for war.
Tom slipped on the ice.
I will never capitulate.
I hope you're ready for a challenge.
Tom likes that idea.
This is the first I’ve seen this spring.
You want to play?
Why did he fire us?
I was home last night.
The girl who works in the bakery is cute.
Do you think I know what's going on?
Tom seems to be having fun.
Tom's not very young.
There's phosphorus in our DNA.
Watch out!
Linda was suffering from nausea and suspected of being pregnant.
Let's go to Boston.
Pick me up at 2:30 from outside the main gate.
The meeting started over an hour ago.
She's a bitch.
I feel kind of sick.
I'll do what I know and do.
I've got money.
You can study here.
Tom wasn't told why Mary wasn't there.
Tom's got it right.
Tom threw the arrow.
They're not cockroaches.
I'm not safe here.
To my great regret, Mary came to the party in a promiscuous dress.
I'll tell you what you want.
I hope it's useful.
Don't mention anything about anything.
The worst kind of hangover is the emotional hangover.
Let's get serious.
Beekeepers remove the honeycomb to collect the honey.
I'm supposed to help them.
Don't turn your back on me.
I'll never forget him.
Tom won the fight.
You should have brought them here right away.
Tom lives abroad.
Do they work here?
Tom's eyes lit up when Mary stepped into the room.
I'm relaxed.
Could you help us at all?
Maybe it'll be a long time before you see me again.
He was sitting by the river.
My cat is hungry.
We need some tools.
Be ruthless.
That doesn't seem possible.
Thank you for helping him.
The girl greeted me with a smile.
There are many big cities in Brazil.
I haven’t solved that mystery yet.
Tom respected Mary.
Tom wants us to think he's richer than he really is.
Tom moved his toes.
You know me better than you think.
I can't stop thinking about them.
He has big problems.
It's not blue, it's purple.
Who were you with?
Tom went to Boston with Mary.
Lambs usually kill them before they're a year old, so they eat people.
Could you get the gun out of my leg?
I'd forgotten how smart you can be.
Can I see that one?
He's wasting his money, he's wasting his water.
We're not hiding anything.
I guess I just didn't mean it.
I'm not so sure.
Let's put an end to this.
I've told you a million times that you shouldn't exaggerate.
Are you really happy?
Ask her to explain.
Come on.
The book is heavy.
Why do we have to find her?
I'm just telling you to be careful.
Tom lies to me all the time.
The rooms in the hotel are obviously very bad at muffled sounds. I hear him in the next room chewing mastic!
Are you scared?
Please feed the cat.
We'll be fine.
Let's walk through the market!
Try to be optimistic.
Well, obviously you have romantic feelings for Tom.
I can't find the key.
Look at us.
I arrived in Tokyo two months ago.
Are you touching me?
Please, talk to me.
Angels protect us and guide us.
Why isn't Tom helping us?
The therapy didn’t help.
My grammar is weak.
Tom was available.
Tom's going to town.
I am interested in Japanese culture.
This is Jave.
Who saw me.
Tom's approaching.
Tom is the real hero.
Where did he come from?
Tom wanted to be able to tell Mary all about it.
I'm reading it now.
Tom had no choice but to leave.
It's done the job.
These goats are naughty.
Tom went fishing.
Tom didn't even think for a second to try to convince Mary to do it.
Let's go to the mall.
Let's celebrate.
I haven't played Monopoly since college.
Tom closed his closet.
Maybe we're relatives.
It's my fault I didn't call you.
Can I use this pen, please?
Tom washes his face every morning before breakfast.
Why are you asking?
It's not the other way around.
Tom's sleeping tight.
Be smart and don’t tell your kids about it.
It was frozen in front of her.
There are more exits.
Tom has always been a great protector of his children.
I asked him the same question.
We had to find a place to stay while our house was being renovated.
He gave me six linen cloths.
I'm safe.
Your eyebrows look strange.
That's why I can't help you.
I still haven’t found the time to write that report.
I can do without it.
There are people out there who want to hurt Tom.
I believe in miracles.
She's getting dressed.
Tom threatened to kill Mary.
Tom couldn't be stopped.
I love to walk along the river in the morning.
You have to let me go home.
Will you take it?
Talk to him.
Go get Tom a blanket.
The ingredients for this recipe are a bit expensive.
Save your strength.
How could this happen?
I asked them to unlock the door.
Get off.
We have to find him.
He used me.
What a pity.
Tom nodded.
I can't find the formula.
You're in power.
I'm 30 years old.
Wow, look at this.
You know, sometimes you need to hear it.
You know how to sneeze?
I have very little money.
Don't worry, we'll find him.
I'll use the dream.
And a sandwich?
I know what to learn.
Hand over the lineups.
It was a terrible sight.
Dan's knife was spilled with blood.
Who was Tom talking to?
Why was Tom in there?
Don't drink too much.
We'll follow her.
Everyone here loves you very much, Tom.
This afternoon we're going to eat cherry from Italy.
And Tom's from Boston.
It's a cruel bull.
I'll take Tom home.
I was gone for three weeks.
I'm stronger than you.
Who's on the shift today?
Tom and Mary moved to Boston.
He's drunk.
I need a sunscreen.
There's no reason to be afraid.
Tom was unsociable.
The evening suits me.
They traveled to the east.
Tom's pretty strong.
I can't stand that guy.
You're the owner.
Water is the source of life.
The ceramides that fell from the roof were torn apart.
Who is the owner of this property?
Mary and Kate are inseparable.
I helped him clean the tub.
Come by any time.
Tom would have thrown us out.
Tom wasn't ashamed.
I'm just finishing up the report.
Come on, hurry up, it's urgent.
You'd better go.
Tom pushed the way out.
I've got two cameras.
What did you find?
Dan admitted to Linda that she was a heavy drinker.
It's Tom's drawing.
The game is not over.
Tom put down his drink.
They stole my wallet on the bus.
Don't argue with me.
You seem to find it hard to understand what I'm trying to tell you.
I'm not here to help you.
Did anyone get hurt?
Tom and I are in love with each other.
It's really weird.
They paid me to paint Tom.
I know it wasn't her.
Tom heard Mary calling.
I couldn't believe this was really happening to me.
Amoebas are animals.
If you do that to me, I'll slit your throat.
Is Tom dying of cancer?
Tom goes swimming every day.
This doesn't mean Tom is dead.
Winds are created by the wind.
Get a clean glass from the closet.
This isn't a joke.
None of that matters.
Tom wanted to go to Boston, but his father wouldn't let him.
They say he's very rich.
I'll pay for myself.
I wouldn't mind helping them.
There's a chance they'll kill you.
I left him a message.
Is that all you saw?
That would be a disaster.
I like the way the French write their word for "bubble".
The lift can lift twenty tons of concrete.
You're beautiful.
I think it's too expensive without any help.
Is that what you want?
We're pretty good.
The pork is cut into cubes and fried.
Ask an expert.
I love traveling.
Love is the answer to everything.
I knew you couldn't hurt me.
I've loved you for a long time.
Dan arrived at Linda's apartment.
Tom had a hard time dealing with Mary.
Tom seemed to be trying to convince Mary to do something.
I want to get up and play.
That's kind of nice.
Tom wiped his forehead.
The book has not yet been translated into French.
Tom's here.
The gangsters extorted a large sum of money from the rich man.
No one ever comes here.
Actually, it's pretty boring.
You're biting your conscience, aren't you?
I asked for blood.
I need a minute.
The capital of France is Paris.
I wanted to tell you first.
Tom will explain it to you.
I should have asked you first.
Do you know where Tom got that scar on his chin?
Tom had a bruise on his arm.
Get a handkerchief, you're running your nose.
Tom went with Mary.
I just saw Tom.
Attention, please!
Tom repeated the question.
They were originally farmers.
You just have to trust me.
I just don't want you to do something you're gonna regret.
I'm upset.
Tom rarely comes out.
We've set up a tent.
I thought it wasn't gonna rain last night.
I'm glad you noticed.
Why don't you just ask him?
Tom found a good place to work.
Let's just say he stayed.
She has ten children.
Tom stopped me.
You look very handsome, Tom.
I'll take care of Tom.
I can't believe this is really happening to me.
Tom and Mary didn't talk to John.
Let's find out more about him.
When did that happen?
Now I'm pretty healthy again.
Tom was still wearing his pajamas and bathing suit when I came in on the left.
We've all read that.
Go this way.
You're backwards.
The sentence is not grammatically correct.
I can't convince Tom.
I can go.
He invited me to his wedding.
Do you have any more questions you'd like to ask me?
Tom was Mary’s first teacher.
In the middle of the city there is a fountain.
You have to help her.
The reader will quickly realize that my analysis is accurate and that its results are reliable.
I've tried.
A broken tree was blocking the way.
Don't interrupt Tom.
There were no blankets anymore.
Tom's got a fast car.
All my attempts have failed.
Mathematics is the best thing for him.
They were so happy together.
I thought you already found a place to stay.
Put your head on my shoulder.
Tom wouldn't like that.
Did you see the rainbow this morning?
Tom believes in strange things.
Tom likes to dance.
Tom told Mary that he saw John with Alice.
He hurt me and called me an asshole.
It's empty.
Did you find him?
We were passengers.
I think Tom's out of his mind.
Some fish know how to change their gender.
I can take it from her.
Bring some food.
Maybe it'll be hard.
I don't curse the kids.
You have to help him.
I thought maybe you could help.
I think they lied to you.
Tom ran to his car.
Tom's downstairs.
I don't understand why you want to do that.
It makes us work too hard.
Slow down.
He wants to be the groom at every wedding and the funeral of the deceased.
Tom's probably all right.
I believe in ghosts.
My dad's home.
Would you like to ride with us?
Why don't you wait a few days?
Tom was not surprised when he saw Mary with John.
Have a good night.
I told you the truth.
They offer free condoms.
Wet climate conditions are not characteristic of the peninsula.
Tom knew Mary would help him.
Tom's never there.
Please take care of yourself.
I'm sure I can find him.
Tom took out the pen.
Why should I care what you do?
Do you know any French songs?
My aunt asked me to buy her a music box from Italy.
You can't beat me.
Shall we arrest Tom?
How long should I take this medication?
I don't need a bed.
Give us a Facebook Like!
Did you buy us anything?
The answer was yes.
Lovers who are truly happy don’t write down their happiness.
I still don't know what to do.
Just get out of my way.
Please, show me more.
I need to paint my house.
We didn't create it.
The man you met at the station was my father.
I'm studying English.
What is usually the cause of the pain?
We are dependent on work.
The box is made of tin.
She dropped the test for a reason.
Trust her with your intuition.
He can't do that.
You didn't listen.
Tom is evil.
Try not to pay any attention to Tom.
Mix all the ingredients in the bowl.
There was a lot of sperm; there was a lot of sperm.
Tom's very annoying.
I was vaccinated against the flu.
Just try it.
I want to play too.
Tom was a piano teacher.
Tom was one-legged.
Are you interested in Tom?
Here it is.
I want to have a little chat with you about Tom.
Tom's not famous.
I'm sure Tom will know what's best.
We could talk about her.
I'll find you later.
What do you think of Boston?
I'm never a surfer.
I'll find something.
We ate turtle soup.
We can work in the open, if it's light.
I'm the only one here who knows where you hid Tom's valuables.
This cake is caloric.
I didn't vote for you.
I'm afraid of death.
Tom seemed a little disoriented.
It was effective.
Tom's alive.
I blame Tom.
We'll be able to sit you down soon.
Tom decided to go to Boston.
I've been told you know how to do this.
You're an expert.
What's not her name?
It's not an ordinary pen.
The water was hot.
Where's the phone?
They will pay us well.
Tom seemed distraught.
Tom says Mary should be happy.
I was in a car.
I'm not a helper.
Maybe I'll die tomorrow.
They're my friends.
What's the story?
So these are the strangest prisoners I've ever seen.
I spend most of the day here.
Shall we wait for her here?
If you come out so naked, you'll catch a cold.
Does it still hurt?
It was pretty funny.
I set it up.
I'm a member here.
Hey, what's going on?
Did you say anything to Tom?
Are they all busy?
They don’t want people to be independent.
I'm dying of thirst.
What kind of food do you want to cook?
I'll do it myself.
Allah knows.
Let's simplify this.
Tom got hurt.
Where were you last year?
Let's find out more about Tom.
I should go home.
Tom didn't resist.
We did a quiz today.
I'm dead serious.
Give me the wine.
All shops are closed.
You were white again!
Stop beating your dick.
Tom's done with the jars.
That didn't happen.
Be a man.
Unnecessarily dramatizing.
We believe in God.
We have to do whatever it takes to stop Tom.
There's only one way to solve this.
I'd better go.
I was the one who dug this hole.
I don't want to know.
Does Tom fit in with the co-workers?
It smells like cheese.
Guess what happened.
I'll give you some advice.
No matter what you do, always do your best.
Dan encouraged Linda to report the rape.
Tom is a responsible adult.
I can't call them at home.
You're a racist.
I've forgiven you already.
Why don't we just stay?
I didn't hurt Tom.
Maybe I wasn't clear.
Somehow, I still don’t believe it.
What's a shortcut?
Thank you again for coming.
They're baiting us.
The wounded soldier was barely walking.
The sun has just risen.
I actually know the answer to that question.
Why don't you hug me?
What's stopping Tom from doing that again?
Tom often makes movies.
I was beautiful.
I like Tom's low-key humor.
Light is repelled by water.
Tom's pushing the soup.
I'm not fucking with you.
You can ask Tom.
Tom examined the objects on the table.
The police put Dan in jail.
Go back to your seats.
Do you mind if I touch you?
You miss something?
Let a man sit and cry.
Do you intend to help him?
We walked among the trees.
Anyway, I'll do it.
I knew you'd be on Tom's side.
They couldn't avoid them.
We need to find them tonight.
It's too impressive.
It's my fault I didn't call them.
Pray to the Lord, not to His prophets.
Tom was acting like a knight.
We're even with him now.
We walk to school together.
You're so talented.
I need to fix this.
Where are you going?
I have lunch this afternoon.
I hate it when you fight.
I should have been more cultured.
Have fun, Tom.
It's still growing.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
This fits perfectly.
He was chasing his slug with a hose.
I'm sorry, but my answer is no.
I'll get it for you.
Tom wrote two books.
My advice is not to give Tom any gifts.
Tom was busy.
Tom lived right next to me when I was a kid.
Tom puts his hand around Mary.
She has short hair.
The crowd laughed.
I'll send her to stay with you.
Tom didn't buy it.
I don't have a Turkish keyboard.
I came here to study.
He went down the alley.
Should I make something up?
I have to put water in the radiator.
I'm going with Tom.
Tom and Mary will probably never see each other again.
Let's take a look.
He likes to drink wine.
My husband is a good man.
He has a lot of debt.
She knows the major cities.
What's under the cover?
No one wants to play with her.
Tom's got them all to drink.
Are you ready to go?
Tom seems to have gone crazy.
Tom approached them.
You think you can trick me?
My name is Ivan.
I thought Tom wouldn't want to go with us.
It can't be him.
Tom probably didn't want to say that.
Who needs rhetorical questions?
Mary was proud of her chastity.
The teacher taught.
I wasn't here.
The question is when.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
The waiter was rude.
That's not a good enough reason.
First of all, I have something I want to show you.
Why are they afraid?
I'm carrying my passport.
It was a masterpiece that they often talked about.
What was the question?
Science is not a fantasy.
Who's your boss?
Ask her when she'll be back.
I don't have a pen.
When should we start taking care of ourselves?
I thought about what Tom said.
Tom wants vanilla ice cream.
Aren't you ashamed to talk like that?
They concluded that the ship had sunk without further ado.
Did you buy the medicine?
Did he drink Tom?
I'm in pain at work.
The question is who will do it.
I'm going to Boston tomorrow.
They despise him.
Are they all happy?
I thought we'd sit here for a while and talk.
Forget about it, okay?
I need to call him.
You're acting weird.
That guy's pissing me off.
That's a reasonable compromise.
I'm sure Tom would love to see you.
I wasn't right at all.
Please, ask me anything.
Hey, what's up now?
I'm not ashamed.
Tom's under medical care.
Ask Tom where he is.
What do you look like?
Tom's a wunderkind.
He walks to school.
It’s beginning to dawn on us that we can’t ignore nature.
I don't understand why you don't want to help.
Tom seems very imaginative.
Now the question is what should we do.
When was the last time you talked to Tom?
He finished fourth out of 56 runners-up.
Don't knock.
Do you trust Tom now?
We haven't seen Tom.
When Tom was a child, he became obsessed with the girl who lives on the opposite side of the street.
I think I can.
Tom forgets.
That sounds really good.
Tom really likes Boston.
Tom irritated Mary's silence.
They'll be here soon.
Tom found what he was looking for.
I'll be in my chambers.
They didn't act fast.
I'm weak.
Braided wool sweater.
I've been chasing them for a long time.
Vampires live forever, unless someone kills them.
I wouldn't want to hang out with Tom.
They'll never welcome you to that club.
Tom was not born blind.
Are you looking for Tom?
Here's the bride!
I know my job.
Tom didn't show up.
Thank you for everything you have done for us.
I didn't know you lived in Boston.
They left me stranded.
The animals are in danger.
Tom made a suggestion.
Don't make me a liar, Tom.
Tom left the door open.
It's not that small.
Mary divorced her husband a few years ago.
Can we talk about them?
Tom was the first young man to break my heart.
Everyone turned to look at her.
Don't you dare ask them about it.
That can't be true.
Tom's ready.
We need to help them.
These are very immature.
Tom didn't answer right away.
He has a huge potential.
Dan's messages were scandalous.
We listened carefully so as not to miss a single word.
I already have plans for the weekend.
Why are you so worried tonight?
Tom fell backwards.
Exaggerating.
Please, let me finish.
Tom says it's not too late to make amends.
Is the house ready?
Tom's vicissitudes are raucous, and they get even better when he drinks a few beers.
You've got kind eyes.
You don't understand business.
Is this your bag or his?
Tom called to say he couldn't come to help.
Why do you hate us so much?
Yes, yes, it will be fixed... when the willow grows grapes.
Tom's an advisor.
Can I talk to you?
You insulted me by calling me an asshole.
Since when has there been a fire?
It's possible that Tom is lonely.
I never hate people; I let them hate themselves.
What happened to all that money?
Tom wants the same as you.
I didn't betray anything.
I was thinking about you yesterday.
I know where to look for them.
Tom wrote me a letter.
It is impossible for him to give up smoking.
My hair is falling out.
The big question that no one has found an answer, including me, despite thirty years of research on the female soul, is “What do women want?”
I tried to pretend I was something I wasn't.
The peasants reap the harvest.
Tom won't like it.
Tom and his friends went to the circus.
How deep is the failure?
I can work anywhere I want.
What's on the table?
Tom's not violent.
Don't talk about them like that.
We're not bad people, Tom.
Did you ask her to leave?
Keep your promises.
I've asked everywhere.
What was the object?
With every breakup, we taste death.
Tom was a fanatic.
Is it over your head?
Tom wants to talk.
Tom looks like he's ready to cry.
She looked around.
They're vegetarians.
Tom was furious.
Tom needed some advice.
My laser printer also knows how to scan images.
I'd like to go back to Boston.
They put him in jail.
How would you describe her?
Maybe Tom doesn't realize how valuable that picture is.
Everybody's up.
Money is not a criterion for success.
I want to know when your birthday is.
Guys, what are you talking about?
Hold my luck!
The concert ended with the national anthem.
We were looking for them.
Hey, where are you?
I'm not gonna move.
Wait a second.
I have something to do.
Your propaganda isn't interesting.
He ran as fast as he could.
I won.
Every nuance is lost in translation.
Tom had nothing else to say.
How would you help me?
Go find them.
I don't have a comment.
I think he's hiding something?
I hope there's plenty of air in here.
She was married to a man.
The wind has stopped.
Nothing's changed.
You don't have to wear anything nasty.
The old man died before he died.
I don't like this book.
Fortunately, I met him.
What would Tom be looking for?
The sun is a star among billions of others.
I got the melons.
Can someone help me?
We'll go in the afternoon.
I can't ask anyone to do that.
I need to get over Tom.
You can ask them yourself.
We want to be famous.
That's pretty normal.
Did you ask Google?
It's not spring yet.
I want to tell you about them.
Don't mind me, Tom.
How old is the TV?
The mystery is solved.
Tom was taken to the hospital.
I hated her.
I still have a lot to learn.
Drinking alcohol on the street or in a park is illegal in most parts of the United States.
Well, here's an explanation.
I want to hear more about Tom.
I hope that's exactly what happened to me.
Are you sure we shouldn't order first?
Anyone who can hear the butterflies laughing knows what the clouds taste like.
We played golf.
This is my grandmother.
Tom wanted to know where to go.
We need someone good.
I wouldn't lie to you.
Tom will obey.
Just find them.
I can't get over them.
They pulled a trigger to see who would go first.
I gave him a chance.
You've got a great job.
Tom didn't look at Mary.
There's no hope.
Iftar is not to be expected as commodities!
But if I were in Brazil, I'd be a lot more scared.
Have you worked as a bartender before?
Did you forget that again?
I don't like it at all.
I'm just out of work.
Where will this product be used?
I'm not a student.
I have the flu and I'm tired.
Mary had flowers in her hair.
Tom looked under the couch.
If the food gets cold, heat it in the microwave.
The stream is to the right of us.
Tom's not an old man.
This seems too simple.
I want my old life back.
Is that your package?
Dan gave Linda all the money he had saved.
I think it's time for you to go.
The guy's a thug.
Tom may have seen it.
Tom's a bit of a bitch.
Tom's very immature.
What's up?
How to find the volume of a cylinder?
He was a great musician.
Tom's not drunk, but he's been drinking.
I've been taken in by your company.
Tom, you have to get up.
Tom wants a payback.
Tom stabbed a fork in the plug.
Will I be replaced?
I need to get us some help.
You can count on us.
Tom found a new job.
Tom doesn't want to be my friend, he thinks he's too cool for me.
Whales are a kind of mammal.
Dan waved Matt over and forced him to apologize to Linda.
I totally get it.
Tom seems shocked.
Are they brothers?
"Did you like his music?" "No, but you?"
Thank you to everyone who came.
Tom said he doesn't want to eat at that restaurant.
He's getting ready to roll.
This will make our work much easier.
I think that's terrible.
What's on the desk?
Are you still jealous?
Why would he leave here?
He took over the business.
You don't even like fish.
I saw Tom do that.
Her mother speaks Italian to her.
I'm on vacation here.
He has wine.
His feelings were not reciprocated.
You're not that young anymore.
I love the rhythm of the funeral marches.
We're probably lying.
Tom ate his dinner.
If you're interested, tell me and I'll give you his number.
Tom knew he wouldn't be able to do much about it.
I like this.
Screw the sleeves.
I can't believe we really did this.
How many miles from here to Boston?
That's what I like about it.
Does it hurt a lot?
I just want to be able to support my family as well as myself.
I'm ready for the storm.
Tom poisoned Mary.
He developed feelings for her.
He was still there.
I have a lot of questions.
Who's in charge here?
I've heard a lot about you.
Tom might say something we don't want to hear.
Every nation has its own language.
I would never accept it.
It's gonna get colder.
What are you drinking?
As it came, so it went.
His legs were numb.
Tom picked up his keys.
It all stopped.
Maybe Tom's drunk.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.
We don't want any more accidents.
I'd like to go, too.
We don't need Tom anymore.
The importance of music is underestimated.
Can you show me the location on the map?
Tom is unstoppable.
What's your question?
Tom went to the angel.
Look ahead.
We've never done that before.
Here's what I think happened.
Does Tom bother you?
This is my latest review.
I haven't been well for two days.
The hose is a waste. It's too easy to roll.
We don't think so.
I think Tom's rich.
I must have made it up.
Tom doesn't know the difference between a slug and a donkey.
The police arrested her.
Take these.
We're expecting her.
The rain doesn’t come to mind.
I'll tell them to go now.
Tom wasn't supposed to marry Mary.
I got the assailant.
There was no soul in the city.
I think you know who I am.
I haven't seen you guys in a while.
I can do this all day.
That's not a problem.
Would you like to sit down?
Tom had doubts.
Tom was shooting Mary with a rotten egg.
We're all safe.
Okay, I get the idea.
Tell me the rest of the story.
Let me take over.
Tom may not be as busy as he says he is.
None of what happened here makes sense.
I set them up.
What are the symptoms of mushroom poisoning?
What are you doing here anyway?
Don't despair.
I want to watch porn with lesbians.
And who are you?
Tom wants Mary to take care of John writing his homework.
I can handle her.
Can you play that chord on the keyboard?
I'm not here to hurt you.
Shut up, please.
Tom's worried right now.
I have no feelings for her.
I guess I was expecting a little better.
I already do.
He wrote a letter to his mother.
They're different.
What did you write?
Tom pretended to be surprised.
It was impossible for the boy to cross the river.
Tom had arrived earlier than Mary.
The feeling was mutual.
We want to know about them.
They're delicious.
The old house has a certain charm.
This topic is taboo.
We barely made it.
Did they hire you?
Gas is leaking.
Tom could see that Mary was sending messages.
You'll feel better.
Tom was a little stunned.
Let's do this right.
In Hawaii, you can cruise all year round.
Tom was motivated.
Maybe you'll have to help us.
Most people think that computers will never be able to think.
What a coward I am.
Brother, you can't just approach a woman like that and drag her down - that counts as sexual harassment.
I decided to tell her that I loved her.
You have to find your supernatural power.
I'm the first.
I'm the only one who understands Tom.
You're losing.
We wrapped up the carpet.
Let's vote.
Tom's sitting down.
You can't do what you want.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
Shall I continue?
He was blowing a lot.
I'm a patient man.
It doesn't happen here.
It is better to be an optimist and a liar than to be a pessimist and be right.
The water was soggy.
I'm waiting for the traffic light to change.
The boy was silent.
The hull of the ship is divided into several watertight sections.
Given what you've been cooking, I'll be washing dishes.
Let's leave the topic.
Tom knows something he doesn't tell us.
When are you coming home?
They've been attacked.
You can't lose your temper.
He's got false eyelashes.
I won't wait forever.
There's only one more cookie.
Tom doesn't want to do that.
I'm working on it.
Did you hear the knocking?
I won't wait for them.
There's no need to be afraid.
"Are you mad at me?" "Oh, no!"
He's not the shy kid he used to be anymore.
You're counting?
Don't make a scene now.
What was Tom told?
We can help you find them.
I have to get him to help.
We have a lot to do.
Tom was never angry.
You're too smart for that.
It's very simple to understand.
Everywhere there were boys divided into groups. Some played jammies, some tiles, some with a ball. Others rode a wheel or rode wooden horseshoes.
Doubts destroy friendships.
I want to hold you.
The whole place was snowed in.
I worked for them.
There's not a lot of milk in the bottle yet.
We both have to go.
The pain that causes love is sweeter than any pleasure.
It's nice of you to buy Tom such a nice gift.
You have to go home.
Let's go this way.
I just had breakfast.
Let's stay married.
We're gonna find her.
You misjudged her.
Wait till I check the manual.
The energy comes from within.
No one believes them.
Tom didn't accept Mary's apology.
He shook his head.
We're screwed.
Get the seat back.
What's his purpose?
What's Tom wearing?
Don't expect mercy.
I just want my job back.
This is not normal.
Can we talk tomorrow?
Tom's getting angry.
I can't find the equation.
Listen to a concert.
Did Tom bribe Mary?
I don't know how it got there.
I'm not satisfied.
I think you can tell us where to find him.
I've never lied to you.
Please keep in touch.
Yeah, I'm mad.
Today it is less humid than yesterday.
It's hard to make new friends.
It is strange how people in tropical areas eat spicy food like curry.
When was the last time you had to remind me to do something?
Don't you have anything to do?
Tom had no family.
I can't tell who the baby loves, because it points to both.
That's not good enough for me.
I have to go home.
This is true love.
Can you look at me?
Although he is rich, he is not happy.
None of us will do anything to help you.
Tom caught a terrible cold.
I grow orchids in my greenhouse.
Where's the list?
I don't want to cook.
Let's go get Tom.
Tom said I shouldn't do this.
You're not my friend.
There's an old cherry tree in the garden.
Jim's never been abroad.
I turned off the TV.
That's a false lead.
Tom was struggling.
I said maybe it'll come back.
I need you to open the door for me.
I saw that.
Wait for him.
Nothing like this has happened before.
It was Tom.
I'm not judging you.
Someone's singing.
Do you know how to fix candles?
Go away.
I forgot his address.
You're having lunch?
I'll give her another chance.
Tom's been with me all morning.
Its underside has a slit on one side.
Let's eat something.
I'll be right out.
What is your analysis?
Tom's too busy to help.
I'm doing fine.
She can neither read nor write.
Tom, you hurt your leg.
Come on in.
Tom and I had a deal.
Everyone's waiting for you.
Is that all Tom does?
We've all noticed that.
You have very nice lips.
You're not a woman.
I don't think Tom's breathing anymore.
It's all over now.
No one came with me.
I know Tom's gonna get out of jail sometime.
The most expensive thing is the land.
Tom said you wanted water.
Tom made a list of things we need to do.
Tom's a popular guy.
Did you use my knife?
Milk is sour.
We ran out of food.
Is this about Tom?
Tom asked Mary to hire him.
Why are you objecting?
Sorry, I don't have a pencil.
Why doesn't anyone want to help him?
Destroy the temple.
I'll take this.
Tom was the first to ask the question.
I'll ask Tom to join you.
This is my husband's father, he's my father-in-law.
Tom didn’t know what to say next.
That would probably be a problem.
Figure out how much money we're going to need next year.
I lit a match in the dark.
How much does it cost there?
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary said they were on our side.
Do you get up at six o'clock?
Tom sat down again.
In which state is Boston located?
Tom is very strong.
Tom spends too much time in front of the computer.
That would be a tragedy.
While I had inflammation of the lungs, I just sneezed in my room, waiting to recover.
Don't thank me yet.
My cat is happy.
She gave it to him.
Tom was playing the piano.
I'm clean.
I ate a decent meal.
You're under oath.
Tom saw something.
I became a lawyer to help people.
You just heard.
Tom's got a headache.
Oh, no.
There's no one.
That's not recommended.
I agreed to help her.
Tom wants to give up.
He did his best.
He's a glutton.
First of all, let's talk about what Tom should do.
My mom's buying me a toy.
I'm not gonna take that chance.
This house is in need of repairs.
I'm thrilled, Tom.
Tom's a jerk.
Tom's not listening.
They immediately want everything you told them you'd give them.
Tom was writing stories.
There's just something in it.
I hope there were witnesses.
In many ways, men and women are quite different.
I go fishing every week.
What's the solution?
Is that necessary?
Tom's behind.
I'll never leave you.
He made it look easy.
You better ask them first.
Who gave you permission to do that?
The well is dry.
I thought I'd ask for their help.
You might want to call them.
Some people don't like it.
In accordance with our agreement, he stopped asking me personal questions.
What am I gonna do with this?
Is your dog barking at them?
I don't want a job in Boston.
I'll make you happy.
I really like German doughnuts.
We were 18 years old then.
I make $13 an hour.
It's dangerous to cross that desert.
I love broccoli, but I hate cauliflower.
I get upset when I see him with his girlfriend.
Tom's running.
Go on with it.
This is repulsive.
Tom's really busy.
Tom said he doesn't know what Mary wants him to buy.
I already said I don't know how to do that.
Is Tom hurt?
They got you drunk.
Tom began to complain.
I think you should choose her.
Be polite.
You're gorgeous.
Tom got lost in Boston.
We have to leave you.
Blow out the candles and imagine your wish.
Come on, open it.
Tom stared at Mary.
Tom was wearing a doucher.
Tom seems determined.
I'm glad you didn't call her.
Tom went to Boston to work.
Let me borrow that.
Dan pretended he didn't know Linda.
I was swimming in the river.
Are you ready yet?
How long has it been?
Don't burn.
Who caused the fire?
Your demands are unreasonable.
I'd like to see him, if possible.
That's probably a good thing.
Mary didn't wash the jars.
Tom's a prankster.
I felt so much worse.
Tom tried to stay calm.
I'm using that computer.
Tom used to be thin.
This is Tom, my assistant.
Have you arrived yet?
Just a glass of wine.
No one's texting me.
Tom's heart is broken.
How do they do that?
That's all I'm asking for.
There's so much to do.
You're a pessimist.
Tom is my problem.
Tom's mother told him not to speak with his full mouth.
They're all out of control.
Every customer has their own rights.
I'm only calling you to hear you.
Are you in a bad mood?
I don't know how they saw me.
I know Tom's address.
What have you been doing lately?
We won.
Tom says he's never been sick in his life.
Are you worried about her?
This is pain.
These are the only rules you need to remember.
I'll be right there.
Can I give you some friendly advice?
The statement is wrong: I go to the market because the car is broken.
Emily wrote the sentence.
This might hurt a little.
Who's Dan talking to?
They're calling us.
Did you buy this for me?
Tom doesn't invite him to parties often.
He doesn't look like his dad at all.
Tom's not too cold.
It was after midnight.
It's scandalous.
What happens if you get wet?
Did you change your shampoo?
Tom was looking around, waiting for something to happen.
They convinced me to quit smoking.
It's warm in here, you can take off your coat.
I don't think they followed me.
They have no defense.
He often helps others.
Tom is a pessimist.
You have the right to a phone call.
Skiing was actually a lot more fun than I had expected.
Tom was swimming in the pool.
We can't forget them.
Let's go home.
That's all for now.
Who's the little guy?
Who would do that?
I'll tell you a secret that will change your life.
Let's get that guy.
I'm doing my best.
I don't remember their debts.
I wouldn't want to get stuck.
Their friendship quickly grew into love.
Tom seems so lonely.
I'll stop.
I turned on the lamp.
Tom wasn't kidding.
Fill out the form.
I don't imagine the party that way, but how do you want it.
Do you think Tom would like to go with us?
Yoga comes from India.
Tom didn't fire Mary.
Tom soaked his toast in butter.
We have work to do.
I heard it like a snort.
Shall we call Tom?
Tom sent you here, didn't he?
Sunlight is the main source of vitamin D.
I'd like to be your boyfriend.
Tell me who you saw.
He lives there, on the ridge.
I'll accept anything.
It's not gonna be okay.
Dan never intended to leave Linda and the kids alone.
What are your favorite French wines?
Soon it will be Christmas.
You should feel flattered.
Unfortunately, this is an incorrect formulation of the question.
Tom seemed to be used to such problems.
You'll be all right.
Everything was so easy.
I'm sorry, but I spilled coffee on the muses.
He rarely went there.
Tom's a jerk.
Let's sing and dance.
After the war, the winners are always right, and the losers are the culprits.
Tom gave Mary a doll.
Translation of jokes is quite difficult, if at all it can be said that it is possible.
This was Arena Day.
I have bad news.
This doesn't help.
Overcome the weakness.
How many squats do you make a day?
I'm just gonna sit here.
Don't you have a random key?
Let's be realistic.
Lemon tea, please.
Tom's got nothing to do.
Maybe this will help you.
I hate him as much as you do.
I don't want to hear about her.
When he came and found me, his whole body was rooted in alcohol.
Tom's gone.
I'm a little thirsty.
How many categories are there?
What's your message?
This is hard.
I'm not going with Tom.
Was he one of them?
He's got a small bet.
I'll make sure we finish the project on time.
It's definitely Tom.
What's in that bottle?
The music is universal.
You squeeze too much when you shake hands.
What if we don't find them?
Don't let me come get you, Tom.
He won first place in the competition.
I just want you to come back to me.
Dan smoked marijuana with Linda.
Tom often goes for a walk before dinner.
Yesterday she stayed up late.
You're disgusting.
They all shut up.
What exactly happened between us?
You look sad, what's wrong?
He gave up on the plan.
It's not just guesswork.
How do we find them?
Maybe it's weird.
No one can be saved from death.
It's not gonna help you.
You gave Tom the list, didn't you?
I think we should call him.
Tom has been in trouble many times.
Somebody open the door.
Does this belong to you?
We all hated her.
I just want you back here in Boston.
“Democracy encourages freedom.
Why would anyone want to hurt Tom?
You will need a ticket to travel by bus.
We're very pleased.
Is that how much we need them?
He was depressed because of his health problems.
You know why Tom didn't come to the meeting this afternoon?
Tom has a pain in his ear.
Dan hit him on the forehead with a hammer.
Who gave you such an idea?
What was Tom doing?
You must be in the middle of the night.
It's not the right time now.
You don't have alcohol anymore.
When are you going?
I'd like to buy a sofa.
I didn't get an answer from her.
Let's put the tree here.
Let's do it.
Tom became famous.
The song stuck in my head.
Tom saw this.
The car jumped.
It's all over now.
I tried to get him to come.
What's on Tom's mind?
My mother’s advice would be superior to my friend’s.
We have not been saved from danger yet.
Tom's getting mad.
He waited ten minutes.
She was wearing a vest.
Dan is now looking for the police.
Tom asked for food.
Look, I can explain.
I saw him there.
Monday is the first day, Tuesday the second, and so on.
They're moving fast.
I need to see Tom right away.
Tom's waiting for you in the conference room.
What was that noise?
My ancestors are from Germany.
Tom cut the tape.
I got him.
I want to hear Tom's stories.
Tom saw even worse.
We know each other.
It's easy to make pasta.

I'll pay what I have to.

You're not gonna command me, man.
Did you ask him to leave?
Tom has three uncles.
What a beautiful sight!
Tom has a plan for everything.
Don't sit down.
Tom needs to relax.
I'm jealous of Tom.
What else did you expect?
I was hoping you'd be reasonable.
I'll get stronger.
This elephant is adored by young children.
Thank you very much, Tom.
This is hard for her.
Mary put on a lipstick.
She's got a picture.
He's swimming.
The flowers are blooming.
Come for a walk with me.
I promise you.
This is very nerve-wracking.
We need more American slang on Tatoeba, under urgent!
We're sorry.
Maybe Tom's gonna get scared, so he's gonna give up.
Is this place free?
Pay attention to this problem.
Don't thank me yet.
I want tea.
Under no circumstances would I want to get in trouble.
Doesn't anyone want to sit with you?
It would be really nice to be quiet.
Tom said Mary's making a bad impression.
Where's your gun?
Tom wants to do that.
It wasn't easy for us.
I was a passenger.
I'm flying out of school.
I often heard him play the tune of a trumpet.
The unsatisfied libido is what produces all art and literature.
This is really hard for them.
Tom's a fool.
I think Tom will be here in time.
Stick to the plan.
If you get hungry, there's food in the fridge.
Tom beat me.
It's complex.
Check to see if the gas is off.
Would you participate in this event?
There's almost no coffee left in the coffin.
We can wait.
Tom and I have written several books together.
Why are you so angry?
And I prefer coffee to tea.
I wasn't in a hurry.
Mosquitoes enjoy the company of humans.
I sleep on my feet.
I intend to use it.
Can you get a message to Tom?
He flirts so aggressively that women eventually run away from him.
Tom lit the curtain, quite by accident.
You talkin' Tom?
It's hard to understand self-harm if you've never felt the need to practice it.
This is going to hurt Tom.
I don't want to ruin everyone's evening.
The pressure is increasing.
Tom immediately answered Mary’s question.
It's a miracle you survived.
Tom's been driving that car for three years.
Can myrrh be used in food?
Tom knows the way.
Tom misjudged Mary.
I need an ashtray.
They're both drunk.
Can you give them a call?
Tom began to dream.
Who would wear that?
This looks like silk.
Tom salted his salad.
Tom's the leader.
Save him, Tom.
You haven't solved the problem, have you?
I'll call her tomorrow.
I'm not comfortable talking about them.
We're busy now.
I don't want to tell Tom that.
I've already read it.
Would you put this in the car for me?
I'm a tree.
They have no choice.
No one's gonna find me.
Tom's very upset.
In what situations would you use it?
Can't we start from the beginning?
Unfortunately, you'll have to do this without anyone else's help.
We're all in danger.
Tom won't like it.
I'll give Tom whatever he needs.
Tom's excited.
Take Tom's gun.
Look back.
Tom hasn't been back in three years.
I'm giving you one last chance.
Are you into some kind of sport?
Tom, meet your new nanny.
He's afraid of getting lung cancer.
I've got a lot of studio.
Tom played the piano for three hours non-stop.
I got quality.
Did you find someone to look after the child?
I'm quiet.
He was chasing the thief.
It was an extraordinary experience.
Tom nodded in a voice.
Does it matter which one I choose?
What did you want to talk to me about?
Do you intend to help me?
The current government has a lot of problems.
Tom didn't kill anyone.
There's nothing to say.
That'd be good.
It's a short walk.
Tom's very scrawny.
That's what I said.
Tom has a butler.
Dan got Linda out safely.
They're my cousins.
It's eleven o'clock.
I'm gay.
Tom thought about it.
We shouldn't have let her go.
The man is wrong.
I can't wait to find out what kind of gift Tom has prepared for me.
I've seen it myself.
I love all my children equally.
I'm not gonna do what you're asking me to do.
Tom seems a little nervous.
What do you know?
Whose picture is this?
There's no substitute.
The hypochondriac invents diseases where there are none.

I slept on the bus.
Water from the rain evaporates when it is warm.
Ask him to wait until I get there.
Her son is a genius.
I've lost my flashlight.
It looks very well written.
That was the whole point.
Tom's probably still in school.
I never say anything, even though it annoys me.
You're below his level.
It's my job to hurt.
Is that why I'm here?
Why don't you just call them?
It's possible that Tom hired Mary, but I don't know for sure.
I owe it to Tom for this.
Tom is very childish.
I don't want to disappoint her.
When are you going back to Boston?
Where was Tom born?
You have to hurry to catch the last train.
Please, ventilate the room.
Tom is still trying to persuade Mary to take up the job.
How much of our body is water?
I don't speak French as well as you think.
That's very clever.
Please, help me wait for Tom.
You're very smart.
I didn't see anyone on the street.
Don't stay longer than five minutes.
As time went on, the radioactivity decreased.
Should we believe that?
What's gotten you so far?
I think I know how to stop it from happening again.
I don't have to convince him.
Tom sits behind Mary at the French class.
How can you help her?
Tom was lured into a trap.
I'll turn them around.
It always happens the same way.
Thanks to chemistry, we have plastic.
What brought you here?
I need new speakers for my computer.
You're a fag.
What are you up to?
Why are you angry with me?
I can't read without glasses.
I don't mind helping.
Nobody did anything else.
I'm sorry I'm falling like this.
Books are new.
Thank you for inviting us.
Tom wiped the jars.
That was rejected.
I'm not sleepy anymore.
Tom made a good point.
You must be worried.
I carried him.
That gave me an idea.
The watch's spring is broken.
I was wondering about him.
Tom says Mary likes you.
Come on, everybody, follow me.
This is a good place to park.
I go to Boston all the time.
Tom's not very old.
I thought I'd never find Tom.
I want something new.
The kids need love.
That's his job.
I wish I had my camera with me.
It's gonna be worth it.
We should give him some time.
Tom didn't hurt Mary.
You should do it somewhere else.
You scared me.
How's your new job?
I hope you like what I gave you.
I believe anything can happen.
You should eat less red meat.
You've got to watch the kid.
Is that what you did to them?
I'm sure you'll be fine.
This is already a problem.
Tom grabs a gun.
Tom closed the doors.
I think the box is empty.
I'm a little sick.
Who made the box?
You must be strong.
It's delicious.
Let's get some sleep.
You can sleep here.
Talking to him always makes me happy.
I hear they pay pretty well.
Tom was a funny guy.
Did you buy something to eat?
Boston is a great city.
Look at me.
How many liters of oil does it collect in a barrel?
Eat slowly.
There may be another world.
We don't have anything you want.
The pear is green.
Tom regrets what he told Mary.
Go find him.
He's in the basement.
Tom sneezed.
I get it.
Why didn't you tell me Tom wasn't Canadian?
I'll scream.
I just heard from them.
Tom's conscious.
Tom's got his hair cut.
They're all sitting down.
He touched her gently.
Maybe we should turn around and come back.
I don't like to walk.
She looks a little young to get married.
I hate school.
How was the audition?
If it's not broken, don't fix it.
I knew you didn't have a date.
We're just getting started.
His brother is patient with him.
No one could prove anything.
What hobbies do you have?
So I'm serious.
Prohibited speaking during the test, folks.
You had to.
Donate as much as you want to donate.
Tom didn't see Mary do that.
I always thought you were from Boston.
Shall I give a sign?
You're gonna have to talk to Tom about what you expect him to do.
Let's take a short break.
I let you catch me.
You should write a letter of thanks to Tom.
They're not coming tomorrow.
Please, find him.
Tom's back in Boston.
The light faded.
Let's go!
What if Tom refuses?
I changed my shirt.
I can't wait to meet him.
Tom said he wants to eat breakfast in bed.
Dan is walking his little dog.
It had to be done.
I turned the lamp on.
Tom wanted Mary to invite John and Alice to dinner.
I'm not sure that's what it was.
You're the problem.
Tom used to hate Boston.
Tom confirmed Mary's statement.
That's very close.
We took care of you.
Experience is not inherited – everyone gets their own.
I want to believe that Tom was happy.
The fabric grows a lot when it is washed.
Truth is a goal, not a destination.
I blame him.
Did you hear about him?
Tom began to speak.
I ran away from class.
Tom is still tied up.
Have you ever read this?
Without bait, it will be difficult for me to catch fish.
Tom was asleep.
I think she's good at dancing.
Unfortunately, the system is corrupt.
I used to hate you.
Public opinion is important.
Alcohol reduces the inhibitions.
Tom needs both of these.
I'll tell him to go now.
Tom seems confused.
No one wants to touch this.
Tom says he saw something else.
Her pupils were black and deep as an abyss.
Tom tried to talk, but he couldn't.
Take her with us.
I think Tom's fat.
I think Tom's hurt.
Tom wanted Mary to help him a little more with the kids.
They all have drinks.
Tom picked up the box.
He is a strong critic.
I cured my cold with this medicine.
Are you sure you haven't forgotten something?
We played basketball in the gym.
Call them.
I'm letting you catch me.
Turn on the radio, please.
Is Tom with you now?
This is a very good place.
I've got a lot to do.
I came to take care of you.
Tom had to skip the morning swim, because it was cold weather.
You don't have to.
I just wanted to clear up the situation.
Tom is wearing new shoes.
I'll call you.
You can't get to Tom's house this way.
I'd like to talk to Tom.
Tom lives a simple life far away in the Himalayas.
Tom's out.
Please repeat.
You're very dramatic.
Tom nodded.
Tom didn't even know Mary was gone.
She had gone to school.
It is said that Marie Antoinette was responsible for the French Revolution.
My family starts where yours ends.
He's my partner.
That's strong.
Why didn't you buy more than one?
We've been working hard.
But it's strong!
We're like brothers.
Let me cook you something.
You've got too much work to do.
Could it be Tom?
I have to call her.
I had to let Tom win.
Tom sounds sad.
I admire your courage.
He was elected mayor of Boston.
The police found shoe prints at the scene of the crime.
I asked him the same thing.
I'm pretty hungry!
Why don't you go find them?
Tom keeps the letter.
Tom would like that.
She ran out of half-naked.
I said we're closed.
The question is who will tell him.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
Tom should not be allowed to resign.
I use it every day.
It's yours.
Can we come too?
The more I eat, the more my appetite grows.
What are you gonna give him?
Is that sarcasm?
Tom's a whirlwind.
I'm gonna have to try and deal with this alone.
They probed the spaceship.
Tom wrote me more than thirty messages yesterday.
Are you sure this isn't diamonds?
You let Tom escape.
What's the answer?
Did I say I'm done?
Tom doesn't like girls wearing high heels.
Dream that you know.
I looked at her.
A large crowd gathered.
Is this a good time to talk?
I'm worried about your health.
I think you've lived in the jungle too long.
The weather in April is inconstant.
Get your hands off Tom.
Are you crazy, people?
I'm warm.
Tom was the boss.
Can you give him a minute?
We laughed at them.
That's how I like it.
Would you do me a favor?
This is between me and Tom.
I am irreplaceable.
Give him a second chance.
I cut the sandwich in half.
Can I see you later?
Tom's feet were cold.
The boys and girls are reading.
Tom has two children.
In short, it's your fault.
I'm surprised to see you here.
Tom despised Mary.
Tom ran into the wind.
I met your girlfriend.
You're my luck.
Take Tom's advice.
Tom left an uneaten food on the plate.
Tom changed direction.
There's no living person in the classroom.
The rocket is flying.
We laughed.
Tom was a little confused.
Tom only came to visit.
Where do we start?
I know you're a spy.
I wish you a happy journey.
Go back to your seat.
Tom's been scrutinized.
Tom tries to make her look busy so that Mary doesn't ask him to help her.
I rarely eat meat.
I'm gonna go ask her.
I'm keeping his seat.
Tom couldn't help it.
I'll call her later.
The flowers bloom quickly after you cut them off.
I called them yesterday.
I'm carrying a bag of rice.
I can do that for them.
Tom doesn't write well.
I ate late yesterday.
I just don't like it.
Plus, I know how to fly.
Our money's been wasted.
There was hatred between them.
There's nothing to see here, let's go.
Does that sound stupid?
You wouldn't want to be late.
I really want to help him.
We're friends with him.
I may admire others, but I’ve never really been anything other than what I am.
Sometimes it’s hard to tell if Tom is happy or not.
This doesn't make me hot.
I'll read it to you.
Let's go inside and talk.
Can you imagine a wish?
Sometimes children are afraid of the dark.
Stay out of it.
I had to stay.
Tom's the only one here who doesn't understand French.
Tom asked Mary for money.
Who bought you this?
Tom's gonna get you.
My bags are packed.
Tom's back.
Cube of hair.
This is the best restaurant in the area.
That's what I liked.
He crossed the street.
As long as there is life, there is hope.
I heard them barking.
Too bad I didn't ride a bike here.
I have to visit Tom.
What makes you uncomfortable?
Do you still need a babysitter for Monday night?
I don't wear provocative clothes.
This is classified.
That's not so much.
That's what you said an hour ago.
I don't want to die.
Goddamn it!
I'd rather walk alone.
How many herbs did you buy?
Come back as soon as you can.
Mr. Jackson, your son died of an overdose.
Nothing can stop us.
He's not in the mood.
What did you get?
I motivated you.
I don't want to shadow you.
I didn't see where you put your car keys.
Are you sure you don't want to consider another option?
He didn't even give them a chance.
He suddenly showed up.
I'll do as you say.
It's a long story.
Tom's gonna be great.
Tom was kind to all of Mary's friends.
That would be fun.
He trades in semi-trailers.
Appreciate the thought.
I'm not leaving.
You know that?
You did a bad job.
Tom's cold.
Emily's a teenager.
They think it's too much.
Who was the thief?
He has a charm.
The question is who decides what to do.
Tom's not gonna catch me.
You're absolutely right.
My voice on the tape doesn't sound like my natural voice.
I told you this was gonna get boring.
I didn't know if I should be angry or laugh.
I'm mad at you.
We waited.
Tom got up at seven o'clock.
I've always loved a dog.
You're perfectly safe.
Tom seems to have everything he needs.
The question is, will he come to visit us next month?
The marionettes run them on wires.
I don't want to talk about time.
I'm not as fast as you.
The other girls teased her because of her clothes.
You're gonna get confused.
I'm not following you.
Maybe Tom already did what he was supposed to do.
I'll give them another chance.
He just called me.
The failure stifled him.
How are you these days, Tom?
I can't stand to see him.
Some people are afraid of spiders.
Even she doesn't understand me.
Beekeepers believe that genetically modified plants are harmful to bees' health.
You can go now.
They procrastinate.
Tom's a second year.
If I can understand, then anyone can.
The tourists were not satisfied.
Tom's got his socks on.
I'll check the list.
Didn't I tell you not to do that?
Tom pelts.
Laws are like spiders - they hunt flies, but let the wasps and vertebrae break through.
You're proud of the peacock.
When did Tom go to Boston?
He left his key on the desk, as he always did.
He took off his fur coat, climbed up, and patted the door gently.
Tom looks so happy.
We don't look the same on the subject, but I'm not the one who's wrong.
Something was wrong with Tom.
You love your life, don't you?
Your desserts are tempting, but we're full.
We've been looking for you.
You're my neighbor.
I'm willing to help.
We're leaving Boston.
I'll wait in the gym.
Tom doesn't like tennis.
How long has Tom been here?
He's texting his boyfriend.
Has anyone seen Tom?
He avoided the danger.
What did I tell you?
How many times do I have to repeat that?
I think you're spending too much time with Tom.
Tom is desperate.
You sound like you're relieved.
Tom is unforgettable.
Kyoto is a beautiful city.
The handle doesn't turn.
I think you're right.
It's all very strange.
I'm writing my will.
"Why did you break my vase?" "Good for you."
We were very close.
I'm sweating every day.
Give me your knife.
No one is defending my country.
Tom never gave up.
I asked her not to interfere.
Tomorrow is not a big day.
Tom's a drug addict.
We weren't hungry.
This is amazing.
Wait for me to take a breath.
What do you know about cloning?
Where's my wallet? It doesn't matter! I just found it under the couch.
Now he's watching TV.
What happened here?
Why is Tom crying?
It's a coincidence.
I'm so glad I'm home.
Can we just stop?
I guess that's okay.
You can shackle me, torture me, and even destroy my body, but you'll never capture my mind.
It's poison.
I need to know who helped her.
It happens all the time.
I wish I could be as happy as you are.
Try the jumper.
The cat stuck its claws in my hand.
"When did you sleep last night?" "At four o'clock." "What? What were you doing so late?" "I was on the phone with my ex."
How did you catch them?
No offense!
I was a little busy with something else.
His heart was broken by unrequited love.
When is it too much?
What does a man like you see in a woman like me?
You're disturbing me.
His rank is not high enough for that position.
Are you deaf?
I belong here.
You're my comrades.
He's a carpenter by profession.
Tom is not as naive as many people think.
I punched him in the jaw.
We have two daughters and one son.
I'm going on a lunch break.
Did that man attack you?
Fill out the form.
There was no one there.
Do you speak English?
Does that word even exist?
You're not Canadian.
I'm really getting married.
They all rejected Tom.
You can't fire him.
Ken's collecting old money.
There's a lot to say.
I heard what you were saying.
We have to face the facts.
No harm done.
I really want to know what's going on here.
Tom scares me.
Tom's sleeping on his back.
I'm here with Tom.
I can call you a cab.
You're not in any danger.
Which one can I choose?
We've got to get them to bed.
The only spice that Tom puts on meat is pepper.
That's how I got close to Tom.
I don't want to derange them.
Tom was beaten.
We're really good.
He fell asleep while driving, causing a traffic jam.
I brought a couple of bottles of wine.
Do you like Boston?
Tom was very upset.
Why would Tom do that?
I have a task for you.
How is a set of names formed?
You saved my life.
It was too small.
It looks different.
That's very rare.
I got a nasty cold from him.
It's getting better.
This world is a valley of tears.

The theory will be left to the mathematicians.
Where did this come from?
We're not ready.
Tom was put in prison for espionage.
Is there anything we can do to help him?
I hope you and Tom won't be too disappointed.
These small letters are read only with a magnifying glass.
I don't see the end.
They'll come looking for her.
This tooth is a cutter.
We're here to help.
He's a military officer.
He was very brave.
I'm not gonna hold my breath.
Don't buy him anything.
I hear sadness in your voice.
She's crazy about him.
The thermometer shows 10 degrees.
When did you buy that from me?
Where are the guns?
Did you kiss anyone?
I'll do as you say.
He would do anything to make money.
I recognize you now.
I don't want you to say something you don't mean.
You're decorating your room.
This is pure madness!
I think I'm gonna go visit Tom and see how he's doing.
Stay with Tom to get his hat on.
Our chunn was approaching the small island.

I'm a jerk.
They're gonna fire me because I'm too late for work.
I thought it would be nice to buy you a pair of earrings.
Tom, what's he gonna do now?
That's right!
There's always a catch.
Your health is very important to me. Why don't you go to the doctor?
Spirit, are you there?
There are no smokers here.

It has nothing to do with happiness.
I think you know the rules.
I'm really sorry about that.
How are we today?
There's your wife.
He came back at six.
Let go of these people.

Do you remember what happened last year?
You're gonna go with me and point!
It's not worth much.
I need you to find them.
Everything went well.
Where are my suitcases?
We all know Tom.
Let's do our best.
I'll pay.

I got shot.
Tom's not into drama.
I completed 25 projects in just one month.
Tom couldn't help but look at us through the key.
The tea smells good.
Well, I lied.
Do you trust them?
That column isn't very vertical.
Let's see what happens if we let Tom do what he wants.
I'm very good with animals.
Has anyone told you that?
Why are you calling?
They spoke silently.
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to speak French.
We have to go back.
I think so.
I don't think Tom knows how to do that.
Tom has a little dick.
Tom believes everything Mary told him.
Let's make a deal.
I'm not going anywhere.
Well, what's the point?
Can you sign this?
He's as tall as she is.
They were being chased.
I didn't believe him.
You can't help us now.
Do you know how much it costs?
We decided to visit the museum together.
Ah, I've been here before!
That was the idea.
You were being chased.
Let's go down the street.
There was no soul in the parking lot.
Tom knew Mary didn't speak French.
I don't dig your wells.
I have a few minutes left.
Hold on a second.
Tom loves you so much.
You cook well.
There is no shortcut to the top, only to failure.
Tom's pretty weak.
Its surface was as flat as a mirror.
Don't you want to keep it?
Tom gets paid a lot.
It was sad.
You seem to care about her.
Come and dance with me.
I've already asked them all.
Automatic cars are now widespread.
I can't make that decision.
I told the police that Tom was with me at the time.
He went to eat.
Then there's a problem...
Tom wears chairs.
No matter what you do, you have to do your best.
I'm not good enough for you.
It's new money.
I waved Tom again.
Tom wants us to think he's happy.
I have to be punished.
Who ate my dinner?
Orgular was an older man.
I played tennis.
I think you can help me.
Does his aunt eat an apple or a banana?
You're a moron.
He was sitting next to her.
Why don't you do as I showed you?
I'm making a kigana.
I love the blue color.
The girl released the bird.
I didn't tell you to take the bribe.
Don't sugar-coat my coffee.
Tom gave his daughter a stuffed bunny.
I think we should help him.
If there is no pornography with it, it will be done.
I've been ringing for hours.
He died a few years ago.
Can you teach me how to play the violin?
They picked her up pretty well.
What does all this mean?
I did what I could.
We have three children.
I'll give you mine, but I don't like it anyway.
I hope that didn't really happen.
I think you're too sick to go to school.
You were an asset to me spending the night with a smart, witty, and beautiful girl like you.
I'm a little rusty.
The girl ran away from home and got rid of her parents' control.
Tom's a mess.
Tom didn't hit Mary.
A census was conducted in 2005.
I forget where I put it.
Tom didn't say that.
You're not invited.
You said you'd text me tonight, but you lied to me, obviously.
Wait a minute.
He undressed to bathe.
A river of sweat began to flow down my face.
Mary renounced her moral values and became a nihilist.
Let's just fight it.
I'm learning mathematics.
The pianos are expensive.
I'd like a glass of wine.
How were you moving?
Movies are a great distraction.
At first I didn’t see anything.
That's an interesting hypothesis.
It's just a temporary solution.
We stole it.
Make me love the jazz.
They're staring at you.
I'd do anything to help Tom.
I want to know when you plan to leave.
How many guests are we expecting tonight?
He's in the hospital.
I guess I misjudged him.
I appreciate your help with this.
Everyone was smiling.
I didn't ask for your opinion.
The flight was cancelled due to inclement weather.
If the universe is the answer, what is the question?
Tom sat there patiently.
Singers use microphones to make their voices louder.
They can come back.
I'm so scared!
The whole board is against it.
The world lights up the sun.
His argument was logical.
Come here right now, Tom.
That wasn't exactly true.
I'll go see what I can find out.
How long will it take you to paint my house?
Tom had made himself a tree.
Oh, well, that's great.
Avoid the bad company.
The airport is nearby.
What do you think we should do next?
I want Tom to hear your story.
Tom's not scared.
I cut off my finger.
What did I do with that brochure?
It didn't get so bad.
The tap doesn't come out.
Tom killed himself.
Tom promised to take care of Mary.
Mary likes to drink hot coffee, and Tom likes milk.
I gave him a fake address.
I've got it.
I'm not mad anymore.
There's a good chance Jane's coming.
I'm lazy.
I think so.
I think you panicked.
The wallet I found was full of cash.
Tell Tom I'll be home soon.
The girl has a mouse.
You're gonna need this.
What matters to me is what you think of Tom.
They started shooting.
Tom nodded.
I think Tom knows who stole my wallet.
Did you invent that, Tom?
What would be my lawyer?
The nuns sing.
Tom recommended Mary.
Who were they?
Tom began to speak.
Tom doesn't look so good.
I'm really going to try to be nice to Tom.
Tom eats everything.
Where does Tom buy?
It looked terrible.
They're all liars.
How can anyone be so stupid?
Tom left without me.
It's all quiet again.
It's a minor mistake.
I really hope so.
Wake up.
I have a lot of problems right now.
Answer me right now.
Let me help you.
Tom has a problem with anger.
Get him.
You pay me very well.
I feel like a completely new person.
Bring me a drink.
I think I'm cold.
The question is whether it can or not.
Tom's running up.
Tom will kill me when he finds out what I did.
He's still there.
Aren't you going to eat?
You need to make this work.
It's not that deep.
I thought you were only dating girls who were inferior to you.
I need to tighten my belt.
Tom was about to run into Mary.
I hate my roommate.
Tom didn't listen to his parents.
I don't want Tom in there.
Let's go get some hamburgers.
You've probably seen much worse.
Did you talk to Tom?
Tom liked what Mary said.
This is not a place for a three-year-old.
I can ski.
He built a new house.
I wasn't expecting you.
I'm glad you didn't call him.
Tom went to Boston last week.
I sleep standing up.
I'm getting weaker.
The cake looks good.
Did someone break your heart?
That's how I feel, too.
What's holding you back?
We want to see Tom.
Where'd Tom go?
Who won the prize?
Please, come on time.
The Germans have a weaker attitude towards nudity.
We can't help her now.
Please don't move.
You can't deny that.
Tom's not coming back.
Is this your picture?
Your sister's asleep.
Dan visited the restaurant last summer.
Is that why you don't want to help us?
When their leader died, they placed his body in a large tomb.
Women love men with mustaches.
You've forgotten your wallet again.
Do you accept bribes?
I want to know if Tom can come tomorrow or not.
If we don't do that, then who?
I wish I could be like Tom.
Suddenly I heard a loud noise.
They both froze.
Did you buy these for us?
I hope not.
How much money do you think I can get for one kidney?
I told you to open the door.
I didn't expect that.
Can you deliver this?
I've had no luck.
His body was covered with brown fur.
Tom didn't want Mary to cry.
I've really pissed Tom off.
The week consists of seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
How much do you know about them?
Tom sent me a note.
I don't like Boston.
I know that sounds naive.
Now come on in.
I'm pretty sure Tom likes you.
I'm the one who's gonna help him, not you.
I didn't kill anyone.
The inhabitants of the island are friendly.
Let's try Tom first.
I've always wanted more mysterious characters.
Throw me the ball.
I want to bring them here.
I'm anemic.
I voted for you.
I want to eat pineapple for breakfast.
I thought I'd tell you.
What's with the hat?
Tom is one of the most prominent American poets.
Couldn't be a coincidence.
Is that necessary?
Don't worry, Tom.
Tom Kisses will never come back here again.
No one likes to cry.
He was crying for a toy.
He tried to climb a distant mountain.
I missed the game.
It was just a joke.
I'd do that if I could.
Tom's just fucked up.
Try to explain that to Tom.
We arrived first.
I already gave her your number.
My soap burned my eyes.
I'm glad to see you all again.
Tom was very fond of Mary.
Tom tried the wine.
Tom told Mary about John.
We started talking.
I'd be happy to help.
It's all very informal.
This is not the right way.
I know I can do more.
You're learning fast.
We ate a lot of nice food.
Tom's been out of work for three months.
Tom can't offer much.
I've been spanked.
No one's gonna bother you.
I couldn't find them.
I didn't even know you had one.
Look out the window.
Mary bought smelly bags of garbage.
I suffer from asthma.
He got used to working in the garden for two hours a day.
Tom rarely comes out.
Tom caught malaria when he traveled to Africa.
We wanted to see him.
How did you know where Tom hid the diamonds?
Is it all there?
Tom's passport expired.
You deserve a medal.
They're really strong.
How did you make such a mistake?
You're good at remembering.
Can he do whatever he wants?
It's time to say goodbye.
It's getting harder to breathe.
It's really warm.
We're bringing them bad news.
We should go home.
Tom hit me.
I was going to vote for him.
Tom was the only one in the room who didn't know French.
Why did you go there?
Clean it up.
Tom is still not fully aware of what happened.
Cocaine is a drug.
This is a little harder.
You seem to already know the answer.
Could you take us?
Look in the mirror.
Robin Hood robbed the rich.
Tom didn't go.
Who owns the ships?
Yeah, and?
I asked where Tom was.
It was of great benefit to us.
What do you usually do in your free time?
I'll come save you.
I have a stone in my shoe.
Give him something to eat.
We fucked up.
Who made the doll?
I haven't lost hope in a moment.
Her long hair was boney brown.
We'll be back in a few months.
Please, give him a chance.
I never ask for a handle.
I didn't tell anyone, not even my mother.
Don't come into my room.
We're just getting started.
I didn't want to brag.
There was no need to speak.
My jaw hurts.
Tom wanted Mary to go to the post office with him.
What's his purpose?
I want someone else.
Don't talk.
They may need our help.
I've got some doughnuts.
I'm studying French.
Don't let me see you.
It was too late.
I live on the lowest floor.
The girls won't be playing tennis tomorrow.
That's a good answer.
I was reckless.
Mary broke up our friendship.
I just can't get the information I need.
I tried to get them to stop.
I enjoyed Tom’s insight.
We need to call Tom.
They're gonna hang her.
Tom didn't know why.
Let's all have dinner.
You won't need that.
One day I went for a walk in the woods.
Let's leave him alone for a while.
I never wear suits.
The heater's broken.
He's gone.
His clientele is composed mainly of the poor.
None of us were right.
Find the differences.
That's terrible.
Why is that bothering you?
Tom says he wants to do it too.
Women love men with mustaches.
We spent the afternoon fooling around on the beach.
I don't care about them.
People are constantly dying.
He's a perfect fit for that passerby.
Can you make that stop?
Call me if there's a problem.
He's ruining his clothes.
Take out your sword.
I can't wait to go to Boston.
Tom didn't like it.
Tom seems a little sloppy on the left.
No one understood me.
I was sad.
Would you like some tea?
Stay with us for a few days.
Tom didn't know where he was.
Tom slammed his brain.
Tom died a few years ago.
I wanted to discuss this topic with you.
Did he ask for money?
Don't talk so loud.
She works in a bank.
Death, in any form, is disgusting.
Do you want to vote?
The more danger, the more honor.
We should have bought another bottle of wine.
Add the onion.
We're old friends.
Tom took off his hat and politely bowed.
That's one reason.
Give me back my book, I need it again.
Mark thinks he's a good writer.
Tom looked.
My ears are ringing.
I take this opportunity to thank her.
Tom's not very neat.
Don't listen to him!
Can I say something?
You're such a jerk!
Who's making him breakfast?
I don't understand this song.
They call me Captain.
Tom's complex.
Tom didn't want to kneel.
Tom was suspended.
They're getting riled up.
She's gonna be a teacher.
I'm not going to tell Tom that.
I'd like marinated fish and seafood.
I was horrified.
Tom looks devastated.
Something's weird.
You're not that old, Tom.
Have you become an angel?
That’s all we know about them.
Do you think that's what's bothering us?
Maybe we'll find help in the nearest village.
We hope it's good.
You're capable, but you're oblivious.
He's been working at the embassy for three months.
We're on vacation now.
Maybe we'll have a chance to talk to Tom later.
I'll get them.
Tom became violent.
You don't work here.
I think you should do this alone.
Is anyone surprised?
Stay where you are, please.
I'll help him as much as I can.
Tom's mad.
It's work.
We'll make it.
Appreciation encourages students to work hard.
Tom's not very photogenic.
Tom unlocked the car door.
I don't agree with that.
Stop wasting my money.
Tom is about 30 years old.
What's the deal?
I see how upset you are.
All right, I'll order it.
We'll figure it out.
I can make you a deal.
He's on his way.
Dan attacked two of them.
Tom measured his weight.
Something must have happened to Tom.
Tom has changed a lot since last year.
I guess I should go talk to Tom.
Tom raised his nose.
Tom seems a little shaken up.
He's fucked.
I'm just so proud of you.
At that time, the title "lady" was used only for nobles.
Tom has been learning French for years.
Let's ask her something else.
Speak on your own behalf.
Do you believe that?
How do you choose just one?
I'm here to feed Tom the fish.
Actually, I'm here to help you.
I don't feel it.
My poor uncle was there, stretched out on a bloody bed, with a dagger buried deep in his heart.
Someone's trying to kill us.
They're paying me to clean Tom's garage.
You can rest.
Couldn't be more certain.
How long will you stay with us?
You must be very proud.
You used to be so funny.
Could you stay a while?
Don't talk to anyone.
She licked the spoon.
I'm just thinking out loud.
You're specific.
You should give him some space.
You almost missed Tom.
Where's the mailbox?
I'm listening to your kid's laugh.
Tom suspects that Mary and I are forging something.
Just leave us in the lurch.
Tom's pretty skinny.
Tom usually wins in fights.
You can handle this.
Did you hear the thunder?
Don't mix work and pleasure.
I'm working in Boston now.
Put the crown on the king's head.
Tom held his breath.
Tom was busy with work.
I'll meet you.
I'm glad you're okay.
Your patent has been unsealed.
This is one of mine.
Nothing's stopping us.
Tom's sweating.
Tom got up from the couch.
Don't get mad, Tom.
I turned on the fan and pointed it toward the wall.
This is homemade jam.
Tom asked for Mary's help.
There are no examples.
Just give me one day.
Police found Tom's body in a shallow grave behind the barn.
Tom writes very well.
That's not exactly true.
Rats are small.
Please, stay close.
We're done talking.
I brought you water.
Let him bark like a dog.
I'm tired of Boston.
Tom had a severe headache.
As soon as he saw it, his heart stopped.
It's probably hard.
They're locked inside.
Tom was driving in the back seat.
The bank borrowed a million dollars from the company.
I have a lot more to tell you.
I'm always recording.
What are the conditions?
Will you stay, Tom?
I know what's important to you, and I'll do my best to destroy it.
Play more relaxed.
My son always interrupts me when I'm talking.
This is Tom calling.
I'll drive alone.
Looks like I had too much to drink last night, and I'm really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really,
Tom was having a party.
Tom said he couldn't remember the guy's name.
I'm going to grab your baby.
It was pretty funny.
Tom closed the door.
I'm interested in sports.
I have a surprise for her.
Do you want to borrow an interesting book?
Tom was moving cautiously.
Just get in there.
He demanded a sword of steel.
I moved into a new house last week, and yesterday I studied the library.
I said my own.
You're funny.
Is that all we need?
Tom cut his nose.
When will I see you?
I promise I won't do anything to hurt you.
Tom's a unit.
The woman calls the man.
Tom found something really interesting.
They had more than us.
It's gonna be okay.
I can't believe you.
What did Tom want to see?
I'm so scared.
Dan is furious.
I don't even know which is which.
I'm not ringing them.
I'm not sure where to put this.
Tom couldn't stand it anymore.
It's hard to explain.
What's their purpose?
I'll send him to stay with you.
It was very generous of you to buy us all these things.
I couldn't let Tom die.
Did they put Tom in the hospital?
You'll feel better.
The rules are as follows.
This is the pool where Tom learned to swim.
Tom cut the apple in half.
Don't you want to play tennis?
There's something under the table.
You can't leave Boston today.
Tell Tom to wait for me at the post office.
What college did you go to?
It's about integrity.
Please don't let go of my hand.
I'd better call him back.
Tom's not very funny.
Tom knows too much.
Are you the new assistant?
Don't mess with Tom.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
Wipe your eyes.
Tom just walked in.
I had a blood vessel in my eye.
That's where you visited Mary yesterday.
She's exaggerating!
He's got a son who's gone missing.
I'm trying to work.
What's your taste?
Let's talk about Tom.
I have a feeling the show is going to give up; they haven’t sold a lot of cards.
Tom's coming.
Tom thinks he shouldn't use deodorant.
Does Tom swim often?
The girl fell asleep.
Go home and write.
Do not force the child to eat.
I'd like to ask you about them.
You're a laughing stock.
Tom paid me.
I'm lucky to read books.
They killed him.
Nothing can happen to you.
Dan wanted to have a lot of kids.
Tom's acting stupid.
Go to sleep, Tom.
Tell me the details.
Tom was very warm.
We always have to support our children.
Everyone has their own mania.
Tom was sitting behind the wheel.
What do we do with them?
Tom knew what he was planning to cook Mary for dinner.
What are you looking at here?
I feel like it’s raining all day.
You can't call them.
Did Tom look upset?
They'll probably come by car.
I'm grateful to you.
You've already got a new boyfriend.
Although Jane had one suitcase less than me, she complained that she had too much to carry.
I really miss them.
You're terrible.
Where does he live? In some part of Eastern Europe.
Mary's the right expert.
Excuse me for a moment.
I don't think I want to do that right now.
I can't sleep with the light on.
There's too much acid in oranges.
Tom came to help.
Too much time has passed.
I had a hamster named Cookie.
Tom's on a business trip.
Tom said he was going to burn the slug.
Do you know how that could have happened?
I'll write you a note.
You're very lonely.
Please do not add any comments.
That was Tom's only fault.
Do you remember what you were wearing when I met you?
Lightning usually accompanies thunderstorms.
Tom likes cinnamon tea.
I know his address.
Tom knew Mary.
Can I come with Tom?
Tom looks nervous.
I have a little fever.
Tom threw it on the ground.
This lecture has no end!
The glasses are in the glass jar.
Give us some time.
Tom wondered why Mary didn't want to have sex with him.
Excuse us for a moment.
Maybe it's time for a change.
You should wear a helmet while riding a motorcycle.
We're worried about him.
Tom's British.
John and Eve are best friends.
I'm just as strong as you are.
Tom wanted to dance.
She called the psychiatrist.
How do you not sleep yet?
Everyone knows I hate her.
He's incapable of doing that.
Tom didn’t have the guts to try to do it again.
Not all aliens are bad.
They were making love.
I burned the trash.
We've both seen him.
That would be uncultured.
Tell us where they are.
Tom is a famous conductor.
After the storm, the ocean was calm.
I think I'd better help them.
One of my friends is studying abroad.
In the tropics there are only two seasons.
I think I made a pretty good point.
I'm replacing her.
Look at the clock.
Isn't this great?
Tom said Mary's down here.
Why did you draw a face on the wall?
Are you thinking about them?
Actually, I'm in a relationship with my ex-boyfriend again.
Just get this job done.
I think Tom's beautiful.
Tom got a little pie.
What is Tom looking for?
What's your name, son?
Was the bank closed?
Tom said he knows how to play tennis, but he doesn't want to.
Your new guitar has a good sound.
What does the sign above the door say?
Sit down.
I've been thinking about your problem with Tom.
The hair and the way she holds her head reminds me of Mary.
Don't get in my way.
Here we are looking for them.
My shoes are soaked.
Tom would've given it back.
It's always worth it.
In which country are you a citizen?
The trade in ivory is illegal.
I've always wanted to travel with Mary.
I'm meeting with Tom.
I love dogs more than cats.
There’s still a bit of room in the closet.
Thanks to you, Tom.
Mary's been dyeing her hair for years.
That wasn't funny.
Tom still doesn't know how to swim.
That's usually not a good idea.
How many languages do you speak?
I know you cared a lot about Tom.
I was home alone.
I should have asked her first.
Tom's the father.
You know what I need.
You can't stand the heat.
These two seem to have calmed down.
Unfortunately, I can't let that happen.
I need you right now.
I shouldn't have done it without you.
I saw them.
Why aren't you in there?
We didn't even have a broken pair.
I tried to find Tom.
You're part of our team.
I did this for you.
You're brave, aren't you?
I can do better than that.
I didn't want it that way.
Did Tom do anything?
I see you're awake.
Keep up the work.
When are you closing?
We want to help them.
I'll bring Tom with me.
I'm a loner, you might say.
I can't handle this task.
Looks like we're gonna have to try harder.
Shouldn't we go look for her?
Does Tom know why you didn't go to his party?
I'm looking for them now.
I can't tell you what you want to know.
They're both good.
What are you looking for in Boston?
At first, I didn't understand anything.
I went to the bathroom with Mary.
Tom signed the bill.
I'm still worried about her.
I'm looking for food.
The tree floats.
We'll keep in touch.
We're almost doing it together.
That's my plan.
Tom heard Mary call John by his name.
My hands are tied.
I don't want to upset him.
Tom never sits for long.
Go with chopsticks.
I thought Tom was sick.
Everybody was talking.
I'm so proud of you.
Tom was looking for the drawers in the kitchen.
Many people in Africa died as a result of the storm.
What are you wearing?
I'll get over you.
This is a picture of Tom.
Can you give her a call?
Loud.
Then the forest was quiet.
Don't run away from me now.
I have a skin disease.
She was repressed.
We play with fate.
I thought he had bigger tits.
Maybe soon I'll be ready to go.
Tom doesn't know how to feel.
There's a little more tea in the teapot.
I must have parked my car somewhere else.
Is Buddhism a religion or a philosophy?
The heat was annoying me.
This is justified.
I didn't even know you didn't like Tom.
I know some things.
Was it all just a dream?
I can't sleep, I'm too excited to get to Pluto soon.
"I see," said the blind man.
Everyone was laughing at me on the beach.
Tom turned into a pop star.
I'd like to see a warrant.
They don't know us.
Why did you buy this?
Tom said he used to live here.
Why is Tom like that?
I have sinus problems.
I had low expectations of him.
I was really curious.
I told Tom to tell you that.
Tom's running out of water.
Esperanto does not belong to anyone.
She skillfully wields a saw.
Turn it off.
I do not share my real name on any website.
They've foiled the plan.
I don't want to lie.
"Time is not money." "Time is life."
Tom needed the money.
I don't cry when I'm sad.
I can protect you.
Let me give you this.
I thought I lost all my money, but I guess I was wrong.
I have three children.
Turn off the alarm.
Why can't Tom come to us?
Try to be brave, Tom.
Your house is very beautiful.
The police are looking for me.
Tom's not that tall.
He's been back for a week, up and down.
He is slowly recovering from the disease.
I want a turnip.
He's too old to go fast.
Tom looked really angry.
Let Tom talk.
I know you still love Tom.
Step away from Tom.
It was so obvious.
How do I get Tom?
I was calm until I saw the syringe.
I want to be there.
One of them could be her.
I'm taking you to school.
The fly is on the ceiling.
Her face was rubbed with sperm.
Tom's fair.
You should do this first.
We met around noon.
There's nothing wrong with me tonight.
Bring him a drink.
Oh, thank you.
Thanks for telling me.
It's an order, Tom.
It's from the Bible.
We eat apples.
Is that moral?
You know what that looks like?
Pretend you won.
I'm very confused.
They were waiting outside.
He was lazy and irresponsible, so they ordered him to leave the firm.
I'd understand any of you.
Tom strives to become a teacher.
I wish you a good week!
Do you still want to go to the zoo on Monday?
One is life.
How many people are in the house?
Tom needs to go now.
Why did God make me so ugly?
Why do you blame them?
It's too expensive.
We are behaving childishly.
Tom was barefoot.
Tom would enjoy this.
Tom's up.
Let's go outside and talk.
Alcohol is the answer. I don't know what the question was.
You didn't buy that, did you?
You're all the same.
Look what it started now.
We're a team!
We agreed to help them.
You can't sell it.
Shaika punched the tire.
We made a tree.
This is so much better.
I'm gonna make her use your lawn.
Tom likes math.
Tom withdrew his money from the bank.
I just wanted to help Tom.
You need to sit down.
The harder, the better.
You can rest.
I eat with my kids every week.
Tom has always been stubborn.
You bake bread in your ovens.
You're a bruka.
Your sons are very handsome.
I know how much it's worth.
Call me if you find her.
We ate lobster and steak.
You have to forgive me.
The girl went to school despite her illness.
Tom tried to help me.
They knocked on the door.
Tom came to stay with us for a few days last spring.
You think it's weird just because it's not a protein.
She decided not to pay the fine.
I admire them.
My car's in the back.
Tom wanted to find out where Linda was the night before.
It's so terrible.
I'll bring her home.
We gave them an apple.
I can't dispute that.
I'm not a patient.
Tom didn't say much.
I have no use for that.
It still doesn't work.
Give me an example.
I definitely need to buy you a drink.
In case this happens again, call me.
Was he honest?
The box was empty.
Don't talk.
You're busy, aren't you?
They won't let go.
They're getting close.
Mom and Dad won't come with me.
The vampire is still alive in the coffin.
No, I'm not mad at you.
She's our neighbor.
I've done my job.
We'll deal with them.
Please, move fast.
I'm too young to die.
I hate opera.
I'll call someone.
Where should these documents be handed over?
Tom has a bruise on his eye.
Tom's company is in danger.
Have you ever done that?
Maybe Tom's wrong.
She hates to run.
I couldn't call you.
Is it true?
I know you're mad.
By the time I left, Tom was still in his pajamas.
If I shower with hot water, I blur the mirror in the bathroom.
Tom was painting.
Tom thought Mary was going to be at Tom's party.
You're the only one who can make me laugh.
Unfortunately, I don’t have enough money at the moment.
"Are you a vegetarian?" "No, and you?"
Lightning hit the tower.
Did you see his face?
I'm not speculating.
It's just wrong.
Tom stopped talking.
Would you like a dog?
We'll always be here.
I didn't know your father died.
They raised my salary again.
I'm never going to get in there again.
I'm making a movie.
I forgot your number.
Tom has a job to do.
What do we do today?
Do you believe in horoscopes?
I know I'm going.
I'm contributing.
It was a disaster!
Tom is very good at his job.
I made it all up.
I'd like to know why they deleted my name from the list.
Tom arranged all this.
I'm not gonna betray her.
The flowers attract bees.
The water is milk.
There was no such thing as a plant life in this world.
You're incapacitated.
What was Tom’s response?
You'll do as I command.
Who's gonna believe you?
Who are you dating?
Who are we?
It was worth a try.
I did the right thing.
Tom's a long way off.
Tom likes to write.
Tom is very practical.
I can't say for sure.
They say the old chapel is cursed.
Let's ask them something else.
Why isn't Tom's name on the list?
Yeah, well?
I am very interested in learning Chinese.
It's easy to see why people love Tom.
I couldn't give him these.
I haven't been taught that.
She's got tight hips.
I'm not ovulating.
Maybe Tom's not telling the truth.
Will you vote for him?
The famous critic and the poet travel together.
There's no time to explain.
Will they arrest me?
This violates all the rules.
Why aren't you at home?
You have to resign.
We tried to get them to tell us.
Come on, beer.
There's a Mr. Kimura on the line waiting for you.
Men and women are people of the opposite sex.
That's mostly true.
I know Tom didn't play fair.
The wound released pus.
No, and it's not even under the capital.
I'm a little drunk.
Can we talk to you?
Tom couldn't resist.
Tom covered his head with a pillow.
Tom must be feeling lonely.
What did you look for on the internet?
I think it would be a mistake to borrow Tom's money.
Our solar system is constantly on the move.
I couldn't find her.
Tom threw Mary's paperwork at the desk.
Tom did this.
I teach art history.
I don't quite agree.
What's on the agenda?
There's a lot more.
These two seem to be in a relationship again.
I'm not unemployed.
Tom still doesn't speak French very well.
Mary was in Hungary.
They're aliens.
It is the translator's moral choice whether to translate something or not. Certain things are better left to the language he produced.
You're ugly.
Tom avoids Mary when he can.
Before you do that, you need to get Tom's permission.
You look beautiful.
Think about what you want.
I thought I'd ask for his help.
Do I look normal?
Are you going to eat?
I need a box of kids.
I did it.
Check it out.
Give me the French key.
Tom seems to be worried.
It was a meeting.
Tom and Mary know what happened.
We just hired Tom.
Tom won the lottery.
I was impressed by Tom’s kindness.
Tom has no hope.
Tom wears glasses.
I'll keep working here as long as I can.
Who do you know in Boston?
I thought maybe Tom knows where Mary put the key.
There was a big crowd at the party.
Because the orbit is oval, the distance between the planets and the sun constantly varies.
That's what Tom told me.
Tom looked into Mary’s eyes and smiled.
It was very crowded in that room, because all the windows were closed.
Tom could get hurt.
Everything's fine.
The stars are shining.
Oh, really?
I can touch the floor with my hands without bending my knees.
Tom's a white man.
Tom could have done better.
I didn't call you because of that, Tom.
Maybe it's too late.
That you found them.
I couldn't sleep.
That's good enough for him.
Tom's home.
You'll be known in time.
I don't know them.
Tom was brutally murdered on October 20, 2013.
I thought you were in Boston.
I don't think we should wait any longer.
I thought Tom was gonna be busy.
That woman had a child.
I really like you.
It was kind of you to let me stay here last night.
You don't need to write more than 400 words.
With a friend like you, I don't need enemies.
That's why I brought you here.
We can have lunch on the bus.
Tom told me not to do that.
I've always been careful not to say too much.
You're shitting me.
We'll go shopping.
Tom knew Mary was going to like John.
Tom's a pain in the ass.
I just saw your finger.
I'm gonna go ask Tom.
My head hurts.
I wouldn't recommend that.
We only have one life.
Why does Tom have to go?
Would he lie to you?
He has a passive character.
Maybe someone was following her.
My wife was here once.
It's a medicine in the right.
We walked along the coast.
I don't want you to bully them.
It depends on your decision.
That's doable.
Tom's reacting badly.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages? No.
Tom was counting on you.
It's not attractive.
Few people understand that.
You're very cut off.
Aren't you a banker?
It was a great pleasure for her to meet her great-grandson.
That's our best chance.
It smells like flowers.
Tom stared at her.
I asked them to turn around.
I trust the teacher.
Tom grabbed a fire extinguisher and began to inject.
She likes tennis.
I wasn't even in Boston the night Tom was killed.
I need you for a second.
Have as much fun as you can!
Whose are these?
Speak on your own behalf.
It resulted in great difficulty.
She slowly developed a hatred for me.
I don't think you're up for it.
I don't cry when I'm happy.
Didn't we agree?
I'd like to help him prove it.
Your arguments are illogical to me.
Tom seems indecisive.
I asked them to leave.
They were waiting for her.
Tom can't resist.
I'll never forget her.
I don't think I like that.
Either he's wrong or I'm wrong.
My computer's jammed.
My grandmother lived with us.
We'll be right there.
You forgot your backpack!
And so conscience really makes us all cowards.
There's no need to panic.
I gave him one of those.
I don't expect anything less than perfection.
I think that hotel's gonna be a little expensive for you.
Tom picked up the box.
I should have checked.
He couldn't take his pants off.
I don't have to convince them.
What are you drinking?
Tom didn't want to help me.
You're wrong.
We're glad to see you.
You may leave now, sir.
Maybe it's him.
You're ready to cry.
Tom didn't want to play poker.
Tom went to Boston.
The screen emits a green light.
English has become my favorite subject.
Things happened quickly.
Where's the evidence?
When we woke up on the left, we were faced with terrible news.
The knee wound is now purulent.
Wipe your eyes.
Mary was scared.
It's none of your business!
Tom wouldn't touch anything.
Tom is an agricultural worker.
We helped them once.
Tom seems to enjoy it.
Maybe Tom can hear you.
How long has Tom been sleeping?
Our job is to help them.
He suffered a great loss.
Tom just needs a little rest.
What else do you eat?
Promise me you'll help us.
I'll stay in the car.
Would you like a mint candy?
Why would Tom do that to us?
I don't even want to know.
They're gonna do it.
I'm gonna have to spend the night here.
I almost cut myself.
I'm going down here.
We're paranoid.
This is not silver.
A blood vessel burst into his brain.
How many spare keys do you have for the car?
Is that your mother?
Tom wasn't the kind of guy you'd find easy to get along with.
I don't want pork.
She wants to run.
I need a seaweed.
It was a premeditated crime.
You're not ready yet, are you?
I think it would be best if I stayed here for a while.
Tom rereads the note.
The children drew pictures of the pavement with chalk.
You wonder what you've been up to so long.
Did you get an answer from him?
I need to take her home.
These monks live in the monastery.
I went to Boston twice.
Tom married at the age of 26.
We've already cleared that up.
Do you want me to pick you up from the airport?
We're playing with the computer.
No, it's not even under the capital.
Tom and I are drinking buddies.
I didn't see a ghost.
I just don't think it's appropriate.
Tom knows he's listening.
Tom always tries to do what he thinks is right.
Tom doesn't seem to realize what's going on.
Come and visit us in the near future.
Did you have breakfast today?
What's this about?
She invited me to dinner.
She likes to brag about the magnificent chandeliers she has in the house.
I'm not a resident.
What's in your plate?
Tom can't find Mary.
You know what's going on right now.
Tom refused to tell us what happened.
You smell like shit.
What's your favorite nail polish?
I'm learning the piano.
They need the money.
He swims well.
You won't find us.
I heard from her.
You don't get involved in this.
Thank you for giving me as much time as I needed to finish this.
I was watching TV when Tom came in.
You're not.
Do you think you can stop me?
Actually, it's very common.
I decided to forgive them.
I know you do.
Did I do something to make Tom angry?
Triangles don't have four corners.
There is not enough light to read.
Tom's dealing with Mary.
Tom was just listening.
Mary unwrapped the lipstick.
Oh, guess what.
Tom's ashamed of me.
Guess what he said to me.
When did you buy that from us?
Let's keep this between us.
I've looked everywhere.
I'll talk.
Tom was asking about you.
I forgot my wallet.
Everyone's waiting for her.
It could be risky.
I'm a teacher, too.
I thought Tom was gonna be here.
If you see Tom, tell him I'm looking for him.
At least we're having fun.
Your moon is coming back.
Tom's wearing John's shirt.
He found his parents.
He gave us a suspicious answer.
Wake me up as soon as he's undressed.
Mr. Gorbachev, tear down the wall!
Tom seems to be confused.
Tom's got a record.
It's the way it's supposed to be.
Let's try to fit in.
It's gonna be hard.
I don't like retirement.
Thanks for asking.
I have a good reason not to love Tom.
That gave me an idea.
Can I start eating?
I'll look into it right away.
These shoes are hers.
Let him call me.
The rooms are clogged.
Tom wasn't mad at you.
This letter should not have been sent at all.
The girl who wears a scarf is a virgin.
Don't you think Tom looks like an old man?
This puppet is my only friend.
My lawyer's coming.
I don't think Tom will fight much.
What are you doing?
I'll call him right away.
That's our secret.
Dan gave Linda money for an abortion.
I'm Tom's neighbor.
What were your teachers like?
We had meetings.
Tom will be back in a few minutes.
The Prince inherited the throne.
You won't find me.
Are those my glasses?
I know that for sure.
I've never felt so loved.
I can't control her.
She's driving me crazy.
I'll be back in time.
It's nothing urgent.
I'll pick her up now.
If you kiss me, I'll be happy.
I care about all of you.
I'll take the subway.
I didn't get an answer from them.
Tom doesn't care about me.
I'll always be here.
I can't wait to tell you.
Tom's coming.
Tom married Mary last year.
Tom goes to school by car.
Did you watch it?
I'm gonna have to think about this carefully.
I'll buy a calendar.
Everybody's talking about me.
Do you ever think about us?
Do you write the sayings?
It was a great series.
We should go find them.
The last time I was home was on Friday night when I was 13.
Tom knows that Mary knows.
We're worried about them.
You always forget.
Take off your hat.
I don't know what you think will change.
I'm doing it for him.
She can be trusted.
Are you hurt?
It wasn't my idea.
It's all I've got.
What did Tom find now?
We stayed up all night trying to come up with a plan.
Tom's so angry.
Tom's going to sleep.
Let's protect our peace!
Tom's well-armed.
We were worried.
I forgot to tell you when the meeting started.
I forgot my passport.
Tom told us to stay here.
I'm not armed.
Do you hate them so much?
We have to buy him a present.
I know what happened at school today.
I have a glass of beer to quench my thirst.
Tom arrived on time.
Today, television is boring.
Oh, that's great.
Tom found a four-leaf clover.
I asked Tom not to drive too fast.
Tom looks really sad.
Maybe it's not just a coincidence.
You can't take that away from me.
Please look at me.
She gave up smoking.
Tom found evidence.
We went to say hello to them.
You didn't smoke?
All visitors must be examined.
Where'd you get that scar?
You're nobody and nothing.
We won't find them.
The association was founded in the 1990s.
Isn't that dangerous?
This sounds totally valid.
It's the law!
The water penetrates the stone.
You should ask Tom.
Please, write that down.
Tom arrived safely.
I can stay.
I don't see customers complaining.
Here, I want challenges.
He's not sitting on a bench.
I should have done that yesterday.
We're very similar to Tom.
Tom's not my cousin.
Beware of the sparks that fly out of the fire.
It's just made up.
Tom had been hugging Mary all night.
He wanted to spend more time with his family.
We enjoyed swimming in the lake.
I keep dreaming of you.
Let's find out more about her.
I'm not going to tell anyone your secret unless you tell me I can.
Let's gather a soul.
I'm sure he'll pass the exam as soon as he gets there.
We're going to Boston.
Tom's a good dad.
Stay here, okay?
Don't you know it's hopeless?
He kissed her passionately in the mouth.
Tom went to the store and bought three buckets of bug spray.
It was gross.
You don't owe me anything.
Tom turned into a werewolf.
I bought these meds for my dad.
The kids love cake.
He was quite restrained.
I could end up with Tom.
Tom's getting angry.
This is from us.
In case of emergency, what number should I call?
I still want a horse.
I didn't even touch it.
Who's in charge here?
He admitted that he had to lie.
Mary raised all the money for Tom.
Enough with the nonsense.
Otherwise, Mike, please tell me how to get to you.
Tom has always wanted a son.
Tom has a big mouth.
It looks like tea.
Tom has asthma.
Tom began to sneeze.
The butterflies are beautiful.
I didn't bring them.
Maybe it won't be as hard as you think it will be.
We would like to order 18 tons of olive oil.
Tom was out of work earlier.
Everything is with us.
I baked his cookies.
When does the school year end?
You're right from the start.
How did you do it without our help?
Why didn't you say "goodbye"?
How many instruments can you play?
Who was in the car?
This is my last.
I haven't found them yet.
I'm being ignored.
Hang on to the fence.
These must be fakes.
Beauty can not be determined objectively, but depends on personal aesthetic criteria.
Tom is unstoppable.
His girlfriend's weakened.
It's over between me and Tom.
Tom didn't know who Mary's parents were.
Did I invite you?
Tom's always here.
You left me in despair.
Tom screaming woke up from a nightmare.
Tom has poor eyesight.
The flash didn't work, so he couldn't paint in the dark.
We agreed to start right away.
Is it done?
Everyone wants a lasting peace.
We met a day ago.
Where are you going with Tom?
Is the coffee hot?
Tom opened his eyes.
The tribe was not too happy that a peacemaker was coming.
Open it.
Put on your apron.
You could be wrong.
I also made a cake.
Tom has a plantation.
Why is Tom still in school?
It was an honor.
I talked to my counselors about what items to take.
I’ve already written everything that needs to be written.
Make sure you don't worry about me.
We can take a break.
Boston is worth seeing.
Now there's no one in the classroom.
We didn't mention that.
I can't believe Tom was the one who stole Mary's wheel.
Is Dan aware of what he's done?
We couldn't see the top of the mountain.
I'll say whatever you want.
Tom has no friends.
Who lives in the room under this one?
I want you back here.
Tom wants you to do it, so he doesn't have to do it himself.
I got what I wanted.
How do I get there?
Tom's a nice guy.
I never change my sleeping schedule.
So, what's in the box?
She was sitting on the bench.
Guys, come here.
Have you seen him?
Tom wasn't sure about anything.
What do you think of her?
What's the worst that could happen?
Don't tell Tom what you saw here.
Come on, I'll carry you.
I set Tom up.
You must be confused.
Mary whispered something to Tom in his ear.
Tom knows how to be very vindictive.
I've seen it happen.
We're gonna miss Tom so much.
I'm pretty sure Tom hasn't done anything like this before.
You're very bold.
I thought I'd mention it.
Is Tatoeba really too slow today, or does it seem to me?
Did you ask me on Google?
Emotions are contagious.
I was just taking a shower.
Tom's probably in the kitchen.
Tom's back.
That's what you need.
I fell in love with you.
We are mannequins.
What do you want?
Tom found a new job.
Tom won't be back before dinner.
Tom betrayed you.
I need to pack.
That responsibility is a burden to him.
Tom's still playing golf, isn't he?
I'm having a snack today.
Pop music is my favorite form of music.
It's been half an hour.
I'm waiting for him to come back.
That was awe-inspiring.
I can't see anything.
He's a very unpleasant man!
They crucified their tent on the beach.
I didn't want that at all.
It's better to be alone.
I have to warn Tom.
The two brothers are musicians.
Tom is jealous.
Tom took the picture off the wall and hung another one in that place.
Hold it!
You want some cheese?
I'll call you.
He's getting tired fast.
It's different now.
Are we ready to go?
Cows are by no means clear.
That was very sloppy on Tom's part.
It's hollow.
I'm helping Tom with something.
I got mad.
Let them scratch you.
Cutting is a waste of energy.
Tom went to rehab.
They will pay well.
Tom's probably out.
We didn't fight.
Tom stared inside.
At the same time you are heavy and light, and pleasant and bitter; I cannot live with you or without you.
Let's say for now that you're right.
Tom's doing great.
I'm not listening.
Do I have to eat with Tom?
No one complained about that.
I'll see you later.
It's hot in here.
That disappoints him.
Don't talk about us.
It is one of the most popular restaurants in the city.
You have to try, Tom.
I wish I could understand.
Tom's an invertebrate.
I guess most of them went home.
It's hard to explain.
You missed us.
Can you tell Tom we're back?
Let's get them back.
I refuse to do that.
They all look alike.
Don't forget him.
We have to find them first.
I'm running an account.
Tom hit Mary on the head with the tray.
Tom's gonna kill you.
It's better if we both get some sleep.
I always mix those two names.
Tom's wearing a jacket.
I found a place to live.
I need a musical instrument.
The report is very boxed in.
You should help them.
Tom didn't cry.
He wrote a book, and it was great.
Tom turned the hook.
I hope this is good.
If they're lying about it, then we have a much bigger problem.
I see ghosts.
I was tired and cold.
Nothing is more pitiful than stupidity and indifference.
They're all messing around.
Tom didn't protest.
What is the purpose of websites?
Vampires live forever.
They both smiled.
What's in your hand?
She is a young student.
They're sympathetic.
I hate eggplants.
I didn't say I did it.
Dan wants to be a dictator.
I spent the whole day cleaning the snow.
His paralysis is getting worse, and soon, he won't be able to get out of bed.
Do you want to race?
I need Tom.
Change is never easy.
Is Boston far away?
They're paying me to help you.
My jacket's too small.
I got fired.
I asked Tom if he could make it by 2:30.
Tom was in the truck.
If Tom wants to go, I don't mind.
We're home today.
Tom works in Boston.
I just want to make you happy the way you want to make me happy.
I'll wait in the car.
Tom went to Boston by plane.
Tom was the one who told me about Mary's accident.
We're very efficient.
Please don't vote for her.
I'll deal with that later in the afternoon.
Tom bought a newspaper and read it on the train while he was at work.
You're very direct.
Tom pulled the cork out of the bottle.
And Tom will be there.
A guard is coming.
I can't confirm that.
Don't let me wait!
Tom gave me the picture that's hanging on the chimney.
The gulabics symbolize peace.
You don't want to go, do you?
That's why I like Tom.
Traitor!
I will do everything for the good of humanity.
Did you really stay home all night?
Jenna's music is beautiful.
Is she a cabbie?
I must be losing my hearing.
Now it's over.
I'm falling asleep.
It has not been scientifically proven that there is a relationship between character and blood type.
She sounded angry.
Frankly, Tom wasn't working hard enough.
He's from England.
Is there anyone who disagrees?
I don't like that part.
I think Tom is brave.
Try not to smoke too much.
Tom's a hairdresser.
I pressed the button to turn on the radio.
We're playing computer games.
Maybe you're right.
What are you holding?
This is a product for men.
We were looking for them everywhere.
I really like your web site.
I'll get you.
Push the button.
Tom really knows how to fight.
What's really bothering her?
Do you have the keys?
Tom smashed his car.
You have to overcome the difficulties.
Tom didn't want to break Mary's heart.
All lizards lay eggs.
We'll take something.
I think Tom's cruel.
You didn't answer my letter.
We've calmed down.
You look disoriented.
The bread is baked in the oven.
Let's find out what Tom wants.
I made the salad. Do you like it?
Two beers, please.
I'll help her tomorrow.
I see how things stand.
I make a lot of stupid decisions.
Let's move to that table.
Wait a second.
I just got a message from them.
Where's your family?
Where did Tom go?
This is very similar to mine.
I just ate, so I'm not hungry.
Please, get out.
His words sound reasonable.
There are many rivers in India.
Why don't we meet at 2:30?
I can't ask Tom for any more money.
Tom likes adventure.
They don't have a shed.
A lot of trees fell.
Lions don't distinguish colors.
That wasn't true.
The answer is crazy.
Tom wanted to go home early.
We're a long way from home.
Friendships last longer than memories.
Look over here.
I want you to give me my money back right now.
Tom believed Mary was innocent.
He's too proud.
I'm having a great time here in Vancouver.
Maybe we shouldn't be trying to do this without Tom's help.
Can I help you?
Tom and I are married now.
I guess we've both been lying.
I was happy here.
Only a few passengers survived the accident.
I can imagine you marrying Tom.
Tom's being polite.
Tom wants to know what Mary's doing in Boston.
I missed you so much.
I'm lower than you.
I'll quote you a paragraph from one of those letters.

My right ear is leaking pus.
Cardboard boxes are fragile.
My stomach hurts after meals.
We're really in danger.
Tom never told me he didn't speak French.
They don't have names.
It's fair.
I'm here to study.
I forgot to tell you about them.
Tom promised to stay in his room.
I'm pinning the calendar to the wall.
I really missed him.
I love you more than anyone has ever loved you.
We packed their suitcases.
What couldn't you sleep on last night?
They swore an oath to us.
Did you get the invitation from Tom?
Just turn it around.
You can't deny that.
That would be very funny.
This is for your own good.
Tom wasn't sure.
These aren't real.
Maybe I could talk to Tom.
What is the text about?
Tom wrote a letter to Mary and thanked her for her help.
I've decided to go.
They eat sandwiches.
Jellyfish live a long time.
Tom is a strong man.
Tom's sleeping really hard.
Are you helping him?
She looks like she's drunk.
You can talk to me later.
Buy her a drink.
Yeah, I remember.
Did you get here by car?
I don't know the end of the story.
It's all over.
I'm sure of it.
Will you wait a minute?
You're among friends.
You've weakened something.
I know you don't speak French.
Did you call him?
The question is who will make that decision.
They'll find him.
Start again.
It was a warm night.
Thanks for taking me in.
Susan is actually your half-sister.
I told Tom about you.
Tom, do you still love me?
I'd rather have eggs than a pod.
Can you explain that?
Where's his house?
Love is for fools.
Why would you help him?
Tom lit his shoes.
We have lost faith in humanity.
Tom shakes hands with the boss.
I was actually born in Boston.
And how am I to blame for that?
Why does everyone hate us?
Tom, lend me some money.
Am I interrupting you?
End violence; fight for peace.
See how I do it.
You're stronger than Tom.
Hold the candle.
Tom understands.
Well, just let me know.
Most of the plants died.
Hang on, Tom.
You're very helpful.
Tom still can't talk to us.
They're gonna have a lot of it.
I'm gay.
Let me see what I can do.
Tom likes cheese.
Do you mind if I honor you for dinner?
Tom wanted Mary to teach him how to swim.
I should take a look.
Come down, Dick, it's dinner time.
I'm running.
You were driving fast.
You can use my car.
Just relax.
Tom had one daughter.
Maybe Tom will at least apologize.
He's sneaking up on his boss.
The next morning, he found a handwritten letter in the mailbox.
Come on in.
Is anyone sitting here?
I have to cut my expenses this month.
No one's talking about us.
I think you're exaggerating the problem.
Have you already paid?
How could I hate Tom?
They'll be here soon.
Tom wiped his face.
What good do I get from you?
Let's take a closer look.
I love you more.
We don't have to follow her.
I get burned when I wear those clothes.
Suddenly, he changed the subject.
Nothing was funny.
I'm sure Tom agrees with me.
Now they live on the floor under this one.
They believed him.
I think they saw me.
Tom's parents didn't come to the wedding.
I tried to explain to him, but he didn't click.
I have to help her.
I already think you're crazy.
Dolphins are a type of mammal.
It's red.
Tom set me up.
Tom might be alive.
Will the future be like science fiction?
Tom's laughing at you.
I think I'm gonna go eat out.
He opened the door, even though I told him not to open it.
It narrows the choice.
It's not hard to stand out if you're surrounded by fools.
Tom asked us to look after his child.
I used the word “Alice” to describe it.
Third good luck.
We need to get rid of it.

No one said anything.
Let us strive for virtues and renounce vices.
You're clear.
I'm against projects.
Aren't you tired?
I know what the problem is.
Tom listened to Mary.
I'm a zombie!
I'm late.
I could tell Tom was really tired.
I never win.
Tom's pretty safe.
There are reports for writing.
It hurts here.
You're disturbing Tom.
Where are we headed?
I'll get it back from them.
Tell me why you didn't ask him.
Just be careful with that.
I was just teasing you.
Tom never showed up again.
My advice would be to get some sleep now and finish it tomorrow.
You jumped a button.
Illnesses often occur at the most inconvenient times.
A dog stares at me like he wants to eat me.
They were animals dressed in human skin, and they were not real people at all.
The man's hungry.
Tell him we're busy.
We wanted to talk about him.
Everything is fleeting, but the beautiful memories remain.
Say what you want.
What do you want to drink?
Tom says he can make any woman fall in love with him.
What did Tom think?
It was really nice.
They all die at some point.
I know how to stay calm.
We love the beauty.
I've been thinking about her all day.
I suggest we focus on the demand for a way out of the cave.
They have no confidence in me.

I got this fax from her.
Black cats bring bad luck.
Tom told me a secret.
We're flying over the clouds.
I like it very much!
Is this exactly in English?
Let's follow him.
Tom handed Mary a towel.
She's got ears like edra.
Give her a chair.
Where's your school?
Tom was sitting alone.
How's your wife?
Tom didn’t know how to answer the question.
This is a ginger drink.
Tom said he didn't know who to give it to.
I'm only eighteen.
What's wrong with your car?
Tom wondered what Mary would say.
I don't like what that sounds like.
That should be possible.
I'm a social worker.
Let me try it.
I'm not misunderstood,
Tom's safe.
I'll wait for Tom.
I assume you've read my report.
Tom's retired.
Don't repeat yourself.
The cherries are red.
Maybe we'll find something.
You look really good.
He's in a car accident, Tom.
Warm it up.
Tom looked like he was upset.
What else can Tom do?
I want to be physically and mentally stronger.
She's a cheerful girl.
If I could stay, I would stay.
Please, stop.
There's no hot water.
I bought you a dragon.

Do you have professional experience?
I wasn't asking you.

You are my pride and joy.
What would he say?
Make two lines.
The title should attract the attention of the readers.
He was sitting in front of me.
I'd rather die than obey.
I actually work here.
Tom's suffering.
I don't have to call anyone.
I like the way you're dressed.
I could stay with you.
It worked.
I watched a French movie with an English translation.
Tom was laughing at Mary.
He’s full of confidence again.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
My mother says that the child's illnesses are fake.
Dan had a tumultuous relationship with Linda.
They're all back.
Do you have a violin?
Call us.
Maybe Tom could sing to us at the wedding.

The hospital there isn't very big.
Most people have to work hard to survive.
Nothing ever changes.

A lot of people do this.
I still can't tell you.

"What book are you reading?" "Roman."
You burn the car.
That gun's not a toy, boy!
Half of the species are female.
They stare at him.
It's for them.
That's on Tom's dogs.
Where's the Vodka?
The room smelled bad.
I don't want to hate you.
I have to go again.
What's out there?
I saw her a week ago.
Don't talk to me.
I want to do a socially useful job of making amends for everything I’ve done.
Tom's got his tops on.
Are you still afraid of spiders?
I have no complaints.
I still don’t understand women.

Can I have one?
It’s not all milk and honey in Canada.
I have information on this subject.
Tom sneezed.
Do you understand the difference between what is right and what is wrong?
Don't be silly.
I still respect Tom.
Tom wouldn't trust anyone to do that.
His eyesight is weak.
That's my specialty.
I'm trying not to worry about you.
I had prepared a speech.
The falcons have a sharp appearance.
I wrote them that.
Last year I lived in Boston.

Tom laughed politely.
The teapot's pretty dirty.
You should get a good night's sleep.

Tell me where Tom is.
I don't mind.
Tell me again what happened.
Tom doesn't need a jigsaw.
He deserved better.
Don't give him your number.
Let's do it for her.
I'm not picking up the figs.
Do you think I care what you think of me?
She's been working since nine.
Can you just go home?
Do you know the right words?
I'm in terrible pain here.
I hate carpets.
I'm a little sick.
Tom stopped it.
Tom couldn't remember where he had left his umbrella.
Get out of the way.
I'll get my gun.
That's where you belong.
You're not too old for her.
That job is done.
It's unnatural.
What did he steal?
Tom will never finish the job he started.
Tom's a gentleman.
Do you have pets?
You were wrong about the picture.
I'll get it.

I stopped paying attention to Tom.
Did you know Tom was gonna be here?
The earthquake caused the fire.
Tom's not here today.
If I hadn't already eaten, I'd love to have lunch with you.
What do you need, Tom?
He would have said something.
The heater stopped working.
I'm talking about him.
Tom knew he would never see Mary again.
Drop the weapon, get on the ground.
And I'll see you tomorrow?
I'm the one you want.
We bought those books.
That's quite possible.

It's kind of wet.
It was a wonderful experience.

Can I put this in here?
I didn't see anyone.
I'll take you home.

Let's go wake Tom up.
How do I find him?
The ice has melted.
I spilled blood.
You're after them.
What can you tell us about him?
Why did you attack them?
I'm afraid of dogs.
Tom asked Mary to bring him a cup of coffee.
I always get up early.
It must have been very easy for you.

Do you want to go to work?
I couldn't stand him.

I'm thirsty for him.
He's hanging out at home.
I'm not even sure I remember exactly.
Tom noticed how Mary looked at him.
You're giving me a lot of strength.
Ask him to explain.
It's still working.
Tom's a nice guy.
The eagle is the king of birds.
I'll call you later.
This is blackmail.
Why don't you rest?
You didn't ask why.
Tom didn't sound as excited as Mary.
Let's talk.
I think Tom's fine.
The sky has cooled.
Galamata will wake the baby.
Just look straight ahead.
That’s not something a person should be prepared for.
Tom and Mary play rhymes.
I've made up my mind.
Take care of our planet.
Tom leaned on Mary.
I'll call security.
Tom, you think you'd rather have a son.
How did you get here?
He picked up the book.
Don't grab my guitar.
He's very kind, just like you.
I'm gonna go do that.
Tom reads Mary's secret diary.
The priest will take some of the blood.
We talked until two o'clock.
I found out about you from him.
I know you're upset right now.
He's gone.
The long walk gave him an appetite.
I have to go help her.
Tom served himself a cup of tea and a doughnut.
Tom could tell you.
There's just no way I can get Tom to swim.
When did you visit Boston?
Isn't that enough?
I wanted to tell you how it was done, but Tom asked me not to tell you.
They both smiled again.
My wedding must be perfect.
Tom was feeling strong.
The meeting has already begun.
We want to hear it.
I really like what your hair looks like.
Is it cold outside?
You should go to bed early.
Tom sensed danger.
He is addicted to pornography.
It's just stupid.
Tom is an expert.
This is the big one.
Why can't you help me?
Your hair is broken.
Tom is the tallest man in the class.
Tom, you've grown up so fast.
That was our only consolation.
No one would care.
Did you write in a journal today?
I just want this to never happen again.
Can I do it alone?
Is yours on the radio?
Tom died three weeks before I got out of prison.
We'll call him.
Tom tried to look through the lock, but he couldn't see anything.
I couldn't stand it.
I've known the deceased for a long time.
We can't get into that right now.
Why are you blaming me?
Come on, Tom.
I'll just try to get there in time.
No one came here.
I know there's something here.
Drinking dirty water can cause illness.
Up and down, we're ready.
Tom has a keen ear.
I bribed them.
I told you I couldn't.
Tom's books have been translated into many languages.
I'm not comfortable with him.
Tom stole your money.
Don't pull the plug.
I helped him open the table.
I ate a potato schnitzel last night.
It's better for your health to go up the stairs.
Tom bought a coat.
We gave them a sedative.
Your faith is bad.
I'm sorry I ever said anything to them.
I wouldn't have asked you if I could have found someone else.
Pick me up at two and a half.
Tom squeals.
I slept in the closet.
I kind of enjoyed it.
That's exactly what it can do.
Aren't you cold on short sleeves?
Tom is the best.
He's got an eye for art.
It was the worst party I've ever been to.
I need an envelope.
Tom is rarely late.
He didn't answer my question.
Do you know any ass-kicking Japanese movies?
Did you catch them?
The French language was first slang.
Don't you ever call her?
We baked them cakes.
The fingerprints on the knife determine her culpability.
Can I wait for them here?
We can search in the dictionary.
Go find him.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me!
We need guidance.
It was ironic.
I baked you cookies.
That can be done.
Italian cops are driving me crazy.
Maybe I should help them.
I forwarded to Tom the schedule you sent me.
It's not expensive.
It's a real shame.
Having too many books to read is a good thing.
We'd have fun going to the party.
Don't save the bell.
You've got me covered.
You have to be careful.
Tom's acting out of order.
You forget, your youth continues.
You're free.
Your role here is so important.
Tom sent me these.
Who's your lawyer?
Tom looks lonely.
How come you don't know?
That was a surprise.
Do you really think you can get here by 2:30?
I'll be in my lab.
Meat doesn't smell good.
Demek, should I know you?
Tom cleverly covered up all his mistakes.
Let me take care of you.
He can't come because he's sick.
No connection, I guess.
She's running slowly.
How can you be so sure?
In the picture you can see bottles of various vegetable oils.
They live in trouble.
Tom's fat.
Tom said it's time to eat.
I don't want to swim.
We just blew out Tom's room last week.
Tom doesn't sleep in a coffin, unlike most vampires.
I'd sell a dog if it was higher.
I'm going to help my friends.
Turns out there's no air from Dan.
Nothing here is mine.
My son loves rockets.
You need to hurry up.
Everybody's talking.
Oh, what is this?
Tom's a slob.
We despise her.
He got in front of them.
Here, brother, half way.
Tom sent the new moustache to the table that he had just bought.
Tom's going to help Mary.
She grew up in an orphanage.
Tom's got a fever.
The landscape is excellent.
It's locked.
I found your slippers under the bed.
I can't get in there.
We need to test it.
Freedom of expression was severely restricted.
We're gonna have to hurry.
Tom celebrated the victory with wine.
We don't have a whole week.
I'll try to restrain myself.
Autumn is here.
Tom wanted to unpack.
Tom bought a straw hat.
Did you cause the traffic?
The water only takes three minutes to boil.
They could fire me for this.
What's the intention?
Tell me where to find him.
You're drunk!
It was so grand.
Dan was in a relationship with Linda for a very short time.
It is impossible for me to answer the question.
I want to take a course.
All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should treat each other in the spirit of universal human belonging.
What happened was an accident.
This building has a thunderbolt.
They kissed.
I have a friend.
Tom wants to do it alone.
What's the best?
I'm making a snowman.
Have you seen how it works?
The soup is salted.
Why don't you go pick him up?
Tom continued to exercise.
Try to understand.
It won't cost you anything to fix it.
Does that mean "yes" or "no"?
Tom stared into the tunnel.
How can you want to be my friend, don't you see how poor I am?
I think it's familiar.
I envy him.
I offered to suck his dick, but he said he wasn't in the mood.
There's someone in the tunnel.
Everything has its limits.
With all that noise, I couldn't sleep last night.
Basil, sage, rosemary, thyme and oregano are popular herbs.
We're lazy.
You're an insightful man.
Everything seemed fine.
Leave this here.
He sat on the bench.
Ignorance always creates fear.
They don't pay me much.
I know you like me.
The door opened.
That doesn't sound good enough.
I'm going to the park.
You'll find your toys and your books.
My brother and I shared a room.
I knew Tom couldn't be trusted.
I know how to keep secrets.
I don't want to run.
So I'm kind of flattered even.
I'm practising.
She may have lied to you, but I'm not!
Let's just get the fog.
Forget what I said.
Give him the whole thing.
They got me.
Tom put his hand in the bag and pulled out a few coins.
The room was a cupcake.
It is easy to solve this task.
They have to remove the bullet that was stuck to his spine.
It's so much fun.
Does Tom look upset?
If you can, this weekend.
I know what it probably sounds like to you.
One of the suitcases is completely empty.
I'm so sorry, but I seem to have lost your umbrella.
I don't have a sword.
The suspect confessed.
Maybe you could be my roommate.
We're good.
You don't seem to know how much it hurts to be alone.
We're importing grain from the United States.
Here's how I wrote it.
I've never seen a fat vegan.
I need paper, pencils, ink and so on.
I don't know how Tom did it, but he did it.
Tom's gone because he's sick.
Cats have the ability to see in the dark.
Tom is busy with his research.
The wipers don't help against the ice.
I was beautiful.
Why are there people in the room?
I have a question for her.
What would you like to ask Tom?
Wait for them.
I guess it doesn't make sense to ask Tom.
My brother will be here tomorrow, Saturday.
You don’t have to like everything.
Are the potatoes caloric?
They'll get it soon enough.
We made mistakes.
Tom pulled Mary for the tail.
I broke the vase today.
That's what I'm worried about.
I'll go ask him.
You're lucky I didn't bite you.
You're wrong, Tom.
This imbecile has sharp teeth.
How serious are you?
There's nothing to think about.
I'd like to make some makeup for him.
I was waiting outside.
You're impressive.
You need to grow up and mature a little.
Tom came here from Boston.
I was lucky.
Take me to the Hilton Hotel.
Can I have your name and phone number?
Tom was hitting me with a rock.
Everybody knows about her.
Thank you for helping us.
What's so angry, Tom?
Tom will be here for a few days.
I hope we're the last ones.
They were standing under the street in front of the store to avoid the rain.
I remember a few reasons.
Tom became a father.
They were weak.
Tom didn't even know Mary had cancer.
It was my mistake.
They hired me to find them.
They didn't find her.
I don't quite understand.
Tom was persistent.
He didn't go there.
I need to break your neck.
Why would he be upset?
I'm comfortable here.
One of us can help him.
I'm gonna go check on Tom.
That's a nice jacket.
I like your coffee.
They all hesitated.
I'm still thinking about her.
Today I learned that there is a movie called “The Russians are coming! The Russians are coming!”
I want you to help her.
You're one of us.
I wonder if Tom knows why Mary was absent from school yesterday.
I enjoy long walks on the beach.
Maybe I should go.
Oh, thanks.
Let's say you're right.
It's nice and warm.
Tom is still not able to write his name?
Tom put the diary in the drawer.
Give him a chance.
I'm paying.
How many days until Christmas?
I wouldn't blame you.
Do you think Tom's in trouble?
I don't like that.
Tom has a collection of grandmothers.
She was making tea.
Thank you for yesterday.
You got enough?
Mice are carriers of the plague.
I'll call him in a minute.
Tom's squealing.
I'll start tomorrow.
I wasn't being honest with myself.
I've been looking for you for a while.
What do you want me to ask them?
I can't write that well.
The king did not foresee the fall of the monarchy.
I'm eating from Tom.
I want roasted chestnuts.
What did Tom do here?
He fell asleep while driving, causing a traffic jam.
They're hugging us.
Tom told Mary not to go.
We can't prove that.
It was so beautiful.
Tom greets Mary with a wave.
That's all right.
Tom seems worried.
Tom and Mary were my friends.
That would be weird.
Don't panic too much.
I'd like to do that.
How is the camera used?
It was snowing last night.
I didn't want to tell you.
They're interesting people.
I think I speak French pretty well.
Be careful not to overdo it.
Tom's a bookkeeper.
Don't tell me what my responsibilities are.
Do you need help with anything?
It's so beautiful.
I don't speak English, not German.
It'll take us about three hours to get off the mountain.
I'm just starving.
I was disqualified.
Did you finish packing?
I knew you'd find me.
Tom's recovering.
Why would Tom do that?
Who are you with?
Let's talk about it.
Let's not get carried away.
I'm not gonna help you.
Tom remembers you.
I'm inclined to believe you.
You care too much about him.
The president has announced that the United States will launch a satellite into orbit.
I can't borrow your book.
It's impossible to get out of the cell.
I want to be sweet.
Tom helped me a little.
Am I here too soon?
That sounds really strong.
Tom looked up at me.
Tom's old-fashioned.
Is this in place?
Do you want to stop?
Take care, Tom.
Tom's got his tops on.
I can't turn it off.
We weren't supposed to stay awake until 2:30.
You really do.
Do you think we should give up?
That's not reasonable.
Women in the United States do not have the right to vote.
My neighbor called the fire department.
Tom said I should talk to someone about what happened.
The trees are green.
Tom's dying.
Tom was very open.
Did the dog give it to him?
Tom doesn't listen to us.
Tom's a big boy now.
Did Tom break your heart?
Was that all the excitement?
Tom wandered off somewhere.
I'll be back in less than a second.
The alarm clock is ringing.
I'm sorry I didn't give you more support.
Is there any objection?
Tom was lying on his back.
Where's the bathroom?
I'll stay here.
I wonder why they chose him.
That's an undisputed fact.
Is it delicious?
Watch out!
We should give Tom a chance to confess.
The sky is clear.
We don't talk much.
You're a loving man.
Tom's a little squeaky.
I'm at the airport.
I prefer the black one.
Tom has given up on his destiny.
I don't need it now.
Tokyo is similar to Bogota, and Osaka is similar to Medellin.
Did you stop beating your wife?
This is a mistake.
Why didn't you stop Tom?
I said I'd bring it.
Survivors are a kind of mammals.
I'll start.
To call the elevator, press the button.
I'm making soup in a big pot.
If I meet Jesus, I'll examine his stomach.
There's nothing we can do for you.
I'll sell you this if you're willing to pay the price.
Where's the wheel going?
You wiped your wet hair with a towel.
If an adult is lying to a child, he thinks he is always right.
Wow, it's really late.
You'll be in danger.
Try your luck! Try your luck!
I may not graduate.
That's very interesting, Tom.
I've heard of it.
Tom pulled a screwdriver out of the toolbox.
Grab the rope.
I hope you enjoy this sentence.
Dan decorated the walls of his room with racist symbols.
Tom waved his hands.
Open the notebooks.
You can't let that happen.
Tom opened the window.
Tom wanted Mary to play tennis with him.
I'll do everything.
Tom turned to the next question.
That was very thoughtful.
I want life.
Tom's not in his bed.
It was all my idea.
I don't want riddles.
This book will help you write well.
This area is located in the valley.
Do you really want to stay until Monday?
I didn't think you'd be busy.
That's not scary.
I hope Tom finds happiness in his life.
You said we'd never catch her.
Stop talking about her.
I sent Tom to Boston between me.
Please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please,
I was ready for you.
Her classmates made fun of her.
Excuse me, I'm looking for him.
Tom said he'd seen Mary on the left.
I'm having fun tossing my toasts with honey.
They tasted the bread.
I didn't get the job.
I have a lot of land.
The area is very isolated.
I'm guessing the parrot escaped from the cage.
We went to get strawberries.
We live on planet Earth.
I love sunflowers.
I needed the money.
Go help them.
It's not absurd.
You'll get them back.
Tom threw out his girlfriend.
Just give it to Tom.
No one's impressed.
I almost wouldn't come.
I made a cake.
Look at the number.
I was impressed by your design.
You told me to call you any time.
What is that sound?
I want to ask you about her.
I built it.
Turn everything off.
Tom suffocated.
They think we're a gang.
I'm just watching TV.
Hi, how are you?
Last month I had a bladder infection.
Look at the girls.
I'll take the kilos.
That’s what happened before.
I have my own theory.
I love foreign languages.
And Tom can help you.
I wonder why we got married.
What's the use of that?
I’m with the person I want to be with.
He invited me to his wedding.
Tom just got fired.
Now you can sit down.
But I didn't see anything.
"How are you?" "Okay, thank you!"
Mary was a lovely bride.
Tom should be ashamed.
Wait a minute, Tom.
For me, every Finnish sentence is a quick one.
The lock's broken.
Give me a few minutes and I'll find out what's going on.
Where do you want us to go?
We didn't do anything wrong.
When was the last time you visited Boston?
Tom and Mary might agree.
Why did you leave me?
I don't want spring.
Everyone has to stay.
We were just confused.
You're not Japanese.
Tom has a lot of good qualities.
Go to the others.
Well, that's good.
You should eat more.
Tom doesn't like sports.
Shouldn't we be helping them?
I didn't feel sorry for them.
Tom feels he needs to be redeemed.
The message is for them.
When do I get there?
Tom opened the box.
Let's buy this.
Tom picked up the knife.
The war lasted two years.
That's all I'm gonna say.
I'm not your shoulder.
The company fired five people.
I should sue him.
Tom was here.
We're not hanging out.
Where's the mailbox?
The internet is a serious business.
Mars is the red planet.
He waved the dog with a stone.
Tom stared hard.
It's seven o'clock already.
I'm curious.
We can try.
Demek wrote the book himself!
Don't put so much pepper in the soup.
Let's not be imaginary.
They looked around.
Tom looked out the window and saw Mary playing with her dog.
Tom got drunk last night.
I asked her to come with me.
We need help from Tom.
They were pleased.
How can we help?
In order to prepare the soil for planting, you have to drain it.
Tom's not feeling well today.
We're not looking.
Mahmud can't bear to lose.
No one listens to you.
All right, convince me.
I'm ready for him now.
It's not possible!
Tom missed the bus.
Forgetfulness and hate usually go hand in hand.
Tom didn't know that had happened.
I'm at the library.
My pants are off.
I asked them what was wrong.
I don't want to make you uncomfortable.
If I had wings, I'd fly you.
I agreed.
Tom admits to spilling red wine.
You want a puppy?
I live near the dam.
You're all cowards.
It's not wrong.
Honesty is virtue.
Bush respects human rights.
They broke the rules.
Have you heard of us?
We visited the castles of the Loire.
Tom's a hopeless case.
It's a little ahead.
I think of him every day.
I'll help you find Tom.
We're almost there.
I realized I hadn't eaten yet.
I'd be happy to keep it.
You knew, didn't you?
All your stuff is here.
Stay as long as you want.
Just hold my hand.
I shouldn't have trusted her.
Who would know that?
I can't get into that.
Tom knows a lot of famous people.
He's very meticulous in his work.
Come to the house.
Why is music so much fun to listen to?
They found them, didn't they?
Who did that?
You're not alone.
I remember you were in Boston for a short time.
How many stomachs should I make per day?
Are you gonna cry?
Tom turned to leave.
Tom's nice.
How was the party yesterday?
Give us the keys.
Would you like to come here and watch a movie?
Dan decided to travel the world.
This is nonsense.
I hate to do this.
Dan turned into a questioner.
You've got a lot of piercing eyes.
Isn't that what it means?
I thought he was tired.
How long do I have to wait?
Take Tom to town.
We need to let Tom get back to work.
I want you to shoot them all.
I think I write pretty well.
Are you going back to work?
I'll be with you soon.
Touch and go inside.
Don't fire them.
You need a friend.
Tom seems rich.
Tom seems more confident.
Would you like to drink some water?
Tom's not friendly.
However, the quantity is not accurate.
They'll probably never see each other again.
Tell me a little about him.
I want to learn.
Tom wanted Mary to come to his party.
Squares have four corners.
I kept working.
They develop dependence.
Would you like me to come with you?
We'll wait there.
Can you check those?
Give them a second.
They sat and were silent.
Bring the shovel.
You have many different kinds of people here.
Mary moved on to her mother.
Pick one.
What do they want with me?
No one was listening to Tom.
Do you want me to get something from the supermarket?
Finish the table.
Tom wiped the knife blade from the jeans.
Tom was trying to stay focused.
Tom has a long beard.
One of them called me.
I can arrange for that to happen.
Are your noses bleeding?
Just let me hear from her, okay?
Tom put his jar of beer on the bar.
The devil is a squirrel.
I didn't say I speak French.
Give me a seductive look.
Come on, don't be shy.
I wouldn't want to eat meat from a cloned animal.
How far have you gone?
My father is very strict.
Maybe I'd better come back later.
What do tigers eat?
I'll just buy another one.
Will you come down?
Give him a dollar.
Was there an autopsy?
Tom's lying.
Explain to me how this is possible.
He looked at me through the glasses.
Linda told Dan he'd beaten her up.
Why would they put a stop to that?
Let's not bother Tom.
The rope is durable.
I just need a break.
I have an order for Tom.
I couldn't do that.
There's yours.
We didn't want that to happen.
This is very unusual.
Did you buy these for them?
I want you to behave properly.
I need to get rid of us.
Why is the sky blue?
Where are Tom's keys?
Did Tom get hurt?
Who could have broken the aquarium?
It came through my head.
Tell me what I'm looking for here.
Tom has struggled with depression for many periods of his life.
Shall I take your bags?
I would have trusted my life with that.
I'm kind of hungry.
I'll try.
What do you have to worry about?
I need dinner.
It wouldn't matter.
Tom didn't tell me who his French teacher was.
Class sucks.
There were penguin feet on the sand.
Tom just left.
Dan called for a hitchhiker.
I want to comb my hair.
I respect the decision you made.
It is obvious to everyone that he is in love.
You can eat as much as you want.
We can do this.
We'll follow him.
Can you guess what this is?
Move it.
I don't speak fast.
We need to talk in four eyes.
Tom's not thrilled.
I'm not even sure he likes me.
Hey, you can't sleep there.
I live in a small town near Boston.
I hope the new boss likes you.
Did you mention the results of the test?
If you want quality, pay.
Tom was starving.
She studied English.
With such a vivid dream, he will become either a famous writer or a madman.
We both hate her.
They're starting to beat her.
Tom opened the windows in the bedroom.
Don't even talk to me.
We're gonna get through this.
We're here to apologize.
We are going to visit our brothers and sisters.
I don't want to end up poor.
Let's do something.
The Nazis burned books.
Why are you calling me?
Tom spit out his chewing gum.
Let it be mine.
I bought them something.
Mother, thank you for giving birth to me.
Who recommended that?
How'd you do that?
I thought Tom might not want to go with us.
I finally beat him.
How easy it is to get into bad habits!
She's starting to act weird.
They probably won't pay back the money.
You can't marry Tom.
Dan asked Linda how her interest in archaeology was born.
Tom heard the sound.
Why didn't you listen to Tom?
Who do you think will know the answer?
What do we do next?
We want to help him.
Tom used to eat meat.
You always get me wrong.
We're just as strong with you.
The president looked strong.
What to buy?
Tom went to the window and looked out.
His cell phone was stolen.
I'm sad.
I'm gonna be in Boston all week.
Tom couldn't do what he wanted.
I thought you played chess better than me.
Is the bridge safe?
Give us an example.
Kennedy was talking about the problem.
I came here yesterday.
Tom said Mary was a Canadian.
I know Tom's widow.
Tom helped me.
We tried to get them to come.
I'm not gonna say that again.
Turn off the lights.
I need a clean shirt.
If people are scared enough, anything can happen.
You're close.
He ran as fast as he could.
Is Tom back?
Tom's neck is stiff.
Grab the day.
What's ringing Tom?
He's very handsome.
Be careful with the buyer.
Tom often runs away from class.
Now is the time for compensation.
Most virgins have a full hymen.
You can come out at the end.
Why did you only fry two sausages?
When I give food to the poor, they call me a saint, when I ask why the poor have no food, they call me a communist.
I don't care about that.
I wonder what's for dinner.
Tom is interested in French history.
Because the bus had stopped, we had been waiting for the rain for a long time.
You're gonna make it.
Does she have a dog?
I've had a rest.
Mary was wearing false eyelashes.
Here's how I did it.
I've always wanted to get to one of these.
I'll help you find him.
Tom thought he was speaking more French than he really was.
How much time do I have?
It's almost summer.
Maria didn't understand the lecture. The speaker was supposed to speak slowly.
Looks like we're the only ones here today.
My shoes are soaked.
The medication calmed the patient.
Tom's next crime will be his last.
Please accept the job offer.
I wonder why this is happening.
I don't want to look stupid.
His mother is American.
Relax a little.
Is Tom amused?
Tom and Mary don't even know each other.
The sphinx started circling around him.
We need your help to find her.
The bread is mulled, which means we can't eat it anymore.
Tom missed the party.
Tom Fuscher did the job.
Tom closed the drawer.
Tom looked upset.
Please tell them what to do.
Bacteria are microscopic organisms.
It's up to me, Tom.
Don't listen to the boss blindly.
I've been looking for him for a while.
It's good work.
Tom got sick.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom's always liked you.
Now we'll never know.
Shall we wait for him here?
Enjoy the day.
Tom's just freaked out.
I prefer goat's cheese to cow's cheese.
We understand that.
How is that different?
I thought you were planning on staying in bed all day.
I haven't eaten dairy in a long time.
I'll be able to see you next year.
That was our plan.
I'm stuck here in Boston.
Have you met Tom?
Are they all having fun?
I've been up all night.
I have unfinished business with Tom.
Did that happen to you?
I know it's your place.
Tom reminded Mary to renew her driver's license.
It was creepy.
The carpenters cut down a tree.
I think you've been here before.
That's all I needed.
Where were you born?
Zini's done.
Same-sex couples should not be allowed to get married.
The cow forgot it was once a calf.
Give them the picture.
Tom was buried alive.
Sewing is a hand job.
Let's go see Tom.
I'm very confused.
Tom, if there's a problem, I want to know.
Give me a few seconds.
Let's just get her out of here.
I saw my sister drop the letter.
Let me try that.
Could you put the cigarette out?
What were they laughing at?
Why would I trust her?
Who's the girl sitting there?
I didn't know about them.
My stomach hurts.
Look at this place.
I want to be a taxi driver.
There's still no sign of Tom.
I was at home then.
Don't push me.
I'll see you later, okay?
I want to live in New Delhi.
Let's talk.
The alligator ate the dog.
Lies give birth to other ships.
I don't have any more money.
The chair is plastic.
Sunlight is said to be the best means of disinfection.
You'll get a copy.
I need to feed them.
She's always soulless.
They're serious.
Tom knew he didn't speak French as well as Mary.
That was very helpful.
Lift me up.
Did you call an ambulance already?
After lunch, we went for a walk in the park.
You have to answer the question.
The red light is on.
John's at the airport.
Tom was supposed to be ready an hour ago.
Let your conscience bite you now.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
The first snow fell today.
Its charm is indescribable.
I'm at work tomorrow.
How much did you bet?
We need it now.
I don't know what you're looking for here.
Blood circulates throughout the body.
I'll make him go.
This is a vertical line.
It always smells like mayonnaise.
It won't help lies.
My right toe hurts.
Apples are healthy.
I wanted to be just like Tom.
What can you tell me about him?
I have to buy them gifts.
What would the prince want?
Where did we come from? Where did we go?
I really don't know.
Do you have a napkin?
Tom is paying attention.
Dan had no sympathy for any human being.
When did Tom arrive?
Can I leave her a message?
I gave that order six hours ago.
Look at the drawing.
Their houses were built of stone.
Yeah, I said that, but I wasn't right.
I think we should talk about this now.
The meetings were held at intervals.
Tom seemed so happy.
I don't speak English, let alone Spanish.
What are you doing with this?
No one's gonna bother you.
Tom didn't even think about that.
There's wind.
I'm just joking with you.
I don't know where that is.
We've all noticed that.
I'm one of your students.
And I bought a wristwatch.
Just sit there.
Tom barely knows how to walk.
Didn't you say you wanted to go with us?
I expect visitors.
They saved the whole team.
At what age did you start menstruating?
You're teasing me.
But not in front of the choir.
The company went bankrupt.
I'm twelve years old.
I'm focusing.
Tom's not very talkative.
You were right, guys.
It's happening.
There were no other injured.
I decided to go by train.
I'm sure you'll make it.
Are you going to eat at home or out?
I have three cousins.
If I eat more, I'll get sick.
Are you making fun of me?
I think I know him.
I drink milk.
Don't get mad, Tom.
It's a painful task.
You should make him listen.
I was surprised it was so easy.
Let's just say he was here.
Tom wasn't hungry.
Tom often calls Mary.
Thank you, darling.
They increased the territory of the empire.
I didn't come here to hurt people.
Tom probably already knew about it.
My mother and sister are my aunts.
I've been looking for them everywhere.
Tom's incapacitated.
My school has a band.
Tom can't deny that.
It went red.
I have to go.
Anyone who sleeps with dogs wakes up with fleas.
His aunt's all alone in London.
It's not a big miracle.
I'm sick.
This neighborhood is very lonely.
Maybe he'll come back tonight.
I fixed his radio.
This is a leather belt.
Tom had a cold.
When did I try to give you money?
How's your mother?
It doesn't matter.
Hey, listen.
Tom says he can pay for it.
She didn't show up.
I'll admit it.
I'll ask him on your behalf.
Don't tell my mother.
You can avoid such problems if you have these tips in mind.
His excuse is far from perfect.
I hope we beat Tom.
Put your things away.
Where'd you put it?
Tom doesn't know how to accept defeat.
Tom's my husband.
What do I get out of that?
Don't you think Cookie would be a good name for a dog?
Tom wasn't too busy.
Tom told me he'd be back by the end of the week.
I want a room for one man.
You don't have to be there for this.
Do you have any idea where Tom might be?
He asked for a beer.
Let's not ruin that.
You're very passionate.
I've had a headache.
I don't like that word.
Earth, Mars and Jupiter are planets.
Do you want me to ask him?
Give Tom a handkerchief.
The weather here is very unpredictable.
Is she really that pretty?
Hey, don't let it be your fault.
Isn't that unusual?
I leaned against the wall.
The clock is broken.
Tom has to be stopped.
Isn't that excessive?
They know what happened.
Tom unwraps the scarf from his face.
Your hair smells like spring.
The tower was in ruins.
He is a great materialist.
Tom says he's rich.
Just relax a little bit.
Have you read it?
I thought you might be interested in finding out.
Give me the claws.
The Hawaiians love cold weather.
This is a little loose on my waist.
Tom never lived in Boston.
Have you forgiven me yet?
Did Tom know?
Would Tom lie to you?
I'm not even tired.
She's afraid of losing money.
Tom swallowed the bull.
Canada produces good wheat.
He loves his father very much.
Let's go upstairs.
It's not like we're doing anything.
Tom had a good time today.
Milton hasn't slept well in a week.
When is the big day?
I worked for him.
How long did Tom say he planned to stay with us?
Give him everything we have.
It's no secret that Tom disagrees with you.
Tom's still in bed.
What are you up to?
Now this is your house.
Would you like to try some sushi?
How are you doing?
I feel better.
What's the difference?
I wish I could live my life doing what I want.
It's not my decision.
Despite our expectations, there were no charges.
It is one of the Seven Deadly Sins.
Tom is irresponsible.
I have always wanted to be a teacher.

Tom helped us escape.
Tom had an accident.
Tom drove Mary home.
I ski often.
I'll get the beer.
What other reason could there be?
Did you see anyone?
I have to be free.
I'm just as qualified as Tom.
When's my turn?
Tom didn't make it.
I'm a new student.
The baby's asleep.
How rich is Tom?
It's obviously a typo.
It's not often that someone buys a hat for a thousand dollars.
Will the police come?
We have to find him first.
Dan made fun of the assistants with his comments.
You don't have to go.
I barely managed to get caught.
I can't interfere.
You beat them.
They're silent.
Tom is back soon.
I'd be for it.
History is written by the winners.
Tom was the only one on the ship when it exploded.
Who's going to make up for the zeitgeist?
Tom doesn't like the house he lives in.
Nothing's bothering me here.
He cheated on me.
That's the glory of it.
Nothing is sacred.
Tom seems to be very proud of himself.
Actually, no one knows.
Give me the shovel.
She's here.
He was looking for the key.
This is bad for the environment.
We're breaking it.
Do we have a choice?
I don't know why I reacted that way.
I was in three places.
I'm here to talk about her.
We have fish for dinner today.
I don't eat in restaurants very often.
Do we have any food?
Tom's almost there.
You seem to have an infection.
I can't think of anything smarter.
The sky is red in the dark.
I'm here to wish you luck.
I'd love for you to come, too.
They must be happy.
We need to fix this.
I don't speak English very well.
We'll deal with it.
Bread is made from flour.
Where's the guy who beat them?
Dan understood this very well.
You want a cookie?
Who brought this?
I told them when I saw them, and I told him.
Dan might have had a fight with Linda.
There was silence in the room.
Everybody loves him.
Tom was driving like a maniac.
It was a tough test.
It's hot in hell.
I've seen it.
This is your business!
Please come back to me.
It's cold in here.
To congratulate you on your wedding.
Kids, stay here.
We need your help.
Let's just go find them.
Go to Tom's house.
Is your dog barking?
That's great.
The palace has a high tower.
The kids have homework.
Let's go get them.
She's a teacher.
The hard question is how.
You have to ask them first.
I made a phone call.
Tom walked away.
I'm not sure Tom was the one who did it.
Tom wasn't asleep.
I won't mind if you go.
Tom himself came here.
I forgot my scarf.
We've suffered a lot.
Tom wanted everyone to think he was dead.
Scientific research often calls for difficult compromises.
Tom just pulled out his prostheses.
I have to try to find him.
I took care of it.
Tell me the details.

I hate that trumpet.
The doctor gave her a sedative.
Does Tom look like a man who's afraid of someone?
What happened to Tom and Mary?
I think Tom might have a boyfriend.
I love you as you are.
It's funny.
It's very relaxing.
Keep your weapons ready.
We had our reasons.
His reputation was in jeopardy.
Let's just say I didn't do it.
Let me help you with that.
I stole it from them.
Why doesn't anyone want to help us?
The hole is narrow.
You should go help him.
Do you enjoy that?
I had a great time tonight.
Tom was in the cabin.
Tom made a sound.
Tom and Mary are waiting for you on the porch.
It's nice of him to bring gifts like that.
I embarrassed him.
Shut up or they'll throw you out.
Get out of the way.
Let's get started!
How long is the road?
I'm fine, thanks!
Don't be late for the meeting tomorrow.
That's the message.
It's starting to get dark.
Tom was educated.
I'm surprised Tom left with Mary.
He has been blind since birth.
The book contains fifteen biographies.
Tom's been working all night.
Tom was just here.
I gave up.
How long have you been waiting?
Socks and shoes are new.
I haven't had a pizza in a while.
Something wouldn't make me happier.
I suggest you learn more.

How are you two?
Dalida died of an overdose of sleeping pills.
His opinions are worthless.
Sign below, please.
Tell me where to find her.
It was really good.
Did you know Tom lived in Boston?
I only wore one pair of shoes.
You don't want to do something that reminds them that you're actually not big enough to be here.
I won the lottery.
We could talk about music.
I slept like a butcher.
I have faith in myself.
Tom's here, isn't he?
Oh, my God, he's back.
Ish, jukebox!
They sipped in the water.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom speaks French better than you think.
Let's all help them.
This is a glass mosaic.

I think we've had enough.
This is very difficult for them.

Tom taught me how to make pancakes.
The one who washes the car is Mr. Jones.
Tom looks suffocated.
Isn't that the guy who wants to buy your house?
I know Tom's in Boston now.
That's her.
I can transport you.
Is Tom safe?
However, there is a solution.
You're disorganized.
I'm trying.
I'm sure Tom can handle it this way.
I don't think I've ever been that scared.
Can you do the job?
We have to get back to him.
You're uncultured.
Do you do sports?
It just sounds boring.
Bring it in.
Tom lied to me all the time.
Tom didn't say he'd help us.
Tom took the knife.
The people in Madrid are crazy.
That's completely inaccurate.
I'd better call her first.
He's very social.
Tom can't wait any longer.
I exercise just to look good when I'm naked.
A thousand years is a thousand years.
I'll put it on your account.
I'm planning to visit Tom in Boston next weekend.
I didn't expect you to do that for Tom.
That's an honest word.
We have three guards working alternately.
We can't stay together, it wasn't even written.
Visitors are welcome.
Could you introduce me in a few words?
Tom was present.
I want you to call them.
Bring your toolbox.
Does Tom contribute?
This is a bit of a shame.
We were both busy.
I'm three hours away.
I want crosswords.
I expected them to be here.
Tom took a picture of this.
Tom closed his mouth.
Don't you hate him?
Stop behaving like a child.
Tom's not a bad guy.
He never hired them.
I want cake.
We didn't do anything for them.
I'm trying to help Tom.
Tom's a retired dentist.
That was very nice.
I'm going to hide.
I think I'm a pretty normal guy.
He will soon be leaving his parents' house.
Tom resisted.
The scars are barely visible.
Tom's a dwarf.
I'll take you home.

Was Tom in Boston last week?
I am used to speaking in public.
She was crying out of luck.
Tom got out of jail.
I'm glad I'm working here.
Where did Tom say he wanted to go?
I'm waiting for the light to go green.
Do you want me to rub your shoulders?
It's on my head.
I hesitated with my head.
Tom told me he was planning on going to Boston.
Tom never gets sick.
But that's a completely different story.
Who's your best friend?
The next night, I didn't sleep well.
I'm going to the end.
I'm going to change my clothes.
He put my earphone down.
It might have sounded like a suggestion, but it was an order.
Maybe I should just tell Tom I want my money back today.
You'd make a great mother.
Tom continued to work.
Please find my head.
Why did they choose them?
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?
Tom doesn't agree.
They rejected our first proposal.
Sooner or later, I'm going to break the movie.
Can you just give me a minute?
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever

I baked them a cake.
Tom is very patient.
Let's get started.
Come alone.

Isn't that good news?
Let's assume she was here.
Tom always makes me angry.
Tom's just watching.
Here's today's schedule.
Tom didn't wait.
I want to eat pizza.
Tom is an architect.
There were candles everywhere.
I finally found you.
That was my suitcase.
The toy is made of wood.
Thanks in advance.
The question is, what are you going to do?
Tom told Mary that he loved her.
Well, we're not in a hurry.
Tom won't know what to do.
Tom seemed a little surprised.
We didn't find him.
You're just afraid you're gonna have to kiss Tom.
He came back two days ago.
The work is not shameful.
If you bite me, I'll bite you, too.
You really should've let me call a cab.
I baked apple pie.
The top of the horse's hooves calmed him down.
Your hands are soft.
Can I see him again?
That's not my real name.
This book covers the subject in its entirety.
I think this is over.
Linda was wearing modest dresses all the time.
You didn't smoke?
They let me go.
Tom never thanks anyone.
He overthrew his classmates.
These are my parents.
I'm late for school.
Tom's been in touch with Mary.
Are you cooking for yourself?
Tom told me he'd like to go to the zoo with us tomorrow.
I'm sure.
We're gonna need to get Tom's permission.
His jokes made us all laugh.
The main question is what to do about it.
I'm sure you've seen everything you need.
This is pointless.
They ate.
How many cups of coffee per day are too many?
Tom hates to run.
Excuse me, do you know what time it is?
I clapped my hands.
Tom doesn't have a brain.
I'm just a farmer.
You would have done the same thing in my place.
Now, let's continue the conversation in the other room.
I don't hate myself.
Tom wouldn't do that.
Don't talk to me like that!
I smiled at you.
Can I see the report?
That's not very wise.
Are you gonna go?
I'm so happy these days.
I didn't make that mistake again.
Let's stop playing tricks.
Try to understand this.
What kind of man were you?
I should try to help them.
Can I collect a soul?
She's helping him.
Always try to see the best in people.
Tom earns three times as much as I do.
I cried one.
Write down your date of birth.
I'm sure Tom didn't know about it.
I'll call him later.
These are just as good as they are.
She looked excited.
We're wasting time.
Tom said he and Mary won't be able to come to our party.
Just try to find him.
Tom hung his coat in the closet.
I think Tom's tiny.
Is the difference visible?
Visit us tomorrow.
Tom visits Mary once a year.
Nothing seems real to me.
Did you ask Tom for money?
Tom didn’t actually do that.
Is this your bag?
It will help her sleep the most.
This is Nina, your granddaughter.
I'm going to top the pots.
They've been chanting for half an hour.
Dolkun has been working very intensively lately, but he doesn’t see the slightest result from it.
Dan found out that Linda was looking for the police.
I'm making dinner.
Please come to my house next Saturday if you want.
I'm not convinced.
That's not really necessary anymore.
Can you shut up?
Tom didn't know where Mary was wandering.
The house is red.
We've seen aliens.
I have to go to the hospital tomorrow.
Where's your sister?
Tom's sleeping tight.
It was seven and a half.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston with Mary.
I want you to be with me.
She wanted to become a nurse.
Tom has an obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Don't talk about him like that.
Love is stronger than hate. <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
You have a rash.
It's written on his face.
Thank you for coming.
I'm as tall as he is.
Tom couldn't have done it without Mary's help.
So there's Tom?
She spent the night drinking in a meatloaf.
I'm in.
Do you need a date?
Saul's gone.
I didn't say I trusted him.
It's a classic.
Tom's already there.
I'd like to repay you.
They're coming again.
You're really cute.
I bet Tom paid a lot for his new car.
This is a joke.
You wouldn't believe Mary at all.
I've never seen a rainbow.
I don't think they followed.
I feel like I'm free.
Just keep smiling, okay?
You didn't notice the change.
I think you're gonna have to help them.
Tom helped Mary escape from prison.
Tom doesn't have tea.
I'm tired, I'm going to bed.
But that's not an argument!
Tom got a drink.
What can I say to the children?
Leave him, Tom.
I've overcome the shock.
It's a good system.
I don't remember Tom being so tall.
It was really nice.
I'm free tonight.
Tom knew Mary was upset.
Tom started shooting.
How did you spend your vacation?
At that time, we were just a few people among a group of gorillas.
She began to put her fingers in her hair.
I'll tell my wife.
What if I don't invite Tom to my party?
Tom handed Mary a cup of coffee.
Do you travel a lot?

The water glows in the sun.
A is a set consisting of members B, B, and A.

Are you sure you were alone in the house?
What did you need?
You're a con man.
It's common knowledge that you're not dear Tom.
I'd be happier if the three of you came back out.
What's stopping you?
Tom has thin lips.
The kids are blowing bubbles.
Tom exercises the violin for at least half an hour every day.
I'm still mad at Tom.
I'm using this.
This is Tom's book.
You don't think it's worth it, do you?
It's a lot of fun.
Let's do that tonight.
I felt their pain and I suffered with them.
I wish Tom had more time for me.
I'm longing for him.
Tom had a bad day.
My grandmother's death was a shock.
You burn the car.
She learned to drive a car.
Tom had a few more things to say.
Let's not panic.
I don't have the willpower when it comes to exercise.
Let's go to Tom.
This is one of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen.
Tom's room has a noise.
At your service.
I want to watch football on TV.
Still, I'd like to go to Boston with you.
What did Tom say?
Do we really need that much food?
This is one of the most popular restaurants in Boston.
Tom seemed to be a little uncomfortable.
I invited Tom to my house.
Tom and Mary seem to be perfect for each other.
I couldn't ask him for money.
The more things I have, the more I have to clean.
I found a solution!
I haven't seen Tom.
Don't forget to soak in the sun cream.
Was it hard on you?
Tom’s voice was barely heard.
Don't be a jerk.
I decided to forgive him.
How many days does it usually take to get there?
Don't forget these.
When will that happen?
We're gonna have to reschedule.
His depression ended when she kissed him.
We're not even sure if Tom's guilty of anything.
Is she pregnant or just fat?
Just get some sleep.
Tom's good to me.
No one will find us.
The room was a mess.
Music is love in search of words.
Sitting all day is unhealthy.
Tom will be waiting.
I'm watching you bend over.
The real story is a little different than what you said.
It was your mistake.
The balloon was slowly coming down.
Who wants insects?
It's bullshit.
I asked him the same question.
Take three steps and jump.
I think we should wait a little longer.
I'll be back in half an hour.
Tom never behaved like he was ashamed of me.
My real name is Tom.
Tom began to laugh.
Is that why you're here?
You haven't changed your mind, have you?
When the phone rang in the middle of the night, she knew something was wrong.
We're avoiding him.
I want to give you something rare.
I'm totally naked.
Her gestures don't matter to me.
This is for you, Tom.
It doesn’t matter that you don’t want to do it; you do anyway.
I did it.
Are you ten years old?
We still need a plan.
Aren't you glad to see me?
Marisol and Johnny are having pizza.
It's not a big miracle.
We need something that takes our thoughts away from our problems.
I called him yesterday.
Let me focus. Let me focus.
She sells schools of the sea.
Guard the prisoner.
We all like you.
The child cried and cried for hours.
I'll go ask them.
Tom doesn't look like his brother at all.
Tom was a stranger.
That was brilliant.
Please, tell me.
You're not a freak.
Aren't you thrilled?
Tom couldn’t do it alone.
You're a wise man.
No one went there.
Let me introduce Mr. Tanaka to you.
Do you know how late it is?
Tom cut the question into eight pieces.
Maybe you'll be needed.
I have chest pain.
I can't untie the knot.
Give me my money back.

I can't do it alone.
You'd better let me do that.
This house is better than the other one.
I'm sure Tom did that.
Let me see it.
What does it contain?
Did you see anything?
I'm done.
Marry me.
Tom is not a hero.
I'll find someone else to help us.
The sun and the night shine.
No one will get fired.
There's no one else.
When I was traveling to New York from Boston, I met a nice girl on a bus.
Tom said you were in Boston.

Do we really want to help them?
He who pays the bills has the right to rule.
You're very lucky.
Yeah, get me some porridge.
When will you visit us?
Tragedies happen every day.

What can we do?
I'm guessing you found it.
Don't take it too literally.
Tom's pretty talkative.
I'll help you find her.
Tom didn't call Mary.
I think Tom's crazy.

This is gonna work for now.
They need to talk.
That's not how it happened.
It's not that you weren't right.
Tom listened at once.
I thought Tom wouldn't want any help.

I don't want to stay here a minute longer than I have to.
Tom introduced himself to the people behind the counter.
You have to buy them a gift.
I'm not happy with Tom's explanation.
Looks like you're right.
He ran away so they wouldn't catch him.
You know, you don't mean anything to me anymore, Mary!
Tom is not back yet.
It has a sentimental value.
I asked her to play with me.

I'll call a few people.
Now what do you see?
We're screwed.

Do you like English?
This is exactly what happened to a good friend of mine.
I got these cuffs from my grandmother.
I don't have a drinking problem.

Your mother put your collage in the top drawer.
You've had a traffic accident, but you'll be fine.

I want to take you to a place where I know you'll be safe.
How long have you lived there?
I don't know why you don't like it.
No, I didn't mean that!
Tom wanted me to stay.
I can't believe I bought this.
He saved the sailor.
Tom was obviously here earlier on the left.
Get up already, you lazy one!
How long ago was that?

I want to fuck her.
I can come tomorrow.
When did it happen?
I've fallen in love with you.

I saw Tom and Mary.
I let Tom catch me.
Tom's already here.
They look busy today.
I'm sure Tom's never been to Boston.

Is there a problem?

What can you expect?
I want you to come to Boston.
This is a gun.
I want to live in Brazil.
Make an appointment.
I'm in love with Tom's girlfriend.
Take care of Tom.

Tom was irresistible.
I agree with the plan.
Justice is expressed through action.

Pray for her.
Will you wait a second?
It's not over yet.
Look at the banner on the square.
Didn't anyone tell you that you don't have to be here today?
I was very pleased.
I can feel it in your touch.
He fell from the tree.
Tom told Maria that he had never met John.
Did you get all that?
You better go help him.
Tell me if you get a boyfriend.
It was amazing.
Why does everyone hate him?
I can barely see him.
I'm coming.
I was in the middle.
Don’t expect everyone to have the same opinion.
I appreciate the good stuff and the books.
This is so much worse.
I'm afraid Tom's going to get lost.
I thought you were crazy about Tom.
Something's bothering me.
Don't you ever suspect anything?
I stared at the man.
Take care of Tom.
They look familiar.
We have work to do for them.
All my dreams will come true.

Looks like we're having a snowy Christmas this year.
You met my sister, right?
I hope we find her.
Tom's new in town and he needs a job.
I was surprised when Tom said he was unhappy here.
Tom works in a closed room.

This is really easy.
Are you going on foot?
You should try it.
You're too busy worrying.

Tom seems worried.
I take care of him.
Tom's excellent.
I suspect Tom broke the window.
Tom's getting close.
Tom is shocked.
Are you leaving Boston?
Tom's sympathetic.
Let it be brief, Tom.
Tom called to ask if there was anything he could do to help.
We could've made it.
This isn't anyone's fault.
I don't like the taste of onions.
You can't sit there.
I want to know why you're late.
Tom ran to the vet.
Let's go to lunch.
It's warmer today than yesterday.
It must have come from somewhere.
The cottage was fully equipped, with a swimming pool, barbecue, football field and billiard table.
Tom says he wants to learn French.
We're all pawns.
I'll see you again.
We were so young then.
I hear you've been wondering about me.
While he was eating pizza, he was annoying his sister.
We should have given up sooner.
That's close enough.
Tom's polite.
Don't count on them.
I'm surprised myself.
We're having dinner.
My previous work has been lost.
"Why are you doing this?" "I can do it."
What a pig you are.
Lock the gate.
Tom lets the heating go.
We're all the same.
I want to be next to you.
I think we're close to a solution.
You're not that terrible.
Well, I'm here for you.
You may come, but don't tell anyone else.
This was my mistake.
This sounds totally acceptable.
How do you know that?
They were polar opposites: one was honest and trustworthy and the other unpredictable and irresponsible.
Can't you help me?
I'm not going to kneel.
What were you doing with Tom yesterday?
I'm not going to sneeze.
She turned off the computer.
She bought it at the butcher's.
We need to know exactly what we're doing.
Why would I trust them?
I'm from Beijing.
There are only two kinds of Irish.
One by one, the boys came to see what I was reading.
Who do you live with?
So, what do I tell him?
Where's your kid?
Tom's in bed and talking on the phone.
These are wonderful.
Tom's hands are busy.
Tom was thrilled.
I eat pasta.
Can you translate it?
We're lucky.
You probably think I'm a pervert.
Where did Tom work?
I'm proud to pass them on.
The noise disturbed the whole town.
Anyone who loves flowers can't be a bad person.
This isn't bullshit.
They're closing in.
You're mean.
Did you pass the note to Tom?
Do you know anything about us?
Honey, I can explain.
Let's go bowling.
Was it an explosion?
You have small breasts.
I think Tom needs a ride to the airport.
Are you writing messages to Mary?
Is there a doctor here who knows English?
Tom was whining.
Is that Tom's coat?
This table has a smooth surface.
She always wears an attack outfit.
Tom was the boss.
That's ugly.
There may be discussions about it.
Women don't like you.
It's time to get up.
This isn't your problem. It's mine.
Before I went to bed, I took three cold pills.
Tom might not be right.
They may need help.
I don't have vodka.
Tom's acting like a spoiled brat.
It's a shame you screwed up.
We should ask him.
I'll get them back.
What did you want to see me for?
I think I figured out what time we should leave.
They're very good.
Do you like movies?
Time is eternal.
First of all, you have no right to draw conclusions, and secondly, your argument was based on an invalid assumption.
Who would blame him?
The audience seems to be bored.
I grow goods.
He borrowed the line.
I'll see you later.
I had to get something.
I trusted them.
My mother had to lend me her keys.
Tom has mustaches.
There was a war going on.
And Tom was involved?
The thief turned into a policeman.
We'll let Tom try.
That would be logical.
I'll wash my hands.
Pick one.
Tom's angry and scared.
You're mean and repulsive.
I wish I could help you more.
Tom can't be seen anymore.
I think we're done.
Tom saw Mary sitting alone in the park.
Why was Tom in Boston last week?
They were completely renovating the building's fa<0xC3><0xA7>ade, and when I drove past it, I didn't recognize her.
Is it possible that this is all there is?
We'll deal with this later.
If this happens again, let me know.
I'm your new partner.
This has to stop.
It's fair.
I know you're busy.
All the children were sitting in a circle on the floor.
Tom forgot.
Invite him to join us.
It won’t be easy to do this without a lot of help.
Tom knows Boston well.
This time we won.
Tom works in a restaurant nearby.
I don't want to tell my boyfriend.
Who helped him?
They gave him a sedative.
This has nothing to do with the topic.
I'll be back in a little while.
She seemed to be deeply moved by the question.
Tom told Mary to be quiet.
If we are not careful, the same thing will happen to us.
Here I am.
Tom was my boyfriend.
We need a little help.
I thought Tom was from Boston.
This is a very difficult exam.
I'm getting a divorce.
That dinner.
My jar's leaking.
You'll get wrinkles.
Tom is a good poet.
The bridge collapsed when one of the ropes broke.
The geyser ejects a jet of hot water every two hours.
Listen to your teachers.
You're not suggesting we give all the money to Tom, are you?
Tom continued to pack.
I don't have a home I can go back to.
I'm here of my own free will.
It's to protect you.
Someone has always helped me.
They don't want that.
Tom's taking over.
I'll tell you all about it later.
My dogs are white.
That's comforting.
He's very shy, he says he wants to see you.
Tom was right.
What color are they?
It could be dangerous.
I need to talk to you.
Did you get anything from them?
Can you get in touch with him?
Tom said if he won the lottery, he'd buy a new house.
Maybe I'll write a book.
I don't like math.
Defend yourself!
First of all, be kind to older people.
Precious stones include aquamarine, amethyst, emerald, quartz and ruby.
Go find them.
You need to get permission from your mother first.
I'll take Tom's place.
What did you think of coming to Boston?
You are our guests.
Tom insulted Mary.
I know I packed it.
You've got a lot of chickens.
It was a wonderful day.
I made him take a picture of me.
Who drew it?
I've been waiting for them for a while.
I was eating fast.
Tom remembered a variety of things that no one else remembered.
You can easily distinguish them.
I'm gonna go look for her.
Of all the languages I've learned, French was the easiest for me.
Tom wrote the homework.
I counted to 200.
Take care of this.
Shall I go?
He looks like a monkey.
The ashtrays are beautiful.
Have you ever had sex in a public park?
Wouldn't that be a shame?
How much did you do?
Stay away from Tom.
What else did you want?
We've got fried goose with potatoes.
Do you think Tom bought that?
Did you borrow money?
Can't you stay here with us?
Boston is beautiful.
This project is not going well.
Why don't you eat meat?
Express your idea specifically.
Can I stand up?
They were all so busy.
I lied to you both.
I'll lose everything.
I need food.
Tom pointed to Mary.
We don't drink enough water.
I have a home.
He was breathing deeply.
That's ugly.
I'm not good enough for her.
This woman is easily embarrassed.
Can you get there by car?
I think I might be able to help her.
I'll do as I please.
Tom's got a lot of time.
I'll be fine.
I've lost something strange.
When was the last time Tom came to visit?
Tom has always been poor.
That's a lovely alka.
Go see if Tom's in the office.
You're the prisoner.
Tom slapped Mary in the face.
Were you home alone?
He extorted a large sum of money from her.
Can you help me solve that?
I can't lie to Tom.
Her only wish was to return to see her only daughter for the last time.
She's the woman I want.
You were in love with Tom, weren't you?
Do I look fat in this?
Can you do it alone?
I'm gonna go find someone else.
I'm hungry.
I bought a dog.
Is there anything else I can do for you?
Spiders make spiders.
You really talk a lot.
It may be too late.
I couldn't find them anywhere.
It's a special occasion.
You don’t always have to believe what the other person says.
He's in love from head to toe.
Don't buy me anything.
Tom's oldest daughter is not married.
Knowledge is the ultimate goal.
Tom's funny.
In my opinion, Tom is innocent.
Tom's a pain lock.
Who's driving?
Tom won't be able to help you.
Let's just get to work.
You're upset!
I think that’s the only possible conclusion.
People sometimes ask me what I’m going to do when I’m retired.
Tom recognized Mary's handwriting.
I think you've helped enough.
It must have been her.
Where are we going to eat?
Tom knows how to do everything.
The sound soon died down.
Who froze you?
I don't quite understand myself.
Tom's a good dancer.
I'll come as soon as I can.
It's a police vehicle.
He knows the secret.
Tom was in bed.
He knows how to plant palm trees.
How do you know about him?
Just keep going.
Tom's a good friend of yours, isn't he?
Say you understand me.
Tom was so tired that he fell asleep without eating dinner.
How's Tom gonna get in?
There's someone on the doorstep.
Tom wasn't leaving.
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger.
Let's try to call her.
It was a great day.
It was a lovely evening.
I think it's possible to sneeze.
You're welcome.
Peter may need a new diaper.
How's Tom doing at work?
I don't want him to know where I live.
Tom doesn't talk to me about anything anymore.
I can't just give up.
Tom wants to swim.
I'll scream.
I'm not your bitch.
What's our status?
Do you want me to keep it?
You're such a hater.
Boston is a wonderful place.
Who is responsible?
I'm serious.
I think it's better not to drink water.
No one's talking.
What did you think of contacting them?
Nothing can be done.
You got anything?
It's not cold at all.
Will you do the same?
There were witnesses.
I don't know why it's so hard to believe.
I don’t want to be treated differently than before.
You should be all right.
I followed the rules.
Tom's a widower.
I think Tom's soulless.
I haven’t seen that movie yet.
You've already done that.
You're poor.
Give me another nail.
Many Russians were killed while taking pictures of themselves with their phones.
He thinks the old newspapers are still useful.
I want to be invited.
We see who laughs, but not who weeps.
How old are you, Tom?
He was wearing a red scarf around his neck.
The girl said nothing.
It was getting dark.
There's one thing I don't understand.
He's having fun listening to music.
Try the shirt.
I'll tell Tom you're here.
Tom didn't accept Mary's invitation.
I can barely work now.
When did Tom say he was going to start his party?
This was obviously a difficult decision for Tom.
Maybe Tom would have been happy with Mary.
Dan did his job very well.
My feet are still hurting.
I would do anything to help him.
Hey, wait a minute.
I may have fainted.
It's hard to assess his ability.
That's good.
I know a man sitting there on the other side.
I just had a vision.
You can't treat me like this.
I am open to everything.
I used to watch you.
Stop where you are.
Are you a cheater?
"She likes music, doesn't she?" "Yes, she does."
The barber's done it.
That's very interesting.
We still want to help.
I'm gonna get lost.
Her sister gave her a flu shot.
Did you try to talk to Tom?
That sounds pretty stupid.
Tom didn't stay here long.
Tom liked the idea.
Tom started chasing Mary around the playground.
I don't have a name.
Why don't I ever win?
Tom fell off a ladder while he was cleaning up his lumps.
Do you have anything to add, Tom?
Shut up, you fool!
Sometimes I can't help myself.
Damascus is located in Syria.
All the songs were good except for yours.
I don't think Tom's gonna be in school tomorrow.
Please, this way.
We'll wait patiently.

Next year, my birthday will fall on Sunday.
Everybody was laughing.
Did Tom look happy?
Who wrote the messages?
Tom's making pancakes.
Tom took a deep breath.
Tom has two choices.
Have you ever been to a cave?
Dan didn't want to go to the orphanage again.
We can start tonight.
He's a liar.
Tom's waiting outside.
It's nice to feel like you need someone.
You'll never know.
I'm still thinking about him.
I thought it was causing me.
Tom looks lonely.
Shall we try again?
No one came.
How much money does Tom owe you?
Are you a vegetarian?
I can't find my pen.
Tom won't know how to use it if you don't show him.
You bought something for Mary.
There's nothing more like a madman than a drunk.
Take Tom.
Tom began to undress.
I know Tom's been through this.
Looks nice.
We stopped in Boston.
This almost works.
I can't concentrate on all this gala.
Share the cards, Tom.
The robbers tied his mouth.
You made fun of him.
This medicine will relieve the pain.
I'd like to honor you for dinner.
Can't he wait for that?
They're gonna pay for their uniforms.
Dan didn't miss an episode of that soap opera.
I love butterflies.
Nothing will change my love for you.
I asked them to sign the papers.
We have a few questions to ask you, Tom.
I thought Tom had a good time.
I hate her as much as you do.
We can get you some help.
I heard him.
We're investigating the whole area.
Don't forget that Tom still loves you.
Tom told me he'd like me to come to see him tomorrow afternoon.
I'm gonna miss everyone.
This is where we'll be.
Why do they do that?
I went to college for four years, and I got nothing but a poor diploma.
This is priceless.
You want to draw?
It was pretty disgusting.
Tom's listening.
I don't plan on staying here that long.
We're back together.
After the fire, there was only ashes left.
Tom likes all kinds of vegetables except cabbage.
Try to put yourself in his skin.
Tom used to write poems.
We'll take Tom home.
Tom needs to know about this.
I'm ready to make up for it.
People can't do miracles.
That's a little rough.
They decided to cut him off from their society.
Those who mix the verb endings "-<0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x82><0xD0><0xB0>" and "-<0xD1><0x81><0xD1><0x82>" are waiting for a special place in hell.
What happened next?
You know what's going on?
Can you deliver that?
Why do I have to go?
They seem to be everywhere.
I didn't count on it.
I was being rude.
I just saw Tom last week.
This shouldn't take us long.
I'm trying not to freak out.
Tom's got to clean up.
We're very angry.
Tom's not that old.
Everyone knows how to drive.
Tom welds two pipes.
He was in the hospital for a week.
I didn't give her anything.
Tom made a good first impression.
Please, sit inside.
That's not my signature.
I decided to contribute exclusively with Spanish sentences for a whole month.
That was terrible.
We're glad you're here.
You earned something.
It's really ugly.
Would you like some cheese?
They say blue eggplants contain a lot of nicotine.
Looks like I'm feeling a little tired.
She gave him all her silver.
Do you speak French?
Tom doesn't want any surprises.
My wife is chaste and devout.
I'll pass it on to Tom.
I don't think I'll be able to pass the test.
I think we'll join in.
Tom leaned forward.
Tom's got a good car.
You're interesting.
This time I can win.
All people on earth are descended from a common ancestor.
Sometimes I'm right and sometimes I'm not.
I'm having fun.
We all have to go find Tom.
I'm all set.
Do you need help with this?
Tom, your patent is open.
We have a warrant to arrest you.
Tom's not going to the market.
I came to bring him a present.
I asked her to describe it.
I just took a shower.
I didn't do it alone.
What's that?
Can people really be so foolish to think that the entire population of Georgia, who speak Caucasian language that has neither common phonemes nor common letters with English, can completely master English in just two years?
I'm just guessing.
Tom doesn't like milk.
Our attempts were in vain.
There are too many things I don't know.
He had respiratory problems.
Tom's good at tennis.
Berlin is very cold.
I'm the madman.

Do you miss Boston?
I think you should call him.

Tom's not my type.
These are for them.
Do you really have to work weekends?
What's your bag?
I asked them to stop.
Here's my album.
I swear it wasn't me.
I have a great idea.
I got something for him.
How do I know if Tom is right for me?
Tom is studying agriculture.
I hit Tom.
Didn't you fix the pump?
Isn't that sound wonderful?
This is not Tom’s first time.
How can you be sure?
We have to give them something.
It's not up to you.
The students are gone.
You've done so much.
Kate is very charming.
Where'd you go?
Your path is hard.
You're gonna have to sit still.
Tom picked up his flute and started playing.
Tom wants to be rich.
That's perfect.
You have no idea how to do that, do you?
Get him out of the way.
Blood flows through the blood vessels.
You borrow books.
I can barely move.
Tom wondered how good a singer Mary was.
Look at my fingers.
You took my place.
Tom's bad.
My interest in politics is purely academic.
I'm not a musician, but I sing in the shower.
You're lying to me.
They're playing volleyball.
When did you buy it from them?
Let's eat.
I wanted to go home.
What didn't help us?
I really want to learn French.
We all have to die.
You hate us, don't you?
Dan learned his lesson the hard way.
He showed them the falsification of my friends.
I give my workers the right to leave early.
Are you alone here?
It's happening right now, isn't it?
The cat's on the roof.
What's in that closet?
Tom's too emotional.
I'm too low.
I'm sorry.
What books do you need?
Tom asked me if I liked Boston or not.
I don't like big dogs.
I'm full.
He was eating a cabbage salad.
I'm going to run.
Tom something chewy.
I want to buy you a present.
It's stuck.
Tom had never been to Boston.
It's nice to be independent.
Tom is very popular.
I have a big family.
Now no one can help me.
I'm glad you're back.
I'll get some ice.
Come and take a look.
Do you think you're likeable?
Innocence is usually a blessing, not a virtue.
Tom's heart rate's increased.
There's a restaurant nearby, but it's not very good.
That mistake is very common.
I know about the job.
When are you busy?
She persistently scolded her boyfriend for being kind, compassionate, brave, and I still don’t know what.
Did you lie to me?
Tom wants to protect me.
Can you show me those pictures?
Let's go eat.
Why do you love me?
Tom trusts Mary.
You were busy.
I didn't know who else to ask.
They're doing it now.
Thanks to the victory, he became a hero.
Tom said he wasn't interested.
Tom's watching TV.
I don't know why it always has to be me.
They stopped going.
That's not a mistake.
I saw the sponge in the sink.
I was born in the 1980s.
Tom loves his life.
The shape of the skull is different in different people.
I'm not comfortable with heteronormative propaganda.
Go home to your wife, Tom.
I can't hold on much longer.
Deserve a reward in itself.
It all makes sense.
I'll open the door for you.
I saw an unidentified flying object.
I asked you how you were.
I don't know how to behave here.
We need to advertise on TV.
Tom nodded inaudibly.
They're not gonna help you.
I'm feeling great.
They're not there.
There's nothing wrong with me.
They have a good appetite this morning.
The rat made a hole in the wall.
Tom hated me.
How did you know I wanted to be alone?
You have to be happy for them.
This candle is very heavy.
Tom stopped crying.
All these things are waiting for me.
Is it really a diamond?
You know I don't eat meat.
It seems very sleepy.
Yesterday I made a cake with mushrooms.
I hope he succeeds.
Why don't you leave me alone?
Tom won't be home for lunch.
Is there a prize?
Believe in science!
Although the maggot has both a male and female reproductive system, it needs another individual to fertilize.
The failure shamed Lisa.
I heard Tom got sick.
Tom fainted.
Don't smoke in here.
Does Tom have a key?
I'm on my way right now.
Tom had no choice.
Poverty teaches you to eat bread without butter.
The temperature of the sun's surface is believed to be about 6,000 degrees Celsius.
There's no need for that.
Do you know where to find them?
The crowd went crazy.
Tom started to work.
Tom wanted Mary to buy him a birthday present for John.
Cover him.
The police are looking for them.
How deep is the hole?
The bread is fresh from the oven.
Tom won't believe it.
I'm gonna get Tom to examine it.
That was a shame.
I need Tom's address.
It's kind of sad.
I just didn't trust her.
Maybe Tom's gone.
It's been three weeks since Tom moved to Boston.
Tom's very smart.
Where did you want to eat Tom?
I got Tom's keys.
Tom turned it down.
I left Boston three weeks ago.
It's exactly ten o'clock.
I told you my father died when I was thirteen.
Have you ever written a letter to Tom?
I need three markers.
Do you need it now?
Do you know much about us?
Somebody killed Tom.
Tom wasn't thrilled.
That was awfully bad.
This must be yours.
We arrived just in time.
I kind of felt sorry for you.
Cigarettes are sweet for adults.
Tom and Mary left handprints in the liquid cement.
Cavaler would never do such a thing.
I love them.
Have you tried hypnotherapy?
I'm sorry I wasted your time.
That was inconceivable.
This is wonderful.
Tom, don't make fun of me on Tosho.
Call the number I gave you.
I'll check on you later.
Is there food?
I'll cooperate.
I bought him something.
I'd say no.
No one deserves to die.
Then I didn't know what that meant.
Tom has never lost hope.
I need to spend more time at work.
In what situations would you do that?
I'd like to buy a room.
Tom never told anyone where he hid the gold coins.
Fortunately, the hole is stable, otherwise the storm would have knocked it down last night.
I heard she got caught.
Tom's got it all written down somewhere.
There's no good news.
Who are you working for these days?
I'm quitting.
Mary’s eyes lit up with joy.
It's bad to pee.
I only have one minute.
Tom never gives up.
I think Tom's a conservative.
How much do you guys want?
I'd love a piece of pie.
I'm sick of your constant complaints.
Don't you care what happens to Tom?
I used to dream of becoming a ballerina.
I'm sure I'm right.
She's getting mysterious.
Give me that envelope.
I don't care what you say, Tom.
It happened too soon.
You scared her.
Tom cheated on us.
What was I saying?
Tom bought a coat.
How did Tom get hurt?
Tom doesn't want to come with us.
Tom will only tell you what he thinks you want to hear.
Let's not panic.
I wonder who's buried in your grave.
The salesman cheated on him.
It's all in the room.
It's Tom's office.
People are more important than money.
I paid the penalty.
I want to know who that phone call was from.
Were you home at ten?
It's closed today.
Please let Tom know.
I'll make her help you.
I called the police.
I can't give Ken the right to go abroad.
I was thinking about you.
Where could Tom be?
Tom's on his way to Boston.
I have dinner plans with Tom.
She made me tea.
It's a simple matter.
I hear there's a lot of competition.
Tom saw Mary on the other side of the room and approached her to address her.
I don't need a cardiogram.
Would you like to go to dinner with me tonight?
Tom was reading a book.
I'm looking forward to seeing the new version of Tatoeba.
It seems pointless.
I don't know anything about the future.
We're both from Boston.
Why don't you sing?
Did Tom really do that?
I didn’t know how to play basketball.
Don't you ever feel like you don't know what you're doing?
It was a great honor to have been asked to give a speech.
Tom's not into sports.
I'm confused, Tom.
I don't see anything.
Open up your horses.
Did you read what I wrote?
Tom felt very lonely.
I really want to try new things.
Tom wasn't the only survivor of the massacre.
Let's talk about you.
Tom doesn't laugh.
I started seeing him.
We'll hurry.
Haven't you eaten yet?
Tom found me a cab.
He did miracles.
The glands produce chemical substances in the body.
That wasn't my idea.
Tom's resting.
Don't run around.
It's best if you don't talk so much.
This is a new model.
I was giving him help.
The music unites.
This is just a simulation.
Nice to see you, Tom.
Somehow I felt sorry for her.
He's overly generous.
Tom was sleeping outside.
She hurt her leg when she fell off a bike.
Why do rabbits have big ears?
Get over here!
You could have refused.
Why don't you let me help you?
It'll happen soon.
Hey, it's suffocating in here, so get me out before I choke.
It will happen what will happen.
I've heard that story.
It's still dark outside.
That's what Tom wanted to say.
Is Tom there?
I'll find her.
The police found nothing to link Dan to the robbery.
Do you feel guilty?
Many philosophers were from Greece.
Romeo is the one who loves Juliet.
We have to help her.
Just listen to Tom.
Tom was being polite.
Looks like I'm gonna have to wait a little longer.
You can go and stay however you want.
This is your wine.
I just gave it to them.
This is the best ink.
Let go of my hair.
Can you speak louder?
Where will the meeting be?
Let’s play “Truth or Dare.”
Its conclusions are based on unproven assumptions.
There were a lot of girls at the party.
Tom began to read the book.
That's the real reason.
Tom likes flowers a lot.
Tom told Mary to be more careful.
I fainted.
I'm calling him right now.
Tom's not very nice.
Do you know who I am?
Why don't you listen?
His presence is important to me.
I knew we'd find him.
The sound of your voice is like a siren's song to me.
I don't want you to put yourself in danger.
I'm fat.
How much time do you spend in front of the computer?
My wife is getting sick of her daily routine.
I want to know how you did it.
Amoebas are single-celled organisms.
Tom said someone here needed help.
How long have you been in Boston?
Tom rolled my arm.
You're crazy!
How late is the train?
Let's park over there.
That's very stupid.
Yesterday was hot, but today is more bearable.
I'm cold.
He walked in front of me.
Give me that back.
Is he breathing?
Tom left Boston last night.
This is not fair to me.
Maybe someone was watching them.
Maybe Tom's going to Boston next Monday.
It's so boring.
The kid kept all his money in a cash register.
I wish I'd met her.
They smiled.
I'd like to hear from him.
This is a leather belt.
Tom agrees with me.
Turn off the light.
Do you want me to come to you?
I'm going to Boston next week.
Would you like some more bread?
This isn't gonna work.
He's just gone.
The kids were so excited after the party that they couldn’t sleep.
That sounds urgent.
I feel very guilty.
I read his book.
They said they were thirsty.
This is hard for him.
He hit me.
Do you think we'll get to the station in time?
Everything seemed fine.
The mother was cruel to her adoptive father.
An international language would be of great benefit to mankind.
I've been giving them help.
Have you already made up your mind?
Dan asked Linda to sleep with him.
Tom didn't lie to me at all.
It is unique and irreplaceable.
You can't leave a baby alone.
Tom has mental problems.
Tom began to eat.
She's good-natured.
What time is it?
Have a nice weekend.
Do you want soda water?
Tom winked at the girls.
We've been very demanding.
Tom is different now.
Drop them off the deck.
Japan as a country has many different characteristics.
It's disturbing.
It was an offer I couldn’t refuse.
The monks used to play tennis in the monasteries.
Don't be so perverted!
Tom wants proof.
We didn't come here after them.
It didn't matter.
Here's your salary.
I'm sorry, I called the wrong number.
Put that gun down.
Tom has small hands.
I'm worried.
I hate them.
I don't speak German.
The exam covered mathematics, physics and chemistry.
Tom's a money-launderer.
Have you ever kissed?
I'm trying to avoid them.
Didn't you say you could swim?
Don't put any pressure on Tom.
They betrayed me.
And he's taking out the paper.
Tom doesn't know how to express himself.
Attend the meeting.
I'll get a picture of how you made the speech.
This sentence has five words.
He ate lamb cremes, potatoes and mushroom soup for dinner.
We've been waiting outside.
He's not as handsome as Tom.
It's easier this way.
Tom lied to you.
I wouldn't go that way.
I wonder what Tom is doing right now.
It's hers.
That's not really an option.
How old were you when your parents divorced?
French is hard.
I rarely ask questions.
You're a prisoner.
Tom thinks I'm right.
The doctor examines the patient.
I'm sure I can find them.
The smoke rises in the air.
The printer isn't working.
I'll send you to the door.
It's dark in here.
Tom's a troublemaker.
This was too much for her.
Tom wondered what would happen if he pressed the blue button.
If you see Tom, could you give him this?
We can order pizza.
Tom's doing a lot better.
I just want to talk to Tom.
The prince agreed.
We're drinking water.
Maybe we should stop.
Mary represented her team in the match.
Tom doesn't want a party.
It looks like an egg.
I just want to visit Tom.
I'm a loner.
We don't want any more accidents.
There's no way it was Tom.
I'll kill you.
Most people have great resistance to getting up early, even when they have to.
Give me the gloves.
I looked at Tom.
Who's there with you?
What are you so excited about?
Nothing's good enough for Tom.
Tom's gone mad.
It wasn't very good.
Mechanics should be understood in oils and lubricators for engines.
How was yesterday?
You have to study hard.
We can't fire them anyway.
They have families.
I'm married to Laurie.
Let's have breakfast.
I'm salting my omelet.
Tom explained the rules to Mary in detail.
Did you buy him a dog?
They got you, didn't they?
I completely forgot about him.
An interesting question remained unanswered.
Tom thought Mary would enjoy the concert.
I pulled out my knife.
They were dancing.
Tom pulled the rope.
We're not free.
I'm going to bed at ten and a half.
I don't know where it went.
There's a boy running up to me.
Tom now looks very tired.
I'll follow your instructions.
I put it together.
Tom remained calm.
You said you'd help.
Cells are the basic constituent units of living things.
They're amusing her.
I should go change my clothes.
How long have you been working as a doctor here?
Tom wrote that book.
Chukunbaba died one day after the birth of my older sister.
He hesitated for a few seconds.
I've always wanted to live in a place like this.
Tom sat down to work.
Tom chose the wine.
Tom doesn't have much of an appetite.
I'm claustrophobic.
Tom didn't tell me he couldn't swim.
Tom quickly got lost in the crowd.
As far as you know, I don't care at all.
No, I'm still a bum.
This is hard for me.
How do you feel about her now?
I'm not surprised.
That surprised me.
This is what we discussed the other day.
I think Tom can help.
Life is a deadly sexually transmitted disease.
That doesn't surprise me.
Turn to the corner.
She betrayed me.
Why do you blink when we kiss?
Someone will see us.
I'll give him another chance.
Tom finally laughed.
Tom's house is here somewhere.
I left you a message.
Would you like that for Tom?
I misjudged her.
A little while longer and it'll be over.
I didn't say I agreed.
Did you know my father?
Tom was about to shoot me.
Tom'rchi.
I had to arrest her.
They know something.
He knows how to play the piano.
Give her some privacy.
Tom didn't even offer Mary a cup of coffee.
Don't talk like that.
I think we can catch him.
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
God created the seven.
It's not too early.
Can I eat?
They painted the frames of the yellow windows.
Tom, are you in here?
You can use this car.
I'm glad about that.
It's like I messed up.
We have to wait here.
Is everything all right with you?
Does that sound familiar to you?
How much do you want?
Tom's losing blood.
I have to stay here.
All or nothing.
This information is confidential.
I came for them.
My life has changed.
Nobody's talking about them.
Did Mike stop drinking alcoholic beverages? No.
You and I will be on the same plane.
Tom's not coming back.
Tom promised me a lot of money.
Who gave him all that money?
I thought we could help you.
Tom's not listening.
I'll get the wine.
I'll remember that.
What time does the hour start?
Can you move your ears?
I met Tom at an auction a few years ago.
Did you win the race?
One hour before the event.
You guys were amazing.
I won't give up until I find out who was responsible.
The alarm's ringing.
The bird raised the branch with its beak and flew to its nest.
Tom wanted to leave.
I know about the job offer.
It's already open.
It depends on whether we buy it or not.
Tom's not the same man he was three years ago.
They all smiled at her.
Tom asked Mary to let him take care of it himself.
There's something I need to ask you.
Tom's pretty good.
I have to go see Tom.
Tom is unusually calm.
I'll ask Tom to set aside time for you tomorrow, Saturday.
What the hell did you buy?
Tom was trying to get rid of it.
What am I gonna do to them?
Tom didn't say anything to Mary.
It's not the right time.
I'll be home before noon.
I think it's time to start getting ready.
I went and bought ten sheep at once.
It took a lot longer than I thought it would take.
Tom ran by Mary's side.
I was scratched by a cat.
Tom's not an old man.
The question is how did Tom do it?
I swear it was them.
Did you have a bathing suit?
His nose is the best feature.
I can't ask them now.
Tom has wavy hair.
Long live the USSR!
It's fierce.
I want to buy pineapples.
I was home yesterday.
That's my only hope.
Don't come after me.
The simple question is DE.
The bush is burning.
Tom was affected.
I was bitten by a conscience.
How did you know Tom was gonna lie to me?
Each country has its own language.
Tom wants Mary to make spaghetti for dinner.
Frogs are wonderful creatures.
He has three brothers.
I don't know if I'll have time to do that.
Tom's drunk on tequila.
In other words, she's a little deaf.
We humiliated Tom.
You're messing around.
We want more money.
Don't get lost.
Do you get along with yours?
There's something wrong with Tom.
You should have asked her first.
Tom has a scar on his face.
Don't you believe us?
I pay you my respects.
Be merciful.
Let's follow the others.
Before I go to sleep, I listen to music.
I'll pray for them.
Those benches are mine.
Was it a good trip?
You have to work together.
Show me your hand.
They're hunting dogs.
You should make a habit of brushing your teeth after every meal.
Now let's get out of here.
Tom gathered his hearts.
I know Tom's secret.
Tom stayed out.
This is the king's most trusted advisor.
Did you buy this for her?
Go change your clothes.
Tom was really angry.
I'll cook for you.
I think we should hire him.
Where'd you get that from?
Tom's a great doctor.
Tom's very unhappy.
Where did you get these?
What else do I get?
People are trying to eat here.
I need you more than you can imagine.
No one will be hurt.
Tom gave Mary a wristwatch.
I'm sure Tom added Mary's name to the list.
Tom didn't notice Mary wasn't at the party.
He changed jobs.
It's too late to help you.
We were trying to hide it.
When was the last time you saw that cat?
Tom continued to climb.
Tom might be able to set your car on fire.
Did you hear that?
What did they find?
He was lying to my eyes.
I'm gonna go find her.
I wanted to take a shower.
They're listening.
I didn’t know Tom did that.
If I ignore him, he'll leave.
They'd just get in Tom's way.
Maybe I should help her.
Don't touch the exhibits.
Maybe I can find her.
I learned it by heart.
I have nothing to give you.
They found an isolated beach and spent the day there.
Nothing's changed.
They were all on strike.
He's a little deaf, so speak up.
I borrowed money from him.
Tom's heading south.
Love is like oxygen.
It's up to you.
That's a very dry-paired explanation.
The walks before breakfast are refreshing.
Because the note was written in French, it was easy for me to read it.
We'll make it work.
It is too risky to fight them in a place of their choice.
Wasn't that terrible?
Tom tried to kill himself yesterday.
I despise his rude attitude.
I asked Tom to help you.
We're not safe here.
They set him up for murder.
There's no answer from him.
We all want to see the movie.
It's very simple.
I'm coming for her.
Tom was wearing the T-shirt in one piece.
When was the last time you cleaned your room?
Let's not fight, shall we?
The dinner was great!
Control yourself.
Multiplication is commutative, and division is not.
I'm kidding.
Tom took off his hat and bowed.
We're running out of oil.
I don't think Tom's gonna go.
Whose handwriting is this?
Did you see what it says in today's newspapers?
What did we do wrong?
Tom drinks three to six coffees a day.
Tom shrugged loudly.
It was Beter.
Tom started talking.
I'll ask you to stay for a while.
We hear two goats.
I see Tom every day.
Everyone pointed to her.
Maybe Tom's gonna die by dawn.
We don't have a dog.
Hurry up and you'll get there in time.
Tom was insane.
The can is empty.
There's grapes in the fridge.
Why did you ask me?
Why did you pretend to hear about Tom for the first time?
Tom let go of his hand.
Einstein thought of himself as a philosopher.
My pair of glasses blurred.
So it wasn't no.
I didn't mean to say that.
Tom wasn't with me.
That's a fact.
We all cheered for her.
Didn't you see the aluminum flag?
Settle down!
I told you it would be hard to get out.
I think I found one.
You're gonna try, aren't you?
Tom's been without food all week.
I don't understand you.
Even though I'm a godly man, I'm still a man.
Tom apologized for being late.
Are there any problems I need to know about?
Tom has to work.
I can't find her either.
Don't be so angry.
A lot of people are hunting.
He deserves the award.
Can we have a word?
Where are we headed?
Tom basically does what Mary does.
There's something we need to investigate.
Tom opened his eyes.
They can't get out.
That's actually a good argument.
Tom just didn't have much time.
Tom was on the phone.
How are you doing?
Tom was drinking in silence.
I'm hit!
Who said anything?
Tom began to say something, but Mary stopped him.
We met at the meena.
How was Tom?
I wanted to hurt Tom.
You can't fire her.
I had nothing to drink.
I turned the whole town around looking for Dom.
Let him go.
Night life is better in New York.
Please come in.
The drug must be drunk on an empty stomach.
Tom's not a member.
Looks like it's our job not to let that happen.
Why is the universe black?
It's my fault.
I can't afford to pay anyone.
Tom said the house was cursed.
You baked a loaf of bread.
Marzipan pigs don't dig.
Tom is aware.
Tom infuriated Mary.
What do whales eat?
I hope we find him.
Tom likes that.
Tom might be here today.
There is no difference between reality and fantasy.
Tom is a hero.
Tom has no willpower.
Will you help me?
Don't be oblivious to me.
Tom wasn't home when I came back.
I still don't get it.
I've heard that from a lot of people.
I came for him.
Come on, now.
It is better to die on your feet than to live on your knees.
They're digging a hole.
Tom is sad.
I was home all night.
We left there at 11 o'clock.
You can ask me what you want.
He used to love Boston.
We don't have that kind of money.
I'm glad I found you.
What kind of relatives are you?
You deserve a higher salary.
He found someone to talk to.
Well, you were right.
We can't afford this.
My soul is not human, because it is of another dimension.
I'm bored.
What time is it?
I found the room empty.
I've already written my part of the report.
I don’t think they have a cure for it yet.
Each member must be present.
She didn't understand the joke.
This is the ugliest snow I've ever seen.
He hopes to go abroad.
Tom's obviously frustrated and depressed.
You must have jumped.
Who would want Tom to die?
Do you understand his name?
It doesn't seem to help.
You have to let me get a message to Tom.
Where's my golf gear bag?
Read these instructions.
We're not criminals.
The flour is made from wheat.
Don't touch me.
Where can I park?
Tom disagreed with Mary on the subject.
You're fair.
I'll go.
Today is my sixteenth birthday.
I'm married to Laurie.
Let's go back to Boston.
You seem familiar.
I'll eat it.
Well, then I'll go to Tom's.
Did Tom buy any presents?
You two are very sweet together.
You're so pretty.
Tom and Mary were having fun together.
It's very possible I'm wrong.
What is happiness?
Dan hurt Linda's dog.
You scratched your collarbone while you were playing.
I think Tom's funny.
I didn't know there was a pool here.
I was there with Tom.
The show's over.
You can use this pen.
Tom's blind.
Do you really believe this guy's a magician?
Tom moved to Boston in 2003.
Tom was in a hurry.
This is not an easy decision.
His prophecy was fulfilled.
I can't believe Tom's dead.
And then something wonderful happened.
Tom adheres to a strict vegan diet.
I wash my car once a week.
Please let them know.
I need to call her.
He asked me if I had anything to cook.
Keep an eye on the road.
We'll stop on the way.
I heard Tom like a hill.
This tastes like tea.
I wouldn't be nervous about it.
This is your victory.
Does Tom look angry?
Didn't you know how to play the piano?
It's closing time.
Leave it to me.
The stone rolled down the hill.
She went to the hairdresser.
Tom's crazy as hell.
Let's go again!
It doesn't cost him his heart.
No need to comment.
The chicken is raw.
Tom didn't want to sit next to Mary.
Tom's not that young.
At that time, Tom was swimming.
Penguin's very sweet.
You're such a smurf.
We are sorry, but we do not accept credit cards.
It was all right here.
They look smothered.
I could make your job easier.
Put the phone down.
He'd never get out of the house by the parrot.
I think Tom's a chipmunk.
He suffered from a terrible infection of the ovary and flowed.
I don't need advice.
This doesn't cost us.
It doesn't matter.
Tom turned to the exit.
Who would want to kill me?
Sometimes he behaves strangely.
We'd hang them.
This is probably not the right time for this.
I'll be back in a minute.
I have a list of her.
That was very stupid.
How'd it go, Tom?
I have other things I should do.
Believe in justice!
What does Tom say?
Why don't we take it all?
Who took the money?
I'm not incapacitated.
Tom bought two tickets and a bag of popcorn.
You're influential.
I got a message from him.
Bring the kids home for dinner.
Why don't we bake a cappuccino cake?
I need a secretary.
This girl is the smartest.
I had to protect Tom.
This is really relaxing.
Call him right now.
Stick to the topic.
She really likes to talk.
I have a question for Tony.
This is an interesting, funny and even shocking story.
I'll call Tom later.
Every language looks at the world differently.
Didn't I warn you about Tom?
Put on your pajamas.
Navaca.
This is the Holy Land.
Tom loved bananas.
I don't think Tom's gonna want to come have a drink with us.
Let's just not talk anymore.
My birthday is in July.
We've got everything.
How much is a beer?
Tom said he doesn't know how to play tennis.
Where did you find her, live?
This was at the top of the pile.
I'm done with that.
We can't give up.
We were under attack.
He's a godless man.
Tom hasn't spoken to me since we broke up.
Tom just wanted Mary to be happy.
I thought you found someone else.
I don't know if I should sit or run.
Don't you think it's hot enough for December?
I think Tom's dying.
I'm wet.
Are you getting into it?
We just found them.
I bit my tongue.
I'm ringing it.
I lost my sense of time.
This island is an American territory.
Put them anywhere.
Do you want to meet him?
I baked him a cake.
Tom didn't tell me why he didn't like Mary.
How many people are in the room?
I've already thought about it.
I would do anything for her.
Someone must have planted them.
Do you walk to school every day?
Tom's definitely not happy.
I haven't called her yet.
Where's my husband?
You pulled your ankle.
Are you still there?
You're predictable.
I was a little distracted.
