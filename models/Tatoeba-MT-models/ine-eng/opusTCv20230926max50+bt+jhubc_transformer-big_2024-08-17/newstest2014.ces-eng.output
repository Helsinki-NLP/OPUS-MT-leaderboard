A black box in your car?
While American road designers are struggling to find the money to repair a crumbling highway network, many are starting to see a solution in a small black box that will easily fit into the dashboard of your car.
The devices that track every kilometre that the driver drives, and which transmit this information to the authorities, are at the heart of Washington’s controversial efforts and state planning authorities to renovate the outdated system of financing America’s major roads.
Usually, the lackluster design of highways suddenly sparked intense debate and the emergence of various associations.
Libertarians met with groups of environmentalists and lobbyed for the government to use these small lockers that would record the miles taken and maybe even where you’re going – and then use that information to build a tax bill.
The tea party is horrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also deeply concerned and has mentioned a number of privacy concerns.
And while Congress can’t agree whether to continue, some states aren’t expecting anything.
They find out how they can move over the next decade to a system where the driver pays for the kilometer of the road he’s on.
Thousands of motorists have already taken black boxes, some of which have GPS tracking, for testing.
This is a real necessity for our nation.
“It’s not a matter of when we can pick the power,” said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California State Administration Association, which plans to begin tracking every California motorist’s mileage for the state in 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
These technologies are used for this.
The idea is that the U.S.-funded Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by the taxes that Americans pay on gas stations, is at the bottom.
Americans don’t buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars drive a lot more miles per gallon.
The federal tax itself, 18.4 cents per gallon, has not risen in the past 20 years.
Due to the current high price of gasoline, politicians are reluctant to raise taxes by just one cent.
"The gasoline tax just isn't sustainable," said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently placed the tracking device in 500 cars to test this payment system for a mile.
"In the long run, it seems like the most logical alternative," he said.
Experts call it a user fee according to the number of kilometers traveled.
It’s no surprise that urban liberals like this idea, because taxes can be used to change drivers’ patterns of behavior, which can help, for example, curb traffic congestion and create greenhouse gases.
California designers look at this system when planning strategies to meet the goals set out in ambitious global warming laws.
But Republican Bill Shuster (representative of Pennsylvania), chairman of the Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most functional long-term alternative.
The Reason Foundation’s free market representatives are also inclined to think that drivers will pay for the miles they’ve driven.
"It's not a tax that disappears in a black hole," said Adrian Moore, vice president of strategy at Reason.
People pay for what they get.
The initiative is also supported by two former U.S. transport ministers who in 2011 urged Congress to move towards paying per kilometer.
Last year, the U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project to include about 10,000 cars.
However, the House of Representatives rejected the proposal and did so because of the concerns of rural legislators representing the constituents of the population, whose daily life often means to offend many kilometers for work outside the city.
However, several states and cities are moving forward on their own.
The most ardent is Oregon, which included 5,000 drivers in the country’s largest experiment.
These drivers will soon start paying the state a tax for the miles they’ve driven instead of the gasoline tax.
Nevada has already completed the pilot project.
New York is looking into the project.
Illinois is trying to do this to a limited extent with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 state transport ministries, along with coastal states in the east (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is studying how they can implement this change.
However, this concept does not only have supporters.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer cars were recently equipped with the device, drivers were concerned that the government was able to monitor their every move.
“The Big Brother surveillance and similar issues were a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads the strategy and operations management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
It wasn't something that people wanted.
As the trial project continued, the American Civil Liberties Union in Nevada warned on its website: “It would be very easy to turn these devices into full-fledged surveillance devices.”
There is no need to build a huge, cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably expand to record the daily departures and arrivals of individuals.
Nevada is among the few states that are trying to find affordable technology that would allow the state to track how many miles a car will find, but not exactly when and where.
If you can do that, Khan said, the public will be calmer.
The pursuit of such technology led some state agencies to a small company in California called True Mileage.
This company was not originally involved in the action to help the government in the taxation of drivers.
She wanted to break into the emerging market with statutory liability insurance, where drivers would pay based on how much they drive.
But this device, which is being tested, attracts the attention of road network designers because it does not use GPS and delivers only a limited amount of information that is regularly recorded using modem.
“People will be more willing to go if you don’t keep track of their speed and location,” says Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
In some of these pilot programs, a number of major errors have emerged.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do it.
In Oregon, designers experiment with giving drivers a choice.
They can choose devices with GPS or without GPS.
Or they don’t have to take any equipment and instead decide to pay a flat fee based on the average number of miles taken by all residents of the state.
In other places, they hope that the cautious public will adopt this concept if the device can do more, not less.
In New York City, traffic officials are trying to develop a tax facility that would be equipped to additionally pay parking fees for parking hours, provide insurance for miles traveled, and collect data on the speed of other drivers so that motorists can avoid traffic jams.
“Motorists will be willing to get involved because of the value of the benefits that are being offered to them,” the city’s projection document states.
However, some traffic designers would like to know if all the discussion about paying per kilometer is not just a huge proxy problem.
Officials from the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Committee say Congress could very easily solve the problem with the bankrupt Road Trust Fund by raising the gasoline tax.
A one-off or annual tax could be imposed on drivers of hybrid or other vehicles that do not use a lot of fuel, so they will pay a fair share.
"No radical surgery is necessary if you have enough aspirin," Randy Rentschler, director of the legislative and public affairs committee, said in a statement.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers will be worried about their privacy and a lot of other things.
Sobotka negotiates for <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
Social-democracy is collapsing, the people and the grandparents are talking to each other and are preparing a common course.
If the Social Democrats get confused within a few weeks, they will sit down at the negotiating table with perfectly played partners who will put on the table a ready list of demands, including ministerial posts.
The <0xC4><0x8C>SSD envoys will then either swallow sour coalition grapes or nod to a voracious minority government.
Bohuslav Sobotka met for the first time after four days, when he was carrying on a wave of sympathy.
Yesterday, he failed to control the political grémium and, above all, to force the convicted liars to resign.
The only confirmed negotiator for the party so far is he, the other members of the team will be allowed only after the key meeting of the Central Executive Committee (CEC).
I apologized to the members of the church and now to the citizens.
You should not lie, in your personal life or in public.
'It was a mistake, 'said Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, the head of the Social Democracy.
He added that he did not run for first vice president.
"I will announce my decision on November 10 at the <0xC3><0x9A>VV," said Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Similarly, the vice-president of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k <0xC5><0xA0>kromach and the head of the parliamentary club Jeron<0xC3><0xBD> Tejc spoke.
He said he was elected just two days ago.
The two MPs said they would do everything possible to ensure that the 50-member <0xC4><0x8C>SSD club could be heard with one voice.
Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek said of the absurd theatre: "I have been a member of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD for fifteen years, I have always been loyal to its brand and I have respected the decisions of the party authorities."
Or another lie in a live broadcast.
Or did he forget, in calling for Sobotka’s resignation and his removal from the negotiating team, that the August <0xC3><0x9A>VV had decided with 57 percent that Bohuslav Sobotka was the party’s candidate for prime minister?
The head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, however, made a powerful army of enemies by calling the <0xC3><0x9A>VV until next Sunday.
His opponents have ten days to flood the emails of 192 members of this body and the media with various gossip and rumors, possibly recalling the real mistakes of Sobotka's political career.
There will be a powerful washing of dirty clothes, there will be signs of dark alliances between the coal baron Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala and Sobotk's wing.
A friendly relationship between Bohuslav Sobotka and the influential lawyer Radek Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD> will be discussed.
Disputes will arise in the South Moravian or Moravian-Silesian organization <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The words of the mayor of Ostrava and Sobotka's ally Peter Kajnar are warning: "I signed the Charter 77 so that the country is not ruled by idiots."
If the <0xC3><0x9A>VV had met this weekend, the liars would probably have been forced to ritually sacrifice their functions.
The traitors will sprinkle their heads with ashes and stay.
And the currently winning head of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will end up with the nickname Bohuslav Pyrrha.
Martin Doktor on problems with OH in Sochi: Communication with the Russians is challenging
The corners of his mouth indicate a slight smile, and then he just takes a deep breath: "It's demanding."
Cooperation with the organizing team of the Sochi 2014 Olympics is a little more complex, according to Martin Doktor.
We can forget what happened at the last Olympics.
"Nothing works the same," says the head of the Czech Olympic Mission.
What exactly is going on?
A lot of things work more slowly and not so accurately.
It's so confusing.
In terms of invoices, they are relatively fast, not so much in terms of providing information on essential things.
For perhaps three months now, we have been waiting for them to tell us how the individual villages will be officially designated, so that we can do a number of things accordingly.
We're still waiting, and they're still saying they're communicating.
They still communicate in many ways.
Is the Olympic Village at least as far as it goes?
But it's not a disaster anymore.
A month ago, we were walking through empty rooms.
Fortunately, the houses are still standing.
What does it mean to be empty?
Are the floors ready?
Just basic concrete, so that was the situation a month ago.
But they still have time.
Even though there is a danger that we will arrive there on January 26 as a preview, there will still be a feeling of glue.
And if they don't hurry, then what?
Do you think President Putin is going to push the army?
That's probably how it's gonna turn out.
Just so it's not that Olympic Village = Potemkin's Village.
Rather, they are at risk of not being able, for example, to adjust the paths, not to complete the details.
Maybe they'll have the roads in such a state that we'll have to take the London games girls with us.
But I think they're gonna kind of screw it up.
How many Czech athletes could go to Sochi?
Now there are about 78 of them, although depending on the nomination criteria, the number changes.
Maybe the skaters will go in the three that they went out with.
There is no doubt about the speedboat Martina S<0xC3><0xA1>bl<0xC3><0xAD>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, but otherwise it is in development.
Still waiting for you on your way to Sochi?
No, if nothing happens, I should fly there until January 26th.
We know what the houses in the Olympic Village will look like.
We even measured some things by the meter ourselves, so that we didn’t just believe the blueprints.
We also prepare a number of other things, including transportation.
And what does the head of the mission do a hundred days before the Olympic Games?
I prepare for the annual evaluation of individual Olympic sports plus I make a common agenda in terms of communication with the organizing committee in Sochi.
Putin has promised an ecological Olympics, the plan is hating him huge secret dumps
Winter sports fans are already cutting a metre before the start of the Olympic Games in Sochi, others are looking to their preparation with increasing concerns.
The Russian Olympic Games, even if it starts in February, are facing another scandal.
The Russians do not seem to be able to fulfill the promise that preparations and games will not disturb nature in the Krasnodar region at the foot of the Caucasus, where thousands of athletes and tens of thousands of visitors will head in four months.
After the Vancouver Olympics, the Russians had a very high bar, and the Canadian Games were listed as the most environmentally friendly in the history of the Olympics.
However, it seems that the commitment of Russian President Vladimir Putin to organize games with "zero waste" has long been taken for granted.
AP reporters last week discovered a huge dump of building material in the village of Ach<0xC5><0xA1>tyr near Sochi.
So, a landfill full of building materials, tires, canisters and insulation foams was found in August by environmentalists, which they immediately reported.
The Russian authorities were angry and the dump was gone.
But only for a moment.
Last week, reporters were given a look at a landfill the size of three football fields.
It is not the only one, several have been created in the field of such places, described the British newspaper The Times.
The Russian Railways, a state monopoly that builds a roughly 60-kilometer road between Sochi airport and the sports resort, are working on the site.
The company, which has already raised 280 billion rubles, was headed by one of Putin’s close associates, Vladimir Yakunin.
In August, the railways defended that the landfill was founded by one of the sub-contractors.
The local people are already desperate.
According to the population of Ach<0xC5><0xA1>tyr, trucks full of waste material have been driving around for three months now.
According to experts, the waste threatens to contaminate the local river Mzymta, other streams and eventually the Black Sea.
“Water from here contaminates Sochi’s water sources for the next ten to fifteen years,” said Vladimir Kimayev of the environmental nonprofit EWNC.
Illegal landfills are not the only problem facing the Russian Organizing Committee and the government.
The most expensive Olympics in history, according to the opposition, are one large tunnel.
For comparison, the Sochi Games will cost $51 billion, while the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing will cost $43 billion.
Last year's London Games cost just $19 billion and the Vancouver nine billion mentioned.
In addition to corruption scandals, project delays and concerns about whether there will be enough snow in the end, there have also been reports that human rights are not being respected when working at an exhibition of sports grounds and infrastructure.
Last month, one of the workers sneezed to protest that he had not been paid for two months.
Many are also concerned about how Russian organizers are grappling with a new law banning the promotion of homosexuality during games.
Some visitors are going to support Russian gays at the Olympics.
A young couple has matured to live with their parents, a new house offers privacy for both generations
Japanese studio Tai and Associates was tasked with designing a house on a plot that lies on the corner of two streets, with the land itself somewhat sloping.
The request further stated that there would be two generations living in the house who would like to live together, but at the same time each should have its own clearly separated space.
The younger couple also needed a small office.
The house stands on the corner of two streets and on a slightly sloping plot.
The architects therefore decided to place each house in one of the floors of the house.
"In creating the proposal, we respected family ties, history and memories associated with the place."
"The three different functions of the house are connected by several paths through the exterior of the building, so that everyone is aware of the presence of others, but at the same time they have their own privacy," explain the designers.
The home of the parents is on the level of a garden with an old pine tree, to which family traditions and memories are attached.
The individual parts of the house are easily recognizable from the outside, because they differ in the different final decoration of the facades.
While the main segment of the building is made of concrete, the surface of which was formed using panels from planks, the part where the office is, is plastered white and the remaining elements remained in a clean concrete design without further modifications.
Many walls of the house are completely glazed, thanks to which the interior of the house is very associated with the exterior.
The home of the parents, more precisely the kitchen, dining room and living room, surrounds a small garden with a tree, which has great importance for the family.
The connection between the interior and the exterior underlines the side wall, which begins in the garden and continues to the living room.
Kitchen space in the home of a young couple.
A young couple enters the house through the main entrance to the hall and then climbs the stairs to their rooms.
The stairs are the main dominant interior of the house.
Their construction allows a lot of natural light to fall through them cascadingly.
It was through this that the architects tried to distinguish the house from others and to impress something unique.
The home of a young couple is treated as one open space with a kitchen, dining room and living room together.
From the terrace it is divided only by a glazed wall with sliding doors.
Living area with dining and kitchen area in the home of a young couple.
The second floor is composed as one large open space, which freely passes to the terrace, from where there is a nice view of the Tokyo Bay.
The office itself on the top floor is conceived in a pure combination of white and black color.
The staircase is the dominant element of the interior of the house.
A young couple enters the house through the main entrance, finds themselves in the entrance hall and then climbs the stairs up.
Defend academic freedom, it applies to Zeman and the ODS.
In recent months, I have repeatedly called for open letters from students, educators and the management of secondary and university schools in several regions to defend academic freedom from the election campaign carried out by President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman at the schools.
I’ve had more or less success.
The Rector of Masaryk University in Brno, who rejected the lecture of the Honorary Chairman of the SPOZ - Zemanovci in the pre-election period, even received a reprieve in the form of a non-invitation to the celebration of the state holiday of the Czech Republic.
Here is a list of representatives of schools that were no longer so brave and allowed the visit of Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman: University of Technology in Brno, Hladnov Gymnasium in Ostrava, University of Business in Ostrava, Business Academy in Kol<0xC3><0xAD>n, J.E. Purkyn<0xC3><0xAD> University in <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> nad Labem.
Now in Pardubice, we are faced with the continuation of the promotion of politics at universities.
A newly elected member of the ODS, the Dean of the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Informatics of the University of Pardubice, Simeon Karamazov, refuses to step down from his academic position and, moreover, it seems normal to him.
Professor, it's really not the same as if you were to remain, for example, mayor of a small town.
Do you want to join the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD hetmans, who simultaneously perform the functions of MP and hetman and, like them, degrade both professions?
This is because you are telling people that they can handle both of these challenging functions in the left rear.
I know, we have the example of Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek, who can handle even a few dozen functions at once.
This is not an example of a person you should follow.
We will also find the opposite and positive example of MUDr. <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Fra<0xC5><0x88>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, who prefers to leave the parliamentary post so that she can fully devote herself to the leadership of the city of Pardubice.
The main reason for my recommendation to leave the post of dean, however, is that you violate the apolitical nature of the academic soil of the University of Pardubice.
The management of the Pardubice ODS sees your current activities in both positions as an advantage for the University.
However, you will be able to help your "school" without being a dean.
I think that your students will have a similar opinion as I and Rector Miroslav Ludwig.
So, consider your resignation and keep your face.
Otherwise, it may happen to you that the voters will count on you in the next election.
And it doesn't have to last long.
In Kunovice bubble cabbage, chemistry is not added to it
More than a thousand tons of pickled cabbage want to be produced in the next months in Slovak Fruit Kunovice, which belongs to the food group Hamé.
The season here started in October and will last about half a year.
Since 1925, he has been making healthy food in a traditional way, by walking directly in large tanks.
In the modern industrial age, it is a rarity.
Our employees will find a nearly ten-kilometer route in exchange.
Each of the ten tanks can hold fifteen to thirty tons of cabbage, filling one takes three shifts," said Slov<0xC3><0xA1>ck<0xC3><0xA1> Fruta plant director David Kladroba.
Heads of cabbage are transported directly from their fields to the premises of the company by farmers mainly from Ostro<0xC5><0xBE>sk and B<0xC5><0x99>eclavsk.
The employees of Fruity then clean the vegetables, remove the ribs and throw them into the bowl.
From here, the already cut cabbage falls into the pools of six meters deep, in which the tramps work tirelessly, dressed in white clothes and prawns.
This causes the unwanted air to leak out.
The last layer of ground cabbage is covered with a sheet and loaded with water.
"The green round will then ripen for six to eight weeks for spontaneous milk fermentation without any addition of acidification-promoting substances," said Kladroba.
The natural process corresponds to the production in domestic conditions, individual layers of workers pour salt and cumin.
After fermentation, the cabbage travels to the filling line.
It is packed in a sweet-soured infusion into bags or glasses and subjected to sterilization.
Hamé supplies sour cabbage mainly to the domestic and Slovak market.
It is also of interest in some other countries, such as the UK, Ireland and Canada.
Snowden is willing to “cooperate” with Germany in connection with U.S. surveillance
Edward Snowden, a whistleblower with the U.S. intelligence services, said he was willing to go to Berlin to present evidence to the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander were unable to provide answers to questions about their activities.
German MEP Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xA4>bele met Mr Snowden in Russia on Thursday, where he was granted asylum, and discussed the possibility of testifying in Germany.
A letter from Mr Snowden, delivered by the MP to the media in Berlin on Friday, states: "Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive, my government continues to treat the opposition as a failure and is trying to criminalize political manifestations with heavy prosecutions that do not allow for space."
But speaking the truth is not a crime.
In this letter, Mr. Snowden said he believed the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop charges of crimes against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Germany’s interior minister, told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to talk to German officials, we will find a way to make it happen.”
Tensions between the U.S. and Germany began to mount when allegations surfaced that the NSA was listening to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone.
Thomas Oppermann, a member of parliament who heads a parliamentary panel overseeing the intelligence, said that if there were any opportunity to hear Mr Snowden as a witness “without putting himself in danger and completely destroying relations with the United States,” it should do so.
Mr Str<0xC3><0xA4>bele, a Member of Parliament for the German Green Party, posted a photo of him and Mr Snowden on his Twitter post.
On his way to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Str<0xC3><0xA4>bele said that according to a former NSA contract lawyer, Mr Snowden would not be able to return to Russia if he left once.
If Mr Snowden were to testify in Germany, he would need assurances that he would be “safe there,” a member of parliament said.
Mr Snowden said in his letter that he was facing a harsh and persistent campaign of persecution that forced him to leave home.
But he said the reaction of the whole world to his "act of political expression" gave him courage.
Citizens across the country, as well as senior officials – including those in the United States – have assessed the discovery of an unsubstantiated system of ubiquitous surveillance for the benefit of the public.
The letter includes an offer to cooperate with the German authorities "until the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved."
Killing us sorry, but we are innocent, the Red Khmers defend themselves
Nuon Chea was number two in the Khmer Rouge hierarchy and Khieu Samphan is a former head of state.
Under the Khmer Rouge government, which in 1975-1979 was based on a mixture of Maoism and nationalism, more than three million Cambodians, or at least a quarter of the then population, lost their lives as a result of exhaustion, hunger, disease, torture and executions.
This commander of the notorious S-21 prison was sentenced to life in prison by the International Criminal Tribunal for Cambodia in 2010.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan are accused of genocide and crimes against humanity, including torture, enslavement and murder.
Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan defended themselves by believing that they were acting in the best interest of the nation and had no idea what the true extent of the killing was.
"It's easy to say that I should have known everything, understood everything, and therefore intervened and corrected the situation," Samphan told the court on Thursday.
You really think I wanted this to happen to my people?
The reality is that I had no authority," he added.
Nuon Chea said he had never ordered the Red Khmer cadres "to mistreat or kill people, to deny them food or to commit genocide."
But he admitted "moral responsibility" for the dead.
"I would like to sincerely apologize to the public, to the victims, to their families, to all the Cambodian people," he said.
The 55-year-old Bin Sivla, who lost 11 relatives under the Khmer Rouge regime, told AFP she could not accept Nuon Chea’s apology.
"He lied to us."
"He just wants to be released."
"She won't take care of the other one," she said.
"If he hadn't issued orders, his subordinates wouldn't have been killed," she added, adding that the Khmer Rouge leaders were "worse than monsters."
The "foreign minister" of the Khmer Rouge regime, Ieng Sara, was also to stand before the court, but he died in March this year.
His wife, Ieng Thirith, then Minister of Social Affairs, was found by the court in September 2012 to be incapacitated due to dementia.
The leader of the Khmer Rouge, Pol Pot, died in 1998.
Frontier Airlines is about to pay for its hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge an amount of up to $100 for hand luggage on board at its flight times.
Frontier Airlines plans to introduce a charge of up to $100 for carry-on luggage and $2 for coffee or soda, though in their announcement Wednesday, they said passengers would be able to keep the entire can.
A new hand luggage fee applies to luggage in the upper storage area, so small luggage under the seat will still be free.
Frontier says it will charge $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 if paying passengers wait until they arrive at the gate.
A spokeswoman for Frontier, Kate O'Malley, said the $100 fee was meant to encourage passengers to take care of the payment in advance.
"We don't want to charge that fee," she said.
The airlines began charging for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers tried to avoid these charges and packed as many hand luggage as they could in the storage area as they could, so there was often no space in this space.
Fees are one way to teach passengers to take less stuff on board.
O'Malley said that the purpose of this new fee is not really to get more money.
The point is that Frontier’s most loyal customers have made it quite clear that finding a place in the upper storage space is becoming increasingly difficult.
Passengers who purchase tickets on the company’s website will not pay.
This means that one passenger in the front line at the Frontier gate can bring baggage for which they will pay nothing, while the other passenger in the front line will pay $100 for the same baggage.
O'Malley said the websites and check-in procedures would be adjusted to ensure that passengers were aware of the charge before arriving at the gate.
Frontier’s new carry-on baggage charge will not yet be effective until the summer, but the date has not yet been set.
Travelers often complain about baggage fees and other fees, but airlines love them.
They argue that handling baggage costs money, and passengers who request this service should pay for it.
Many on Wall Street see an additional baggage charge as a sign that airlines are trying to raise enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most of them did not pay for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines was the first to charge for hand luggage three years ago, and another low-cost carrier, Allegiant Air, followed suit later.
The only company that also has such fees is Hungary’s Wizz Air, says aviation advisor Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional fees.
In his December 2011 report, he estimated that Spirit’s carry-on baggage fee would bring in $50 million annually.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently flew with Spirit and wondered what he saw at the gate when passengers encountered Spirit’s unusual toll on hand luggage.
“Getting on an airplane was the smoothest thing I’ve ever seen in my aviation career,” he said.
I was expecting to see a gnashing of teeth and a fight at the gate.
The plane was full, he said, “and the approach was in no time.”
Frontier will also charge a fee for coffee, tea, soda and juice, modelled on Spirit.
Frontier said that passengers who receive lemonade or juice can keep the entire can and coffee will be replenished for free.
Water will continue to be served free of charge.
US Airways briefly attempted to impose beverage charges in 2008, but, following complaints from passengers, withdrew seven months later and was not replicated by any other major airline.
Frontier’s last move to charge for carry-on baggage, if passengers do not purchase a flight directly from this airline, is its latest effort to direct customers directly to its website.
Airlines pay online travel vendors, such as Orbitz, $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This gave all airlines an incentive to lead passengers to purchase directly from them instead of doing so through online travel agencies.
However, Frontier went the furthest in this area.
In September, it began giving customers who bought through an online travel agency only half a mile under a loyalty program.
On Wednesday, she cut the reward for the miles flown to 25 percent of the miles from the trip.
So the 1,000-mile journey with Frontier purchased through an online travel agency means a $250 million reward.
The company also allows customers to choose their seat in advance only if they make a purchase directly through the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in its home city of Denver, but its business is shrinking and losing money.
According to financial results provided on Wednesday by the company's partner Republic Airways Holdings, sales fell by 9 percent and transport capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter.
With the sale of this airline, Republic is trying to solve the financial problems of Frontier.
The NSA does not blame hackers for the fall of the website, but "internal error"
The Secret National Security Agency said last Friday that its website had been down for several hours last week due to an internal glitch, not a hacker attack, as some claimed on the Internet.
"NSA.gov was not available for several hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a regular update," the agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The claim that the outage was caused by a DDoS (distributed denial of service) attack is not true.
Earlier this evening, online server trackers noted that the NSA’s websites were down for at least six hours, and the sites are no longer available to some users.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s internal sensitive networks were not “at all” threatened.
The spokesman said no classified information was at risk.
At least one group of Internet hacker activists claimed to be responsible for shutting down NSA sites via a DDoS attack.
DDoS attacks are designed to flood the target website with information until the servers move and the page crashes.
This cyber tactic is relatively simple and the purpose of the attacks is not to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The former NSA super-secret agency, which once earned the nickname No such agency, has become the focus of public attention in recent months after the string of revelations of foreign and domestic surveillance programs and the target of a bit of criticism overall product of the alienation of secret NSA files by the agents of their agency.
This growing controversy surrounding the agency has fueled earlier speculation that today’s accident was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
Bombardier's profit fell as a result of drop in deliveries and orders
Canadian aircraft and train manufacturer Bombardier on Thursday reported a 15% drop in net profit, which is due to fewer orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual issues in the train unit.
Montreal-based Bombardier also did not disclose any flight test data for its new CSeries aircraft, nor did it offer up-to-date information on whether the aircraft will comply with an ambitious plan to start commercial operations from next September.
After the start of the test flight about a month and a half ago, the plane flew only three times and the question arose whether the test phase is progressing well.
The results did not meet expectations and Toronto stock market shares fell by 8 percent.
State bank analyst Cameron Doerksen on Thursday lowered the rating from "higher profitability" to "sectoral performance" with the expectation that the stock market will experience limited growth over the next quarter or two.
“While we expected smaller aircraft deliveries for the most part, the profit margin in the field of transport disappointed us significantly,” Doerksen said in a report to clients.
As the trial program continues, we believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries aircraft.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect that the market skepticism towards this program will increase.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft will break into the lower market area, which is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was discovered in March, and after several months of delay, the first flight took place in September.
However, the number of binding orders for CSeries aircraft reaches a modest 177, as potential buyers are waiting for the test flight results to verify the company’s claims regarding low consumption and cost savings of this transport aircraft.
Currently, there are a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and operators.
CEO Pierre Beaudoin expected Bombardier to reach its target of 300 binding orders when the first aircraft is put into commercial use.
Senior officials also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the program was proceeding according to plan.
"The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected," Beaudoin said in a conference call, noting that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the flight's downing.
Every manufacturer plans them differently.
We decided to take the first flight and then focus on the updates and we did.
This will happen throughout the flight program.
According to Bombardier, the second of the five test aircraft is expected to take off in the coming weeks and the rest shortly thereafter.
Analysts, however, are skeptical that the first customer could start operating the CSeries 12 months after its first flight.
Bombardier claims that it has evaluated its plan to put the aircraft into service and will provide updated information in the coming months.
“This slow pace of flight testing – despite being in line with Bombardier’s internal plan – is likely to strengthen our view that commissioning will be moved to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
From $172 million or 9 cents per share in the previous year, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million or 8 cents per share in the third quarter ending September 30.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Turnover fell marginally from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
According to Thomson Reuters’ IBES system, analysts expected a return of 10 cents per share and a turnover of 4.56 billion.
The fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it had delivered only 45 aircraft during the quarter compared to 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
Unfulfilled orders in the aviation division amounted to 32.9 billion as of September 30, which does not change as of December 31.
“The results in aviation were consistent with our outlook, but the low order intake and overall market condition disappointed us,” Beaudoin said.
Revenue in the aviation industry fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest train manufacturer, said revenue in the division rose nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
Unfulfilled contracts in transport amounted to 32.6 billion as of September 30, which is marginal growth compared to December 31.
The profit margin in the transport division was affected by problems with the implementation of several large contracts.
The executives said that new prospects will be provided in the fourth quarter.
Shares of Bombardier, which also announced the arrival of Google Chief Financial Officer Patrick Pichette, fell 8.5 percent to $4.83 during trading on Thursday afternoon.
Brazil's Embraer SA, the third-largest manufacturer of commercial aircraft and Bombardier's closest competitor, reported a 10% decline in quarterly profit on Thursday.
A Cocaine Addict Who Warned the Mafia of a Police Investigation Is in Jail
Basharat Ditta, 42, was to hand over information to the king of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough.
The lawyer was worried that his drug addiction would come to light.
The Liverpool Crown Court sentenced him to three years in prison.
A top defense attorney who briefed the drug mafia on a major police investigation because he feared his drug addiction would come to light was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, was supposed to give sensitive information about his drug smuggling activities to the head of the underworld, Neil Scarbrough, after he became a suspect in the use of cocaine.
The lawyer, nicknamed "Bash" (the party) and who was criminally hailed as the best lawyer, was arrested at his home in 2011 following police surveillance of Scarborough, whom he represented in previous drug-related proceedings.
Police officers saw Sarborough, 32, leave three bags of cocaine at a lawyer’s home in Blackburn, Lancashire, who was just having dinner with his colleagues from the Law Society.
Based on tests that found traces of cocaine in his hair, on his wallet and his credit cards, the investigation showed that Ditta was a regular user of Class A drugs.
During an eight-month period, from January to August 2011, he attempted to obtain information about the arrest of two men in favor of Scarborough and his companion.
All four suspects were being monitored at the time as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in the Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire areas.
After police detained about <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine along with <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids, an additional 32 people ended up in jail along with them.
Ditta, 42, passed on information to criminals for fear of coming to terms with his cocaine addiction.
Today, Ditta, who works at Blackburn-based law firm Forbes Solicitors, had a moment of shame before the Liverpool Crown Court when, after a three-week trial, he was found guilty of obstructing justice in two cases.
During the previous hearing, he confessed to possession of cocaine.
The lawyer’s downfall came after Scarborough’s police investigation found that he had been in regular phone contact with Ditt in February 2011.
Two detectives watched the suspect, recorded his arrival at Ditt’s house, and saw him place drugs of 60 percent purity under a lawyer’s basket in a black golf glove.
Scarborough and Ditta, who were having dinner at Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park, were in regular phone calls.
The lawyer returned home to find the drugs, and there were nine conversations between the two people.
The court heard that traces of Class A drugs had been found in his hair, wallet and credit cards, and that Ditta was a "regular user" of cocaine.
Ditta was later arrested, but denied using cocaine, saying he spoke to the suspected dealer because he was his client, arguing that their conversation fell into “confidential communication.”
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards from it, but they were all detained and his hair samples were taken.
During the police interrogation, he said that he operated the office both at his home address and at the workplace, and that his clients visited him at home because of work issues.
However, the court heard that after key arrests, he contacted major players in the drug supply chain, some of whom he had previously represented, to tell them what detectives know about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said: “Anyone else is more aware that they can’t break the law than a criminal defense attorney.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a lawyer and of having come into too close contact with a specific client.
The relationship we are talking about here is not only about a drug dealer, but a drug dealer who supplies his own lawyer with drugs.
Some of his conversations were undoubtedly legitimate because he was his lawyer.
But it went far beyond the usual lawyer-client relationship.
The police investigation dreamed as much as he could to allow them to continue their criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta did not bring good reputation to his profession, on the contrary, he despised it.
He became too close to certain of his clients, especially Scarborough, and allowed his independence to be undermined.
Ditta denied the offence, saying, “If I were a corrupt lawyer who I am not, and I wanted to pass the information to Mr Scarborough, I would not wait 15 hours, but I would do it immediately.”
After the hearing, Lancashire Police Inspector Lee Halstead said: “Mr. Ditta became a criminal himself from a criminal lawyer when he began to obtain drugs from organized criminals.”
His addiction to cocaine made him hopelessly weakened and vulnerable to the intentions of the leading representatives of organized crime groups, who gave him the task of collecting valuable information about the police investigation.
Legal representatives must adhere to the highest principles of integrity and have the public confidence and the feeling that they can rely on them.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the cloak of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit in Lancashire conducted an investigation against Mr Ditt, which also convicted him of three counts of possession of cocaine and now of obstructing the pursuit of justice, demonstrating our commitment to bring criminals to justice.
This case should serve as a warning to all criminals that no one is beyond the reach of the law.
We'll find you and stand before our courts.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being found guilty of conspiring to supply heroin, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other people involved in the trade were jailed for 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta held an online interview about himself, in which he said that his dream job would be to legally represent clients from the death row in America, as a guest at a dinner he would like Mohammed Ali and as a motivation for the work he cited inequality.
He negotiated a government with Klaus and <0xC5><0xA0>pidla.
Now John the Baptist was sent to the Gentiles to be killed with the sword.
The people won fourteen seats in the elections, that is, only a third of the number of Social Democrats or YES representatives.
But they enter into government negotiations with at least one advantage.
In the team, which has already begun to argue the outlines of a possible coalition, they have Jan Kasal - a man who set the conditions for government participation for the people in 1992, 1996, 2002 and 2006.
The Social Democrats and Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> do not have such a matador on their side.
This will probably remind us of the first negotiation in 1992, when the ODS was also a completely new party.
"The experience was minimal at the time," Kasal estimates how this year's talks will develop.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
"This is a frightening report and it is appropriate to ask what will prevent Parliament from simply undermining the independence of the judiciary tomorrow," the newspaper said, calling the bill unconstitutional.
“This law is strict and very repressive and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which includes CapitalFM, one of the most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal "will always be biased because it's an extended hand of government" and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the president will listen to us and we will ask him to reject this bill and return it to the House," he said.
According to the Star newspaper, the bill effectively gives the government “full control over the media” and Standard newspaper says democracy and freedom of speech in Kenya have “taken a hard hit” and criticize the bill as “strict.”
Approval of the bill comes amid a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security immediately after the September attack by an Islamic gunman at a Westgate shopping mall.
Kenyan media turned their anger on themselves when they broadcast a security camera footage of soldiers sent to the scene of the attack allegedly robbing a luxury goods store.
The police director responded by having two journalists and a senior media officer called for questioning, but the subpoena was later withdrawn after pressure from the media.
According to the new draft law, media companies can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million, along with the risk of “listing out” or they can be denied official journalistic accreditation.
The court also has the right to seize the property of the offender if the fine is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, “one fine is enough to wipe out most radio stations.”
It is also stated that these measures can have a liquidation effect on what is called the Kenyan “living blogosphere”.
Politicians know that if they silence the media, they can do what they want with impunity.
"You never know what might happen," wrote Nation newspaper Mutuma Mathia, describing Kenyan media as a key source of a system of mutual control and balance in public life.
“If we leave it to the politicians, they will bankrupt the country and throw us back to hunting and gathering,” he wrote.
Lawmakers in Kenya have been the target of public criticism in the past.
In May, they voted to abolish the cuts ordered by the national wage agency and to restore their fat wages to around 532,000 untaxed shillings per month, which are among the highest in the world.
They must be saved, the young Czechs know.
Most of them don’t even know what the interest rate is.
More and more Czechs are putting their money aside.
However, they do not qualify for the regional championships.
Most of the money is saved by the Austrians, who save an average of 181 euros per month.
A little more than the Czechs save people in Slovakia.
This is according to a survey by the Erste Savings Barometer group in Central and Eastern Europe.
It also showed that the mood of the recruiters is improving, and two-thirds of those surveyed plan to put more money aside.
While the Czechs are roughly in the middle of the ranking, in Romania and Serbia people still use very little of the savings products.
For example, almost every second Serb is saved at home "under the pillow", according to the survey.
This year, the number of those who save higher amounts per month has increased in the country.
Last month, 26% of respondents put a thousand to 2.5 thousand crowns on various types of savings, this year it is five percent more.
However, the average monthly storage in the year-on-year comparison fell slightly to 2078 crowns.
The biggest hit among savings products is retirement insurance.
This is preferred by 54 percent of Czechs, while three years ago it was the most popular way to evaluate savings for only 36 percent of people.
On the contrary, the popularity of building savings is declining, compared to last year, interest in investment funds has also fallen significantly.
They already use only 16 percent of respondents, while last year it was almost a quarter of people.
The survey also found that while people consider it important to save, most of them don’t know what returns they make on individual products.
Especially young people under the age of 30 do not know how their money is encumbered.
On the contrary, the oldest group of respondents has the best awareness of the profitability of their saved money, among people over fifty, 73% of respondents know this.
In an international comparison, the Erste <0xC4><0x8C>e<0xC5><0xA1>i group leads in the use of online banking, which is regularly used by 44 percent of people.
They are followed by Slovaks and Austrians with a 12% gap.
The UN celebrates new goals to fight poverty
The United Nations is urgently working on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) that were introduced 12 years ago to tackle global poverty.
Prior to the UN Sustainable Development Summit, which began overnight in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomats played a key role in advancing the “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which expire in 2015.
They were included in the final concept of the document, which will be approved by world leaders, including Mrs Gillard, during the summit.
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that it was time to "come above the national interest."
“I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to launch and take over the process to implement the overall Sustainable Development Goals – the SDGs,” he said.
The SDGs will build on the progress achieved under the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development agenda.
I will make every effort to fulfil the mandate given to me by the Member States and to implement our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which builds on the success of the MDGs.
Mozambique's Security Concerns Rise Due to Conflict of Strong Personalities
Under the statue of Samora Machela, the founder of Mozambique, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to call for a rare public demonstration using peaceful slogans.
“We want peace back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, CEO of the investment company.
Fearing for her country’s future, she swapped business clothes for a t-shirt decorated with the words “we demand security” in Portuguese and joined a crowd at Independence Square in the capital on Thursday.
After two weeks, there were almost daily reports of conflicts between government forces and the Renamo side, some of the worst clashes since the peace deal more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by the White government in Rhodesia and then by the apartheid government in South Africa as part of an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
After the peace agreement in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts are convinced that it is unlikely that an open conflict will re-emerge in the country, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals.
A rapidly growing economy is at stake, as discoveries of vast offshore oil reserves and coal deposits in the northwest can bring in more than $50 billion in investment over the next few years from companies such as Brazil’s Rio Tinto and Vale, Italy’s Eni and the US’s Anadarko.
The ruling Frelimo party, a dominant political force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the resulting tension.
The Renamo Party claims that the government sparked the latest conflicts by launching an attack on its members on September 17 in the province of Sofala, the traditional stronghold of the Renamo Party.
Violent attacks by former rebels culminated when government forces attacked the Renamo party base and attempted to kill Afons Dhlakam, the group's leader, Renamo Fernando Mazanga, a spokesman for the party told the Financial Times.
The government accuses Renamo of launching conflicts because it said it attacked soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza sought to alleviate fears of instability.
Mr Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Mr Dhlakama saw himself as a "destroyer" who wanted to use "anything left of his power to try to prove that he can order the government's own decisions".
Both Frelimo and Renamo say they want to avoid war.
But concerns grew when Mr Mazanga's words were quoted that Renamo's party was withdrawing from the 1992 peace deal.
He told the FT that he thought Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with seriousness," Mr Mazanga said.
Previous talks between these parties have done little to ease tensions between these parties, fueled by a number of clashes this year.
It’s a tug-of-war between two great personalities (Guebuz and Dhlakama), said Open University lecturer and Mozambique expert Joseph Hanlon.
Neither of them is a good negotiator and neither of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Renamo party, which has been pushing for electoral changes, has already said it would boycott the municipal elections scheduled for November.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an effort by the dying movement to obtain benefits and financial gains from the government.
Renamo's electoral share has been declining since 1992, while the newer party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (DHM), which was founded by a former member of Renamo's party, is expected to improve its position in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga says that Mr. Guebuza – whose second term ends next year – wants to destroy this country’s democracy.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democratic system, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to let go of the presidential office,” Mazanga said.
It's unclear what the Renamo party's options are, but it has carried out devastating terrorist attacks on police stations and vehicles on a key road between north and south.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is several hundred kilometres away from the capital Maputo, but where the city of Beira is a port that mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, rely on for their coal exports.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for about a week, when Renamo threatened to attack the line.
Mr. Mazanga declined to comment on whether Renamo would repeat his threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that the situation in Mozambique is not good,” Mazanga said.
Instability has increased frustration from the government, says Fernando Lima, head of independent media company Mediacoop, and many people are also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent flood of kidnappings.
“People think that the responsibility for the country’s future lies solely with the government and the president and that he should be the one to find solutions to the problems,” he says.
Demonstrator Omar Sultane says people just want stability.
“No one cares about Renamo or Frelimo, people just want peace, they want to have free access to the roads,” he says.
Children should learn myths and legends as “models for a way of life,” says the author.
The stories of Thor may show that “rough power cannot be equated with clever lust,” while Arthurian legends reveal how important it is to have a dream.
A large part of the myths “would be too wild, too scandalous, and in some cases too obscene to teach at school,” said Crossley-Holland, who pleads for a careful selection of works appropriate to his age.
“I think it’s great that myths and folk art are already part of education,” he said.
I've been defending this plan for 20 years.
He added that the “openly instructive” authors and teachers are at the heart of the compelling story with the “under-the- threshold” message for children as a “switch off”.
Crossley-Holland, who translated the epic Beowulf from English and who also writes the Norse myths (Penguin Book) and British national fairy tales, says: “You can have good intentions, but you’ll do better if you keep them to yourself.”
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need for some sense of hope.
Not that everything has to be simplified or end up happy, but there has to be a natural sense of good and evil.
And it must be subconscious; revealed through story, not openly stated.
The old truth is that it is better to show than to describe.
The Brno Observatory will take visitors to the universe in a new digital
At first glance, it is clear that the hall of the great planetarium has changed in the last six months.
There is a new stage, visitors can plunge into the new comfortable seats and above their heads a projection area with a diameter of 17 meters in the shape of a dome from the American company Spitz.
In the middle of the hall is its most important part, the new projector from Japan.
To make the picture perfect, other smaller projectors are scattered around the room.
Another important part of the whole facility is hidden behind the walls of the hall.
"It's about twenty-one computers that generate the image," said director of the Brno Observatory Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Computers will ensure that the image from several projectors does not overlap, but gives a holistic impression.
"The performance of computers is thirty to forty times higher than that of classical personal computers," said Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Hlad<0xC3><0xAD>k, a technician at the observatory.
Digitarium can create an extremely realistic and plastic model of the night sky, the human body or the bottom of the ocean.
The viewers will be able to see right in the middle of the universe or the human brain.
Other similar facilities are closest in Warsaw or Hamburg.
The management of the observatory plans to project the purchased programs and its own creation in the hall.
There are two shows on Saturday.
The first is called the Astronaut and is intended for adults.
In it, people will learn about the training of astronauts, fly into space, turn to the centrifuge, and then on visual examples they will see how challenging conditions astronauts in space face.
The second program is for children and is called Magical Rock - Kaluoka'hina.
It tells the story of a cliff whose colorful inhabitants lived a quiet life until the moment when a nearby volcano erupted.
The entire digitarium cost about fifty million crowns, which was mainly paid by the Ministry of Education.
The city of Brno and the asterisk from its budget also contributed smaller amounts.
The projection area cost ten million crowns, the projector twelve million.
"The rest was swallowed by audio-visual technology and computers," Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek explained.
The digital installation followed the reconstruction of the entire building, which the observatory underwent two years ago.
According to Du<0xC5><0xA1>ko, 25 to 30 thousand visitors could come by the end of the year.
We studied 11 THOUSAND INSERTS!
We know where they want you to work!
In November last year, the analysis captured more than 11,000 job ads, of which 4,300 were published in the daily press and 6,800 (62 percent) on the Internet.
The Internet is thus becoming the most important medium for the publication of job offers.
As early as 2005, when the survey was first conducted, its share was 26 percent.
In the last two surveys (2007, 2010), it stood at about 60 percent.
According to the analysis, the advertising of job opportunities in itself largely reflects the current situation on the labor market.
An example may be a simple comparison of the number of published advertisements in the period of economic prosperity and in the period of economic crisis.
For example, in 2007, almost 25,900 advertisements were published in the same period, less than half of which were in 2012.
The job offer on the Internet is oriented towards a narrower, especially more qualified group of professions.
In contrast, the job offer in the daily press covers a wider range of professions, including those of workers, said the author of the analysis Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>astnov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The level of representation of selected professional groups is different for both media.
On the Internet, the leading positions were attracted by ads looking for managers and managers, business representatives, programmers and financial experts.
The position of programmers or managers of small enterprises was only on the Internet.
In the daily press, the share of these professional professions is significantly lower, on the contrary, large representation belongs mainly to the service and labor professions.
Of course, education is one of the most frequently mentioned requirements that employers express through an ad offer.
Other areas of study included knowledge of foreign languages, especially English.
In the daily press, the requirement for knowledge of a foreign language was stated in three percent of advertisements, on the Internet in 37 percent.
Only in two percent of the ads, employers demanded an active knowledge of two foreign languages.
Claims for ‘computer literacy’ appeared in 40 percent of ads (in the daily press at 11 percent, on the Internet at 57 percent).
Practice in the field was required in 54 percent of advertisements.
The requirements for practice are generally linked to qualified professions.
This is especially the case with production managers and other managers.
Workers’ professions are mainly mechanics and repairers or manufacturers and processors of food products or repairers of electrical appliances, added study author Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Tillner.
Employers also state the requirements on the characteristics and skills of potential candidates in half of their advertisements.
As the most frequently requested skills, communication skills have been appearing in advertising in the first place for a long time.
Furthermore, employers demand flexibility, adaptability and dynamism, independence, responsibility, organisational capacity and reliability.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of New York Comedy Festival: New Yorker
One could argue that New York City is the place where a solo comedy performance was born in America: almost a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fray, who worked as the chairman of the ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes to the assembled people by the method of conversation.
Fay’s innovation has expanded over the years, most recently through the New York Comedy Festival.
The festival, founded and directed by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the solo comedy institution Carolines, is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year – along with more than sixty performances in small clubs and large theaters.
"Most of these titles have appeared in Carolines and have become successful to the point that they are too big to play in a club," Hirsch said.
We created this festival as an opportunity to continue working with them.
This year’s event includes performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher, as well as “Stand Up for Heroes,” an annual musical benefit performance at Madison Square Garden featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Co.
As this festival spread, so did the world of comedy.
Several comedians participating in this year's festival have emerged from non-traditional channels, such as shows in smaller radio or television companies, such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll got off to a great start with his sitcom (joyously spicy "League" on a fantastic football theme on FXX) and now has his own comedy show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was a member of both "Saturday night live" and "Parks and recreation", but she was most famous for her fast-spreading "Marcel the shell with shoes on" video series.
Both Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedians with clearly recognisable voices (surreally pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, rabid, racially focused W. Kamau Bell), are the product of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest drawers of the festival will be the interview: David Steinberg will talk to Larry David.
Steinberg began as a solo comedian, but became a successful television and film director, as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg.
The meeting takes place at Town Hall in downtown Manhattan.
"This city is definitely in the comedic DNA of all Larry's work," Steinberg said.
He told me that when he was here, he would sometimes walk down the street between the two buildings and say, "Man, if I lose all the money, maybe I'll live here."
The price of oil also fell to $96 per barrel.
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday, as concerns about high inventories were balanced by a report that showed a strengthening of China’s energy-hungry manufacturing sector.
The U.S. oil index for December deliveries during the late morning fell by 14 cents to $96.24 per barrel in European e-commerce on the New York Stock Exchange.
On Thursday, the drop was 39 cents and 5.8 percent for the month of October.
Rich oil reserves have been weighing on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said on Wednesday that U.S. inventories had increased by 4.1 million barrels in the past week.
In five weeks, inventories have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
On Friday, however, from two reports on Chinese production, there was a surge in demand, which showed growth in activity.
This suggests that China’s economic recovery could continue to strengthen after growth, which has soared to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after two weak decades.
Brent oil, an indicator for international oil also used by U.S. refineries, fell by 26 cents to $108.58 per barrel on the London International Trade Exchange.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
We have a unique opportunity to tell politicians that this is not the case.
It is necessary to develop such pressure that Martin Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is deprived of all political functions and leaves the parliamentary mandate.
Any other solution will reduce the level of political culture that is already so lousy.
Martin Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek shields himself with the promise he made, but everyone and politicians in particular must be aware of the consequences of the promise and be very careful about what can be promised.
Trust is the only capital that a politician has (Mr. Babi<0xC5><0xA1> also has the material capital, but the question is whether he is a politician).
The best program promoted by a liar is untrustworthy.
He does not apologize in politics, he backs down in politics.
Mr. Ha<0xC5><0xA1>k, if you mean it well with this country (and your frequent statements make me say it, so if you didn't lie - here you see how difficult lying is), you will leave politics alone, as a man.
People will then accept your apology as an expression of a man who made a mistake and bears his responsibility for it.
Otherwise, you will be perceived as a spineless weakling whose words and actions cannot be trusted.
You either want to be proud, whether you're a flawed person or a lifelong skeptic.
It may seem unfair to you to address only you, but you are the leader and they are only the misguided sheep.
And you're the leader, and you always wanted to be.
I understand that you are now trying to bend your ears for a moment, regroup your forces, sit down with that shame and then attack again, but that is how partisans or subversives behave.
You are, I repeat, in your eyes a leader, an alpha male, so act like it.
Take responsibility and walk away from politics.
The court blocked the regulations regarding the procedure of arresting and searching persons by the NY police department
The Federal Court of Appeal on Thursday blocked a court order seeking changes to the arrest and search program at the New York Police Department and dismissed the judge from the case.
A second U.S. federal appeals court said Judge Shira Scheindlin’s decision would be delayed until the city’s appeal decision.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution by implementing its program of stopping and questioning people.
The city thought of its conclusions and its amending regulations, including the decision to allocate supervision that would help the police department change its procedures and its training program associated with them.
On Tuesday, the Court of Appeal heard arguments for the requested postponement.
The Court of Appeal said the judge must be removed from the case because she came into conflict with the rules of conduct for the judge, by not acting as a judge on a request to avoid the appearance of entrepreneurship, in part because of a series of interviews with the media and public statements, which she openly reacted to.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people when they wrongly targeted blacks and Hispanics as part of their arrest and search program.
It established independent oversight to oversee major changes, including reform of procedures, training and oversight, and ordered the launch of a pilot programme to test body-worn cameras in some areas where people are most frequently stopped.
In August, New York City agreed to end the method of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases were denied after a police search.
The oral justification for the city’s appeal is sometimes scheduled after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of stopping and searching people have been criticized by a number of civil rights defenders.
In some form, there has been a halt and search of people for about a decade, but recorded searches under the administration of independent mayor Michael Bloomberg have dramatically increased to a record number of 684,330 in 2011, in most cases blacks and Hispanics.
In 2004, four men, all of whom are members of a minority group, filed a class action suit.
Proponents of the NY Police Department’s change to the Stop and Search program argue that the changes will end unfair practices, increase the credibility and effectiveness of the police force, and may affect how these practices are used by other police departments.
Opponents argue that the changes will reduce police morale, but not crime, and that this will waste money, but will not solve the wider problem when the police corps is under pressure after its numbers have been reduced by several thousand over the past decade.
The judge noted that she did not end the practice of stopping and searching for people, which is constitutional, but reformed the way the NY Police Department’s inspections were put in place.
One in five shopping malls are facing low traffic
This is according to Cushman & Wakefield and Jones Lang LaSalle.
The Krak<0xC3><0xB3>w Shopping Centre opens to the public in Prague’s Bohnice district and will be the 19th shopping centre in Prague.
There are now a total of 90 large shopping centers in the Czech Republic.
Unsatisfactory performance affects about 20 percent of medium-sized and large centers.
The main problems are inadequately large center in terms of location and poor layout, i.e. too many floors or complicated and opaque arrangement of passages, or possibly dead sites of centers," said Michal Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k of Cushman & Wakefield.
Also, according to the head of the retail property department Jones Lang LaSalle Sylvie Samadi, about a fifth of the malls face low attendance.
Among the main reasons are poor transport accessibility, low income category of local residents or overcrowding of the market in a given place.
Some of the projects opened up almost fully occupied, but their results were mostly unsatisfactory at first.
Nowadays, customers are somewhat conservative and do not like to change their shopping habits.
New business centers need to do more to 'attract' their customers to new brands in the market, entertainment, services and marketing events," added Samadi.
According to Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k, the occupancy of shopping centers is generally stable, even rising at some centers, because the tenants were willing to discount rent and rent some units in the crisis.
"It is true, however, that some projects have recently opened, which are not fully occupied and thus reduce the average occupancy (for example, Breda & Weinstein in Opava, <0xC5><0xA0>antovka in Olomouc), "said Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k.
According to Sylvia Samadi, the shopping centres opened in the last two years are progressing very slowly in the market.
But there is a place on the market for new projects.
The number of places suitable for the construction of a successful project is very limited.
For example, in Prague we see space for the construction of a project that would serve the inhabitants of Prague 6.
There is certainly room on the market for the construction of smaller local projects, so-called 'convinience centres', aimed at the purchase and service of daily necessities for the population living in the immediate vicinity," Samadi said.
Also, according to Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k, there is a place for other shopping centers on the domestic market.
Whether for small 'service' centres, for large projects in Prague, or medium-sized projects, or extensions in regional cities.
"Cities like Kladno, <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice, Brno or Pilsen have room for further growth," Sot<0xC3><0xA1>k added.
In Prague, he sees the space for the prepared shopping center on V<0xC3><0xAD>tezn<0xC3><0xA1> n<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC4><0x9B>st<0xC3><0xAD>, and according to him, the streets Na P<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>kop<0xC4><0x9B> and Wenceslas Square have a clear potential.
"Intensively developing expansion of retail parks, which allow merchants to cover and expand to increasingly smaller cities, at favorable rent and operating costs, the space is also still in some locations for smaller local or residential shopping centers, respectively, their reconstruction as well as the reconstruction of the commercial buildings.
In the Czech Republic, there are currently 90 modern shopping centers with a total of more than 2.2 million square meters of gross rental area.
A quarter of all these shopping malls are located in Prague.
Among the 20 largest shopping centers, according to the number of tenants, nine of them are in Prague, according to the data of Incoma GfK.
In the number of shopping parks, the Czech Republic is below the EU average, compared to values from Britain and France, the Czech Republic is behind by about 50 square meters per thousand inhabitants.
Coulson broke into the phone to check his tip
Former News of the World (NotW) editor Andy Coulson allegedly used methods of “phone tapping, tracking, and confrontation” to confirm a fraudulent tip on the love affair in which then-minister of the interior Charles Clarke was to be involved.
State Attorney Andrew Edis told the Old Bailey court that the News of the World had caught false reports in May 2005 that Clarke had been seen with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pawlby.
The papers ordered private investigator Glenn Mulcaier to break into Pawlby's voicemail and break into her privacy, but the court heard that Coulson had also called her and left her voicemails.
“The D.A. suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor of NotW, is not the man who stands in front of the house and hopes to catch people outside, but the man who likes to tell people stories to see what they’re going to say,” Mr. Edis said.
He said the NotW newspaper used three ways of exploring stories: hacking into the phone, watching, and confronting.
The editor is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the other, watching, he needs to know about it.
What about the first one?
Does he know about breaking into the phone?
He says no, we say, "But of course he knows."
The love affair that Clarke is involved in was first captured by the NotW newsroom when a source who was sexually interested in Ms. Pawlby was told, “You’re just wasting your time, she’s with Charles.”
A recording of voice messages taken from her phone on at least three occasions was obtained at Mulcarro's house in August 2006.
Investigators also found the records on a private investigator’s computer, where Ms. Pawlby and her sister were referred to as “Projects.”
During the time that Mrs. Pawlby was being investigated, her grandparents received anonymous phone calls asking for information about Pawlby, Mr. Edis said.
Meanwhile, former chief rapporteur Neville Thurlbeck and former rapporteur James Weatherup were watching Ms. Pawlby's movement.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voice message in which he told her, “I got a story that we’re going to tell tomorrow that I’d love to talk to Charles about.”
Mr. Edis says Coulson's involvement in the story was on the same model as other prominent figures, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The court heard on Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett over a love affair with a married woman while he himself was seeing co-defendant Rebecca Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks denied colluding with other people in order to hack into the phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup confessed to breaking into the phone.
The NSA’s disclosure increases the state’s social paranoia of surveillance
One quiet day at the end of August, a German police helicopter was buzzing over the US consular office in Frankfurt, the capital of the German economy.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German domestic intelligence agency, the mission was to take photographs of the roof of the US-led patrol, which is located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
German media have claimed that the BfV office hoped to be able to identify the presence of wiretapping antennas, and the event launched an exchange of views between the US and German foreign ministers in Berlin.
James Clapper, the U.S. director of national intelligence, reiterated in September that the U.S. is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities “to steal the trade secrets of foreign companies for the benefit of U.S. companies, thereby enhancing their international competitiveness or increasing their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, who became an informant from a co-worker, began revealing his treasure trove of covert surveillance by the United States, European governments and leading businessmen no longer know whether to trust the CEO’s words.
After reports that the U.S. National Security Agency was spying on a Brazilian oil company and gaining access to data at the disposal of U.S. cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, it has reached a general paranoia about state surveillance of new dimensions.
The final straw came with the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone may have been tapped for ten years.
If he can be the target of the most powerful person in Europe, then they are certainly the potential target of even the leading entrepreneurs.
Snowden made clear the intense cooperation between the U.S. intelligence services and companies.
I would say that it is possible that these data are used for mutual benefit.
"Germany has to wake up," said Oliver Gr<0xC3><0xBC>n, president of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
According to a survey released in July by the EY advisory service, German companies are convinced that in terms of industrial espionage and data theft, the US now poses as much risk as China.
However, there is no evidence so far in all the documentation Mr. Snowden uncovered that the United States was passing trade secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concerns that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities, and said they should try to limit their dependence on the US:
Leading entrepreneurs are sceptical about this.
The German parliament has voiced the opinion that we should make a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and slowly open them again...
This is not the way, says Hasso Plattner, chairman of the German software company SAP.
If anyone wanted a strong European IT industry, they shouldn’t have let him die 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidised, from coal to cars and farmers.
Everything except the IT industry.
The scale and technical sophistication of the U.S. spy agencies uncovered by Snowden is shocking to some companies who previously thought China posed the biggest threat from surveillance.
There is a major shift in cloud computing, where European leaders have become more aware of the fact that data stored in the U.S. is under U.S. jurisdiction and therefore potentially objectionable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance business community, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members canceled plans to use a U.S.-based cloud provider after the U.S. Prism data mining program was revealed.
Jim Snabe, one of the CEOs of SAP, says: “We have this new question for customers who weren’t here a year ago – where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will physically stay in this jurisdiction?”
Many German high officials argue that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew: that powerful states want to steal their most valuable secrets and that these data must be protected at all costs.
The fact that economic espionage is being carried out is no surprise.
It's always happened.
“It’s been an important topic for many years and it hasn’t changed significantly even during the current discussion,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of agrochemical company BASF.
Americans are spying on us on a commercial and industrial level, just as we are spying on them because it is in our national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders in general do not want to boast of countermeasures, which they did, so as not to give an advantage to the attacker.
In the case of large companies, it has long been recalled that taking a free USB memory drive to the fair or leaving an unprotected laptop in the hotel room is at least unreasonable.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of Audi, says that it has been a common practice for many years to collect mobile phones before the board meeting so that they cannot be used as a listening device.
The German BfV advises executives to consider not using simple prepaid mobile phones on foreign trips because of the risk that smartphones can be misappropriated.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized enterprises will continue to be vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are leading the global market in their specific areas.
“Small and medium-sized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect corporate secrets against unauthorized access,” BfV said in its report.
The U.S. is warning its own companies against economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, U.S. National Intelligence Estimate documents listed France, along with Russia and Israel, in the second row in February as perpetrators who engage in hacking activity for economic reporters, just outside China.
A board member at a German risk-free society concluded that, as far as economic espionage is concerned, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French domestic intelligence agency DCRI, said in one of the interviews this month: “The services know quite well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
The parents of a Georgia boy who died in a strange accident believe he was murdered.
Parents of a Georgia boy whose body was found inside a shrouded fighting spirit at his high school gym believe their son was murdered, a family lawyer said on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found slumped in a straight spirit behind the grandstands of the gymnasium he attended on January 11.
Sheriff's investigators in Lowndes County have concluded that Johnson died by accident, but the family of a 17-year-old boy denies it.
“They are clearly convinced that their son was murdered,” lawyer Benjamin Crump, who represents Kenneth and Jacqueline Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never believed he died the way the sheriff said.
“They are convinced that this contradicts logic, physical laws, and common sense,” Crump said.
They believe that this should be used to cover up what really happened in order to protect the person responsible for the death of their son.
"As usual, they sent their son to school and he came back in their body bag," he said.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said on Thursday he was conducting a routine investigation into Johnson’s death, noting that several key questions remained unanswered.
What was the cause of death?
Was his death a result of a crime?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I will follow the facts wherever they lead me.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I am of the opinion that there is a sufficient basis for a regular investigation," he said.
Moore told reporters that the original autopsy indicated that Johnson had died as a result of "field suffocation."
However, according to Moore, the second autopsy revealed a different cause of death.
"There are a few questions that need to be answered or confirmed," he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers enough evidence to warrant an investigation of a crime or a civil rights violation in Johnson’s case, he will ask the FBI and its enforcement.
A deputy sheriff's office in Lowndes County was not immediately available for comment on Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to make available all videos from surveillance cameras that investigators had viewed.
The teen’s parents hope the videos will contain a trail leading to the discovery of how their son died.
The CDC has issued guidelines for schools on allergies in children.
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) issued a set of guidelines to help children with food allergies at school.
This is the first set of such guidelines issued by the U.S. government, due to the increasing number of school-age children suffering from food allergies.
One in 20 children in the United States has a food allergy.
The CDC found that the incidence of food allergies in children increased by 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines provide schools with information on how to alert teachers and staff to children’s food allergies and how to respond to an allergic reaction, if any.
It also recommends that schools have adrenaline at their disposal – most often using an EpiPen auto-injector – to be able to respond to potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity.
The state legislature has recently updated rules that allow schools to store adrenaline more easily.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms appearing in conversations with children who have an allergic reaction.
A child may say, "It's like someone's pricking my tongue," "I feel like I have hair on my tongue," or "My tongue hurts."
Parents of intersex children can choose "indeterminate sex"
Germany has become the first European nation to recognize the third sex of children born with ambiguous sexual orientation.
Newborn babies will no longer be classified as either male or female.
The new law does not require parents to name any gender for such children, and allows them to name gender as “indeterminate” or “unspecified” on their birth certificates.
The aim of the law is to stop pressuring parents to suddenly decide on an operation for the purpose of determining the sex of their child, and to fight against discrimination against those who are intersex.
One intersex person, according to the BBC, said after many years: “I am neither a man nor a woman.”
I'll stay a mess created by a doctor, bruised and scarred.
It is estimated that every year out of 2,000 children, one is born that is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, part of a group of about 60 facts that fall under the diagnosis of sexual development disorders, a cover-up term for those who have atypical chromosomes, sex glands (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed genitalia.
Intersex could have been Wallis Simpson.
Sex determination is not yet fully understood, but most experts in the United States say that when it is not possible to determine the sex, it is better to use the best available information and determine them, rather than waiting and watching the psychological and physical development of the child until the surgery is performed, if at all.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender issues, said the new German law “looks like a good thing.”
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
“Some people are in a life-threatening condition that requires surgery, but most children are not,” he said.
Sex determination can be done without surgery and then you can wait for the identity to develop.
Knowledge of how a child's sexual orientation develops is not very accurate.
No one can answer the question of why this is happening.
It's like a mystery why some people are gay.
A report submitted to the European Committee in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people because their status is not tied to gender, but to their biological structure, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically deals with both and cannot be clearly defined as either.
These features can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle volume, hair growth, breasts and figure, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and sexual organs, or in the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
This report also provides an overview of the discrimination experienced by intersex and transsexual people in the workplace, as well as the levels of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't fit any gender now have a special camp.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to identify male, female or “third gender” in official documents.
Norrie May-Welby, a 52-year-old Australian, became the world’s first recognized “sexless” person in June when she won a court appeal to retain her status as an “indefinite” sex for the rest of her life.
According to the Ministry of the Interior, German passports, in addition to M (male) and F (female), will also have a third designation, X, for intersex persons.
In neighbouring France, the gender issue is still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from this heavily Catholic country signed a petition to remove “gender theory” from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online also defined itself against German law and wrote: “With the world being dragged into a new state where sex is a matter of choice, but not sexual activity, we are turning two other pillars of civilization upside down.”
One mother, a newborn from Maryland, also told Baby Zone that she would rather see the babies assigned sex at birth.
“Parenting is stressful even without any other restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she told parenting websites.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children with both male and female sex were called hermaphrodites, according to the handsome Greek, who had a double sex.
And about ten years ago, the medical community thought that sex was something like a tablet that could be erased and re-drawn.
But now many question the ethical basis of the operation with the fact that sexual affiliation is a complex matter and doctors can sometimes make the wrong decision because they do not know how, given their gender, children will feel when they grow up.
"In the middle of the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency," Drescher said.
When these children were born, you didn't call a psychiatrist, you called a surgeon.
Persistent theories about how to treat children with ambiguous sex were put forward by Dr. John Money at Johns Hopkins University, who held the view that sex is subservient.
He created a new concept of “gender identity” and argued that social causes and environmental influences – how parents raised their child – affected the child’s genes and hormones and formed the child regardless of whether it was identified as a man or a woman.
But in a 1966 case known as “John/Joan,” his theory became controversial.
He recommended that the parents of the boy, whose penis was damaged due to a badly performed circumcision, let their child be completely castrated, remove his testicles and raise him as a girl.
“The media presented this case as a successful case of transformation, but the reality was different,” Drescher said.
When the boy was 15, he had his surgery back on the boy and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “use this model” to this day.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these operations found themselves “dissatisfied with the outcome.”
It was also the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with male chromosomes but an ambiguous sex drive.
Doctors weren’t sure if he had a big clitoris or a small penis, and they were convinced that as a man he could never live a “satisfactory life.”
And so shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce had his external organs and testicles surgically removed and was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was very hard to ask.
At 18 he was sent to the vagina plastic.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he asked for medical records.
What he found was terrifying.
After I was born, I was sterilized and no one ever told me anything.
Bruce was born with a sex development disorder (DSD), which prevented the body from producing enough testosterone to properly develop his sex drive.
After learning the truth, he turned back on the man, took testosterone doses and had his breast removed,
The surgery caused his infertility.
Today, she represents others in an organization called the Interface Project and seeks to normalize the perception of those who are intersex.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, the legal director of California-based Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that the German law “calls for stigmatization.”
“Many activists fear that the German law will achieve that it will encourage parents to make quick decisions and choose ‘uncertain’ ones for the child,” she said.
We're afraid it'll encourage intervention.
We think it is better to assign male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know what the law will ultimately sound like, so all we can do is speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be classified as a third gender.”
"Adults should be able to make their own decisions about the legally valid sex," she said.
The German law is about to assign it at birth.
This is a battle that a little child should not be led to at this moment.
When they grow up, they can make their own decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a chest radiologist from Pittsburgh who has a daughter with a sexual development disorder and is helping hundreds of others in the support group, said the German law would “grant authority” to both parents and children.
Baratz's daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but has DSD called androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Because her androgen receptors are defective, Katie's female traits have evolved.
She has a vagina, but she doesn't have a uterus and ovaries.
Now 29-year-old Katie is married and working as an intern in child psychiatry as part of her studies at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although infertile, she hopes to become a parent through adoption or surrogacy.
"The law will give parents some space not to rush their decision," Baratz said.
It gives them time to do certain tests and think about it, and it gives them time to write “man” or “woman.”
In this regard, everything is fine – you raise your child and love him.
You have a wonderful child and you are happy about it.
You don’t have to rush into an operation that is irreversible.
“It brings the opportunity to involve the child in decision-making and removes the anxiety that binds parents because they’re not sure they’re doing the right thing,” she said.
In the end, the child decides which gender he or she identifies with the most – and that’s a great thing.
This gives children the power to make their own decisions.
The drunkard poured gasoline on the whole house: he threatened to set it on fire with his own family!
Tension was rising, fear was rising.
The man began to threaten to set the whole house on fire.
All available police patrols in the area, as well as a fire brigade from Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> Boleslav and a volunteer fire brigade, went to the site.
A police negotiator arrived at the scene, who tried to explain his irrational behavior to the man.
The man threatened to burn the house down.
The house had to be penetrated by an intervention unit, which destroyed the man and chained him.
The aggressor then ended up being examined in a young Boleslav hospital, from where he was transferred to an anti-alcohol seizure station.
Firefighters eventually filled the house with gasoline with sorbents, which they later cleaned up.
In addition to the people, all the animals were rescued from the house.
The man did not give up on the police negotiator, so the command went after him.
Report: Obama’s Campaign Considered Swapping Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest adviser, according to the New York Times, was secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden’s 2012 nominee with Hillary Clinton.
This revelation is the most significant sensation of the eagerly awaited 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double down: Game Change 2012.”
The Times magazine obtained a copy of the upcoming book and announced on Thursday evening that the president’s top aides had held intensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 to gauge whether getting rid of Biden would help revive Obama’s fading hope of a resurgence.
According to the national-political correspondent for the Times, Jonathan Martin, the book offers a thorough record of the efforts of senior officials inside the campaign and in the White House, namely former White House chief of staff Bill Daley, to measure what effect vice-chancellors should have on the election.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the Chicago infrastructure of the campaign and inside the Oval Office.
Only a few of the president’s closest advisers — including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina, and former White House chief advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew this change was under consideration.
The book "Double down" claims that Daley was the representative of the attempt to replace Biden, despite their close personal relationship, until they finally decided not to make this move, when the data showed that adding Clinton to the candidacy would "not significantly increase Obama's chances."
In an interview with Martin Daley, he confirmed that the administration was indeed considering replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I've researched a lot of things intensively, and this was one of them," Daley told the paper.
You must not forget that at that time the president had terrible prospects, so we were like, "Christopher, what are we to do?"
While Daley characterized the research as “due diligence,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested considerable effort to determine whether the move would pay off in the election.
“The campaign doesn’t spend that kind of money on elections and qualitative research if something isn’t really being seriously considered,” Martin told AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was considering this exchange.
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his boss at the time knew about this potential mix of cards.
While Daley said he didn’t think the president was “aware” of the potential changes, the former head of the office admitted it was “possible” that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that the book "Double down" definitely doesn't answer the question of whether the political probe got as far as Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama didn’t know about the investigation into Biden’s removal from the race.
"Perhaps," Martin replied.
Fantastic ice cream that glows in the dark?
The British entrepreneur made the first ice cream that glows in the dark – using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis used the fluorescence properties of this marine animal and developed a luminous halo.
He came up with the idea when he read a professional treatise on jellyfish, and persuaded scientists in China to chemically make a protein that causes lightening.
This ice cream reacts with the language of the consumer – it increases the pH level in the protein and subsequently causes its radiation.
Chris says that ice cream glows when it reacts with the warmth of your mouth, and therefore the more you lie down, the brighter it glows.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company "Lick me I'm delicious", says: "It's an amazing fabric, but when it comes to production, we're at the beginning, so for <0xC2><0xA3>200 you get about 2 g of this fabric."
The protein we use in ice cream reacts with your tongue at a neutral pH.
So as your mouth heats up the protein, the pH level rises and the ice cream starts to glow.
We tested it over the last few months and it seems to be a great idea to celebrate Halloween because it causes this fantastic glowing effect.
It’s probably the most expensive ice cream I’ve ever made, because jellyfish lighting is four times more expensive than gold.
So every hill costs me about 140 GBP.
But it tastes great.
Charlie’s experimental Bristol-based company is known for its unconventional flavors of beer, cheese, beef, and gold leaf.
But his next product is supposed to be even more ambitious.
He says, "I'd really like to make an invisible ice cream."
In essence, this is impossible because of the breakage of light caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I am counting on finding some way to do it.
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish, artificially made by Chinese scientists.
Halloween 2013: By Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were able to eat sweets, stay up long and show off to our neighbors in disguise.
Today I feel like I have become a caretaker.
After two years there was no sugar in my apartment and this year it will probably not be different.
However, statistics show that I am, as far as Halloween is concerned, a black sheep.
According to the National Retail Federation (NRF), this year most Americans will celebrate Halloween – in fact, 158 million of them – and spend a total of $6.9 billion on sweets, costumes and decorations.
But what I always look forward to about Halloween are the trends.
According to the NRF, of the $6.9 billion spent, $1.2 billion is expected to go towards costumes.
This year are the last shot of fashion sexy inanimate objects.
It’s not just women who can be sexy; it’s also foods like pizza, hamburger, and carrots that can be sexy.
As for the men, I expect to see a lot of zombies through the parade of the dead, and I bet the space men from Daft Punk will reach out to our Instagram channels this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with going by tradition.
Last year we dressed our dogs in costumes and to my surprise we were not the only ones.
In fact, according to the NRF, Americans will spend $330 million this year on pet costumes.
So he'll see a lot of funny dogs.
When it comes to sweets, we don’t waste time.
According to Nielsen, Americans will spend $1.9 billion.
That's about 300 million pounds of Hershey's tablets, lollipops, candy Milk Duds and Twizzlers, and Clark's stick.
That’s great news for the 41 million coworkers who, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce, are about to storm our neighborhood.
In fact, during Halloween, we buy, and believe it or not, we consume, 45 million pounds of chocolate.
The only thing we don’t want are corn candies, and yet, according to the National Association of Sugar candies, nearly 16,000 tons are sold around Halloween.
That's about 9 billion individual corn candies.
That's a secret I've never let go of.
Nothing is more typical for Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror behind the walls", "Howl-O-Scream", and "The house of shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially dedicated haunted houses in the United States that have a profit of $500 million, according to the American haunted house company, and that includes those amazing photos that you're terrified of and that your friend will give on Facebook, and you can't get rid of them, and that person will be happy to see you.
And finally, a little bit about pumpkins.
When we were little, Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin, and carving the pumpkin lantern is like decorating a Christmas tree – we’ve been doing it since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the “baby in the pumpkin” trend started with the Pinterest app only last year, so most of us grew up cutting the pumpkin instead of sitting in it.
This year, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins.
The pumpkin lantern with a flickering flame on your front porch probably comes from Illinois, where this year 245 thousand tons of pumpkins have grown.
If you’re looking for something extra, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon from Napa, California, and try to slice their pumpkin weighing nearly one ton.
Announced series of racing Land Rovers
The interior has racing seats and six-point safety belts, as well as intercom equipment.
The choice includes improved brakes, a service package providing access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistical support and storage of the vehicle between individual plants.
Drew Bowler, technical director of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The race participants who come to Bowler have changed.”
Not all are experienced racers, but they are people who want excitement and adventure and also an achievable path to world-class racing.
We are pleased to be able to offer them this journey in collaboration with Land Rover and MSA, and we believe that this format offers a new way to experience the various racing disciplines in the UK and overseas, and that it will prepare competitors for the rigor and reality of Rally Raid racing.
We really enjoyed the development of the Defender Challenge car – it will be a really exciting competition.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February, as well as the opportunity to compete in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Schwarzenberg: We have an early election in two years
President of TOP 09 Karel Schwarzenberg is expecting another early election soon.
A week after the last in an interview for Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz said that there is no other way out and every government emerged from the vote last Friday and Saturday is an impossible deadlock.
"It can't last long," said Karel Schwarzenberg, adding that he estimates the lifetime of the beginning of the election period to be two years.
With the objection that voters next time will hardly choose any other way, they disagree: "I think it will be a little more balanced decision-making."
At the same time, the president of TOP 09 does not allow his party to lose voters in the next elections like this year (it lost about 300 thousand votes compared to 2010).
Schwarzenberg estimates that if it were clear within two months that early elections would be held, it would strengthen the YES 2011 movement of Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Otherwise, according to Schwarzenberg, Grandfather will lose.
The turbulent situation in <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, where President Bohuslav Sobotka after a secret meeting of the party leadership declared that he or Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek will remain in the leadership of the social democracy, Schwarzenberg comments in his own words:
“Leaders of the Democratic Party like little boys go after the head of state to allow them a coup in the party.”
"I thought Mr. Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek was cleverer and more intelligent."
"Because I've never seen anything so unexpectedly badly done in my life," added the Chairman of TOP 09.
And to President Zeman (with whom he clashed in the struggle for the presidency) he said: "The role of the head of state is clear: He wants to take over that side."
The first laws have already been submitted to the TOP 09.
What was the biggest surprise of the election?
The TOP 09 has already formally submitted its first bills in the House, including the Farsky Register of Treaties, which was discussed by the House committees before the elections, but fell under the table with early elections.
The president of TOP 09 in an interview for Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz claims that such speed is given by the fact that "these laws are needed".
At the same time, however, TOP 09 apparently wants to overtake similar attempts by other parties.
For example, election leader of the YES movement Martin Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rek accused TOP 09 in the pre-election fight of the idea of introducing a register of contracts "stealing" the YES movement's program.
The TOP 09 has now taken advantage of the lead - it just dusted off a proposal that had already been advanced to the second reading of the House.
Firefighters have come to rescue a lost puppy that has been trapped 15 meters above the ground at a dangerous protrusion in a quarry
The cockroach Ruby ran away after a small car accident.
Three days later, a man who was walking a dog saw him trapped in a quarry.
Firefighters went to the rock wall to save the dog from certain death.
The puppy was rescued by fire units who came to rescue him after he somehow trapped himself on a dangerous ledge in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
Ruby, a nine-month-old cockroach, escaped after a small car accident on Sunday afternoon, and survived three days alone until he was released from a quarry on Wednesday.
Its owners Scott Alderson (25) and his girlfriend Becky Hall (20) were at the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to reunite with Ruby and to thank the fire and rescue service from West Yorkshire.
After escaping when he got into a small accident, they scoured the world for their lost dog and placed challenges on social media.
At about 2.15 p.m. on Wednesday, a bright-eyed dog-sitter saw Ruby trapped in a quarry 15 meters above the ground.
At the scene, a technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station rushed down to free Ruby, using an animal carrier to pick him up on the rock.
Andy Clayton, the technical rescue team’s chief of staff, said: “The dog was in a dangerous situation.
It was right in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and from below.
He did not move his eyebrows in the rescue – he was totally frozen.
He's all right now.
Then he got cookies.
It was a very unusual outing.
The fact that someone saw the dog is incredible.
Peter Lau, an expert commander of the technical rescue team, said: “Ruby was very lucky during his escape.”
There was a possibility that he would be very seriously injured or even worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a tour, and in addition to exhaustion and dehydration, he was fine.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “I was afraid when I saw the rescue.
First of all, I couldn't believe how he got there.
It was great to have him in my arms again.
The vet said that if he got too exhausted and collapsed, he'd probably fall.
Firefighters did a great job.
What they did was very brave.
We are very grateful to them, they were all just amazing.
Mr Alderson of Keighley added, “We were afraid it might fall, but it stayed there.”
Firefighters were great.
We just still don't understand how he got there.
Mick Jagger claims that Katy Perry did not go out after 18.
During an interview with Australian radio this week, the pop star said she sang backing vocals for Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits Die Hard".
Perry said that when she was 18, she was having dinner with this rock veteran, and he went after her.
And she added, "It was a long time ago and now he's very nice to me."
In a statement Thursday, Jagger's (70) deputy said he categorically refuses to ever make Katy Perry proposals.
The deputy said, "Maybe he's messing with someone else."
Perry was one of the guest singers who appeared on the Rolling Stones concert line this year.
Her new album “Prism” debuted at number one this week.
George Kerevan: Divided Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another horror story of independence.
This time there is a warning that the condition for an independent Scotland to join the EU would be its entry into Schengen.
This gave rise to stories of passport checks in Berwick and barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
The truth is that Strathclyde mentioned the possible economic benefits of free movement with the rest of Europe, but – as might be expected – this did not appear in the headlines.
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU Member States spend a lot of time adapting their official laws, if they so wish.
Given that Scotland is not now in Schengen, the offer of continued non-compliance would be a cheap concession for Brussels in return for whatever they really want from the Scots.
So it's a pretty weak story.
In addition, so old that it became an excavation. A journalistic duck, that “independence means passport control”, I heard at least 40 years ago.
Yet in this bearded tale lies one interesting idea.
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to listen to Europe in the first place?
Why trade the London Chomout for the Brussels Chomout, especially now?
This is the real European story: the great post-war plan to unify Europe has finally collapsed.
The so-called Project Europe is officially dead due to the euro crisis.
Across Europe, they gain the influence of a dedicated party of resistance to the EU or the abolition of the euro as a common currency.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party – founded this year – came out of nowhere and already used almost five million votes in the September federal elections, essentially “throwing out” the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
On home soil, there has always been opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has become a decisive moment.
The austerity dictated by Germany and the European Central Bank, together with a tightening of the national economy by clinging to the common currency, have led many people to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments managing a high budget deficit – this was true only in the case of Greece.
Rather, it is a system of the euro that blocks its members at exchange rates favorable to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the domestic currency, southern Europe has a disadvantage in terms of domestic production compared to Germany.
The only way to do this is to cut revenues and public spending, which Germany is calling for.
The current problems with the budget and the currency are the root cause of Europe’s poor performance.
As a result of the “green” energy policy supported by Brussels – a code to support French and German companies at the expense of consumers – the European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times more for gasoline than it does in the United States.
This is a paralyzing disadvantage in terms of costs, as we have already seen in the case of Grangemouth.
Not even any wage freeze in the world would prevent Europe’s petrochemical industry from suffocating with cheap shale oil from the US.
The result is a stifling revolt, especially in France, once an enthusiastic supporter of the EU.
After the war, the political elite in France saw the EU as a tool that would keep Germany on the cusp and allow Paris to rise to the level of Washington in the world.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a sign of political legitimacy, and it has pursued its own economic policy in Europe and left the worn-out French economy to its fate.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s right wing, the anti-European National Front, just won a crucial additional election and pushed the ruling socialists to third place.
The Front is now France’s most popular party with 24% of the vote – an early warning to British Labour that they cannot assume that the split of the right will automatically manifest itself positively on the left.
How does Le Pen handle its newly acquired popularity among the white working class?
The European elections next year would like to use it to create an anti-European bloc against the single currency across the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties do well in this election, which is likely, such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time in history.
At the same time, I think that the growing anti-European feeling and attitude against the single currency will unite and destroy the euro in the foreseeable future.
The EU will not disappear, but rather transform itself into something more free in the sense of “Europe of (sovereign) nations” as preferred by General de Gaulle.
Germany and several of its satellite economies may retain the euro, but France and southern Europe will restore their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project and stick to the United States.
However, Washington’s increased interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be left to the Atlantic cold.
Where will Scotland be?
We can choose to be an area (in principle) of Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – this includes the possibility of announcing to Berlin and Brussels when they are going to let us be.
I assume that Scotland would do well in the relaxed organisation of Europe, provided that it kept its own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should take the example of Norway and maintain our economic independence.
Scotland’s SNP government is – oddly enough – the most successful political movement not pursuing austerity measures in Europe, which won a large majority in 2011 thanks to the opposition’s stance against austerity planned (and implemented) by Labour Chancellor Alistair Darling and the subsequent coalition of conservatives and liberators.
It would be ridiculous if Scotland now voted for independence just to take the austerity measures dictated by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Early Adulthood
Research has shown that African-Americans and Hispanics reach puberty earlier than their white peers.
Physical Changes Don't Mean Puberty is Approaching
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are behind this.
Experts claim that one of the triggers of earlier puberty may be an epidemic of obesity.
The trend of earlier puberty is not so noticeable in boys.
Former CNN reporter Pat Etheridge is a journalist who specializes in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be horrified when her daughter starts growing breasts and pubic hair at the age of 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these physical changes are quite common among American girls and represent a new standard.
"I spent a lot of time making sure my parents that this is not usually a sign of rapid development towards full puberty," Kaplowitz said.
Visible signs of development, such as breast growth, pubic and armpit hair and body odor, appear earlier in girls.
In the last 40 years, however, there has been only a small shift in the age at which the first menstruation occurs.
In the United States, the average age is now 12.5 years compared to 12.75 years in 1970.
“When the breasts start to develop, it will take at least two to three years before the first menstruation occurs,” said Kaplowitz, who is also the author of “Early puberty in girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
The most reliable test of how puberty will continue is time.
It is discussed what activates the real onset of puberty, but if breast growth is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of 8, the girl is considered "premature".
In most cases, the process slows down or stops – which can be closely monitored by pediatricians.
Faster growth may be the reason for the endocrinologist to perform tests in order to rule out serious problems, such as a tumor or cyst.
There are treatment procedures that delay early menstruation and prevent further consequences: premature aging of the bones, which can eventually lead to the cessation of growth and cramping in adulthood.
Recommendations regarding medication and hormonal treatment depend on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and emotional maturity.
Psychosociological aspects are also important.
As for the use of drugs, Kaplowitz is cautious, but acknowledges that "the suppression of puberty can alleviate the problems with the girl's behavior and her feelings that she is different from her peers."
Understandably, there is another big problem: Parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have menstruation.
"They're worried that she might get pregnant, or how she'll handle hygiene," Kaplowitz said.
"It was a shock," recalls one woman whose daughter started menstruating at the age of 10.
Although there were indications and we talked about menstruation together, she was not prepared emotionally.
She came home from school scared and angry that she was the first of her friends.
There are many well-known theories about the causes of premature puberty.
However, there is still no consistent body of evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are to blame.
Boys – just like girls – reach puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most important reason is the obesity epidemic.
In 2001, he helped conduct a study on girls aged 6 to 9, which linked body fat with puberty timing.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other contributing factors.
In this country, African-Americans and Hispanics tend to reach puberty earlier than their white counterparts.
The explanations are different.
From a global perspective, early puberty patterns seem to be affected by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another puzzle: Although hair loss in the face and in the face appears in boys at a young age, the trend towards full bloom of early puberty is not as clear as it is in girls.
Other physicians attending the American Association of Pediatric Physicians (AAP) conference added further complexity to the topic.
Acne and pubic hair is common even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the actual onset of puberty,” said Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to get instructions from their child’s doctor on how to talk to their child.
"It can mean having to talk to the baby before you know it," Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will probably react well.
Girls who develop earlier need reassurance that even if this happens prematurely, this process is a common part of life.
Na<0xC4><0x8F>a Konvalinkov<0xC3><0xA1> in the role of hostess.
He's got a new job?
Actress Na<0xC4><0x8F>a Konvalinkov<0xC3><0xA1> (62) appeared behind the scenes in the role of a farmer and she was very successful.
Would a popular Czech actress plan to change her profession and start a business in a pub?
Nadja Konvalink appeared in the James Joyce Irish pub and made a beer there.
I did it for the first time in my life, and I did it right away.
Even my boss offered me a job and I could feed myself by turning a beer.
But I refused, I prefer to stay with what I do to this day, with acting," said Konvalink, who was a guest on the 20th anniversary of the Irish pub.
"I like Irish beer and I'm going to have Irish whiskey here," the actress said.
Nadi, a long-time friend and colleague Pavel Nov<0xC3><0xBD>, also appeared at the event.
I am after death and in the present new life I am not allowed to drink.
I'm allowed one beer or one drink a day, and I'm trying to stick to that," he said.
Aircraft manufacturers are complaining about the width of the seats, there are large orders at stake
A dispute over the width of second-class seats on long-haul flights has flared up among leading aircraft manufacturers, prompting a bitter exchange of views at the Dubai air show this month.
The subject of the dispute is the width of seats provided on long-haul flights for the economy class – not exactly the one that airlines would normally have preferred, but whose allocated space is key to the efficiency claims on the latest aircraft offered by Airbus SAS and Boeing.
Airbus this week called for industry standards that would offer at least 46 cm wide seats in the economy class, but the main US rival Boeing says it is to be decided by the airlines.
The dispute arose at a time when aircraft manufacturers were competing in the sale of the largest version of their two-engined long-haul aircraft with a potential record number of orders expected during the event from November 17 to 21.
The way in which the rear of the aircraft is spread out – especially if there are 9 or 10 seats next to each other – is the basis of the economic performance claims on the design of the new “mini-jumbo” aircraft.
Boeing says the upgraded 777X will carry 406 people in economy seats with a width of more than 43 cm spread over 10 in each row.
Airbus says a competitive version of its A350 will carry 350 people in 46-cm wide economy seats spread over 9 seats.
Giant aircraft often attack each other on technical issues through advertisements in professional media.
Airbus is now appealing directly to the public ahead of an air show in Dubai, where the 777X is expected to gain dominance with more than 100 orders.
Recently, he showed what could be the start of a new advertising war when he showed financiers a picture of three people in a restaurant with the caption “Would you like it?”
“Boeing is promoting long-haul flights in seats smaller than those in regional turboprop aircraft,” said Airbus Chief Sales Officer John Leahy.
As the eating habits change, people are bigger, but the seats on planes have not changed radically.
Since the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul air travel, by the turn of the century, according to the U.S. Department of Health, the weight of the average American between the ages of 40 and 49 has increased by 10 percent.
According to American health statistics, the average American in the 21st century has a waist 100 cm.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to the concept of seats from the 1950s, when the average seat width of a newly-baptized aircraft was lower.
Airbus says it has carried out research that suggests a 2.5-cm seat extension will improve sleep quality by 53 percent.
Boeing denies the size of Airbus’ seats and says it is not in the power of aircraft manufacturers to decide how airlines export fees and equipment.
The company also says research shows that the cabin experience depends on more things than just the width of the seat.
“It’s really about giving airlines flexibility and allowing them to do things they believe they have to do to be successful,” said cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us to dictate to them what profits bring.
They know their business better than anyone else.
More elbow space is essential for the passenger, but for the supplier it is a growing problem that can affect the returns.
Behind this dispute is a plant in the orders of aircraft with an estimated trade in the coming decades worth at least $700 billion in catalog prices, enough to deflect the tongue of the scales of American and European exports.
As Reuters reported in July, the seating arrangement is exactly what drives the battle between the last planes.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to achieve 20 percent better efficiency in their latest twin-engine long-haul aircraft designs than the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER model with 365 seats.
Boeing’s performance requirements depend in part on a comparison of the design of the 777X with 10 seats in a row and the 777 concept with 9 seats in a row.
The profit in unit costs is weakened compared to the 10 seat concept.
“The reason Boeing is doing this is to push more seats, and make its aircraft more competitive than our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Airbus’ head of passenger comfort for Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins with 10 seats in a row for existing 777 models are consistent with the fact that many passengers are for a denser layout that can go hand in hand with lower fees.
“A forty-five-centimeter-wide seat would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an Airbus business perspective, the design is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats, but offer airlines a catalog of suppliers to choose from.
The traveling aircraft vendors even carry a measuring band with them to check the competitive layout.
While prides itself on comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-density aircraft for low-cost companies and regional travelers.
Airbus offers the A350 with 10 seats in a row, but says it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus had emphasized the need for more cabin modifications by offering some of its aircraft wider seats in the aisles.
Experts say that without the support of a single other manufacturer of large modern aircraft, the call for new industry standards will remain unheard of, but may deter from the wave of sales of the 777X.
The number of people infected with HIV has exceeded a thousand in Prague
In the Czech Republic, the number of infections is increasing every year.
For example, in 2002 tests confirmed infection in 50 people, five years later there were 121 and in 2010 there were 180.
Last year, 212 people were infected and that was a record number.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200," said AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD>, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
According to him, from January to September last year there were 165 patients with HIV in the country, this year during the same period there were 176.
From the beginning of monitoring until the end of September this year, tests confirmed HIV in 1710 men and 353 women, with the most infected being in Prague.
Their number in September reached 1005.
There were 206 infected people living in the Central Bohemian Region.
The diagnosis was also heard by 156 people from the South Moravian region, 130 from Moravian-Silesian or 116 from <0xC3><0x9A>steck<0xC3><0xBD>.
The least infected are from the Highlands, there were 19 of them.
A total of 88 percent of patients were infected during sex.
Fourteen people have been infected with a blood transfusion in the past.
However, such a case has not appeared in the Czech Republic since the beginning of testing, i.e. in more than a quarter of a century.
Six children were also born with the HIV virus, transferred from their mother to them.
The nonsense in the movie Gravity is, but watching it is beautiful, experts say
A fantastic film from the universe Gravity sold out cinema in the Czech Republic some time after its premiere.
In October, according to the Union of Film Distributors, it was seen by almost 150,000 viewers and earned over 26 million crowns.
Most of the reviews evaluate the picture positively.
Others, however, find some inconsistencies in it.
The server Lidovky.cz asked experts from the ranks of astronomers and astrophysicists about how they liked the film and whether they noticed some nonsense that appeared in the film.
Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Du<0xC5><0xA1>ek (director of Hv<0xC4><0x9B>zd<0xC3><0xA1>rna a planet<0xC3><0xA1>ria Brno): I like science fiction films, which I consider to be modern, dreamy fairy tales.
The film does not exclude Gravity, even though it looks like a "physically real" performance.
He's not, but that doesn't mean he's bad.
I enjoyed it a lot.
You may notice, for example, the hair of Sandra Bullock, which somehow does not stand up in a state of weightlessness.
The Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station are moving along vastly different orbits, so they cannot be seen in a single image.
Some viewers of the film blame the unrealistic effect and in general the behavior of the fire in a state of uneasiness.
According to them, the cabinets would not withstand such blows either.
Heroes in the film Gravity often get into a collision with various objects and suits without much trouble everything will last.
The criticism was not spared even the plot.
Such an extensive tragedy on Earth’s orbit is, according to some commentators, unrealistic.
Plus, she wonders why the doctor was sent into space to fix the technique.
People in the forums also argue about the "unreal" behavior of the ropes.
It looks like it's meant for bungee jumping.
Marcel Gr<0xC3><0xBC>n (Director of the Starry and Planetary Society of Prague): I have only seen him on a wide screen so far, but I can clearly say that I was enchanted.
I'm glad it wasn't a documentary film, but science fiction.
And with such a story, the author has the right (almost the obligation) not to consistently stick to reality.
"More than the inconsistencies mentioned by you, I have been touched by how three times a space station with a degrading level of technology (the last time Chinese) is shown."
After all, China will be at the end of the decade and will probably look better than it is in the movie.
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Karas (Director of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): In computer-generated scenes, the authors are very successful in trying not to violate the physical laws, and so the scientifically oriented viewer appreciates that in various cosmic collisions and collisions, the polarity of the polarity is quite correctly observed in the atmosphere, the polarity of the polarity is quite the same.
Inconsistencies will certainly be found in a more detailed examination.
Additionally, when reading the comments, for example, I found that the preferred direction of circulation of various space debris on the orbit appears reversed in some scenes than it should actually be (from west to east).
Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n (an employee of the Astronomical Institute of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic): Some things the creators adapted to their needs, but I did not notice any fundamental and heavenly sin against logic or natural laws in the film, and compared to other films of similar focus, it is evident that some of the characters in the film are very different.
From moments that make no sense, it is worth mentioning the fact that the Hubble Space Telescope orbits in a different orbit than the ISS.
As a result, the speed is significantly different from each other, and rescue operations could not, in fact, take place as shown in the film.
Further, at the time of the separation of Kowalski (Clooney) and Stone (Bullock), I did not notice that the entire ISS was rotating, so there is not even a clear origin of the force acting on Kowalski, which forces both actors to let go at a moment when they are no longer moving towards each other.
A New Nicotine Vaccine May Remove the Pleasure of Smoking
Scientists have developed a vaccine against nicotine, which can take away the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine has been able to protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Before testing on humans, further tests are needed, which will take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell School of Medicine in New York says the first indications are good.
“We strongly hope that this kind of vaccination strategy can finally help the millions of smokers who have tried to quit and exhausted all the methods available on the market today, but have found that their nicotine addiction is so strong that it overcomes all current approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been engineered to carry genetic information to create anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects liver cells, which then begin to form a fluid flow of these antibodies.
Antibodies chase all of the nicotine molecules in the bloodstream and neutralize them before they get into the brain, preventing the smoker from getting a nicotine attack.
In the tests of vaccinated mice, which were additionally supplied with nicotine, they continued their normal activities.
But mice that weren’t vaccinated “calm down,” the researchers said, which is a sign that nicotine has gotten into their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
The previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The injections had to be given so often that sufficient levels of antibodies were maintained that they proved to be expensive and impractical.
The cost of the new vaccine should be much lower because it converts liver cells into antibody-producing factories.
Professor Crystal said that if future vaccines for humans are completely safe, they could be given to children before they have a taste for cigarettes, and thus avoid nicotine addiction.
However, it is more likely to be used by smokers to stop smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t enjoy the nicotine vaccine, and that will help them get rid of this habit,” he said.
British scientists said the results were interesting, but they point out that more research is needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
The former Labour minister of New South Wales (Australia) will be investigated by the State Committee on Corruption Supervision.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied that he would change a coastal lease policy at the request of his political adviser Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties on government-controlled land.
The Independent Anti-Corruption Committee (ICAC) expanded its search on Friday to see whether Mr. Obeid lobbied several state ministers to rent him out at Circular Quay, where Obeid owned two restaurants and a coffee shop, restored without having to file a lawsuit after it expired in August 2005.
The committee is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi knew of Mr. Obeid's secret interests in these properties, based on evidence submitted on Thursday by the former deputy head of Mr. Tripodi's office, Lynne Ashpole.
During the years of talks that began in 2005, the government pushed for rents to go to public competitions.
The tenants were against it and also wanted more long-term contractual terms.
In 2009, rentals for Circular Quay businesses, which brought Obeid $2.5 million a year, were renewed without the need to participate in a public competition.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally a supporter of public tenders.
He denied, however, that the changes were made at the request of Mr. Obeid, who, as Mr. Tripodi admitted, insisted on a shift in government rent policy.
The transcript of the calls presented at the ICAC showed calls from August to September 2007 between Mr. Obeid and Tripodim and Steve Dunn, a senior official who came to the port resort after working under Mr. Obeid in the fisheries department.
"Was the subject of conversations during these phone calls the development of commercial lease policy?" asked Assistant Commissioner Anthony Whealy of Mr. Tripodi.
'No, 'said Mr. Tripodi.
I can't remember what we were talking about, but definitely not this one.
Certainly not between me and Mr. Obey.
Israeli Air Force Attacks Target in Syria, Officials Say
Israeli military aircraft hit a target in the Syrian port of Lazikia on Thursday night, a senior administration official confirmed to Fox News.
This responsible official did not specifically say what the goal was, but said that there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice before this year, Israel carried out an airstrike on rocket supplies in Syria.
A lot of things have changed, and it’s different.
Perhaps the commentator Pe<0xC4><0x8D>inka spoke in such a way that it was possible to agree with it, while the President <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>ch was stirring up discord.
Heytman Chovanec was a suspect to me as soon as he was elected to the presidency, and he confirmed it.
President Sobotka has always been, and continues to be, a symbol of the misery of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The other gentlemen showed their weaknesses in the first place.
Senator Dienstbier is principled and legible and unusable, the vice-president of Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lek has become the most impossible interview on television.
On this basis, I see no better option than for the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD to propose to the Vice-President of the Senate Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> as Prime Minister, the only one that would not have an initial disability and I think that it would carry out a standard performance.
This is such a good solution that hardly anyone in the leadership will support it.
I add that this solution is the only way to forget what was being done and continue without tearing the party apart.
Alena Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1> could easily form a minority government with only a blessing from the president of Babi<0xC5><0xA1> and without the people, but with the people's Minister of Health Spoorka, who is actually a believing social democrat.
This mini-minority government would have great stability because it would enforce a proper referendum law, and President Okamura pledged to support this as well.
President Babi<0xC5><0xA1> would eventually come to terms with tax progress, because he is smart and he will see that it is not possible without it.
People wouldn’t bring problems, because the Caller is the bearer of the best they have, and they wouldn’t be in government otherwise.
The same is true of YES, a valuable minister would be found here, but if they do not want to enter a risky government participation, but provide support, well.
Let's give courage to Alena Gajd<0xC5><0xAF><0xC5><0xA1>kov<0xC3><0xA1>!
Foreign workers with a visa permit may be subject to the "authority" test
With the government’s intention to expand police operations, it is considering a “authority” test for foreign workers with a 457 visa.
The test, if accepted, will be applied through criteria to prevent the 457 program from being used to fill unskilled jobs, or as a back door for family and friends to move to Australia.
When a government discussion paper was published today, former Labour MP Maxine McKew condemned the government’s rhetoric about foreign workers in words that it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
“The loud statements of ‘foreigners at the end of the front line’ and ‘work first for Australians’ are a very unpleasant remnant of a time when unions were demanding a protected labour market,” she told the Australian-Indian Institute.
Historically, this meant that the white workforce should be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if anyone in this region had recorded the reverberation of this historic artifact.
The article discusses 12 measures that former immigration minister Chris Bowen had previously considered.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka yesterday, where he is working with officials to smuggle people, has implemented five of the recommended changes and the others remain to be considered.
If the eligibility criteria are adopted, visa applicants may be examined in detail as to whether "the nomination is eligible for a situation where the candidate is in a relationship or personal connection with the owner or relevant person of the sponsoring undertaking."
After previous experience with companies that intended to sponsor a small number of workers, but then employed hundreds of them, companies may also be required to justify the number of visa holders 457.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan man seeking asylum died on suspicion of having a heart attack after arriving this week on an asylum boat on Christmas Island.
The husband’s nine-year-old frightened son travelled to Australia with him and after his father’s death on Wednesday was comforted by an adult cousin who was also on board.
Australian authorities and a man rushed him to a Christmas Island hospital where he died.
The UK government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland.
HS2’s work suggests that high-speed services for Scotland and northern England will begin as soon as the first phase is launched in 2026.
The transport minister, Baroness Kramer, said the project would "bring Britain together".
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “excited” to work with the British government on the plan.
The first phase will consist of a new high-speed train line between London and the West Midlands.
After completing Phase Two, the line will lead from Manchester to Leeds.
In June, the government reassessed the estimated cost of building a high-speed line between London and northern England from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The British government, which has held talks with the national transport office Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 to find out more rail capacity and the possibility of improving travel times for northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of possible travel times from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London corresponding to three and less hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will better connect the UK and its cities.”
We gave SH2 green because the benefit it will bring is huge.
Without it, we face a crisis in the capacity of our rail network.
But it’s also about connectivity – HS2 will make it easier to connect 18 cities across the UK, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.
Scottish Minister Alistair Carmichael added: “Today’s announcement is good news for Scotland.”
Under the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr. Carmichael to "definitely" support Scottish integration into the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: “The high-speed rail has the potential to bring Scotland immense economic benefits, but it also adds to Scotland’s economic weight in the overall case of the high-speed rail across the UK.”
We are therefore delighted to be working with the British Government to explore the possibility of bringing a high-speed railway to Scotland to benefit everyone and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh line, which the Scottish Government is planning to do.
I look forward to reviewing the report on this study together with UK ministers over the next year and to jointly deciding on further steps.
Together with B<0xC3><0xA1>rta, the anti-corruption police inspector and analyst arrested
Information about the arrest of V<0xC3><0xAD>ta B<0xC3><0xA1>rta began to spread on Thursday evening, when the report was brought by the Prvn<0xC3><0xAD>zpravy.cz server.
MF DNES soon discovered that she had taken over the case from the General Inspectorate of the Security Corps (GIBS), her people were to arrest B<0xC3><0xA1>rta in the center of Prague.
It took place in front of the Four Seasons Hotel.
The Inspectorate deals with cases where they are among the accused police officers, but its jurisdiction also applies to civilians.
According to the MF DNES, one of the officers of the anti-corruption police - head of analysts and informatics Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek - is among the arrested.
He used to work for the Security Intelligence Service.
However, anti-corruption police spokesman Jaroslav Ibehej refused to comment on the information, saying that the media must turn to GIBS in this matter.
But Radka Sandorov<0xC3><0xA1>, her inspection spokesman, did not want to say anything about the case, so she sent a message to the Prague State Prosecutor’s Office.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," spokeswoman <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Zenklov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Also, from this inconclusive reaction, it can be inferred that the event took place, but it is in the mode of secrecy, which does not allow the speaker to say anything specific.
B<0xC3><0xA1>rt's lawyer, Old<0xC5><0x99>ich Poverty, is also in a similar situation.
He told the media that he represents Bart "in this matter too", but given that it is classified information, he cannot confirm or deny Bart's arrest.
Some media initially speculated that Bart's arrest may have been related to former police president Peter Lessy.
This was promoted to the position of B<0xC3><0xA1>rta together with former VV President Radek John, who was at the head of the Ministry of the Interior.
The dispute between the former Prime Minister Peter Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as and the VV had to be resolved even by the then President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus.
I don’t know where this connection came from for me.
No one contacted me, I wasn't interrogated.
"I really don't know anything about it," Lessy said.
In January 2011, Lessy became the police chief.
He was officially promoted by Radek John, the real head of the party, but it was Bart.
B<0xC3><0xA1>rta now ran for election for the Dawn movement, but his parliamentary mandate was narrowly missed by 175 votes.
Dawn leader Tomio Okamura said he had no idea what it was all about.
"V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta was one of the many candidates of many parties to our candidate and as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was not even a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomio Okamura," he distanced himself from B<0xC3><0xA1>rta Okamura, who said before the elections that he gave B<0xC3><0xA1>rta's place to the ex-candidate.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rta joined the court in 2012 with his former colleague Jaroslav <0xC5><0xA0>k<0xC3><0xA1>rka.
The rules on the use of electronic devices in aircraft will remain in force in Australia for the time being.
Passengers of Australian airlines will continue to have to switch off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing, regardless of changes in the U.S. in order to mitigate regulations regarding these devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has given U.S. companies space to change their practices so that passengers will be able to read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their devices during critical phases of flight if the devices remain in “flight” mode.
Passengers can already do this during most of the flight, but many people are annoyed that they cannot access their e-books during take-off and landing.
Australian carriers are looking into this decision, which requires a lot of work from U.S. carriers to meet these requirements, but have indicated that they do not plan to change their procedures anytime soon.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) also said it had examined the notification, but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices at critical flight stages are still in place in Australia.
"CASA currently does not have any specific regulations governing the use of electronic devices in aircraft," he said.
This issue is covered by regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and that passengers act in accordance with the safety instructions they receive from crew members.
Virgin, which has already spoken to CASA about expanding the use of its on-board entertainment wi-fi system, was in favour of the change, but announced that it would be subject to a regulatory authority decision.
“We would welcome CASA to conduct an analysis of the permission to use electronic devices, because we really think that now that we have (wireless on-board entertainment), it would improve the customer experience,” the spokesperson said.
Qantas has announced that it will comply with the current regulations for the time being.
“Our current policy is that electronic devices should not be used during take-off and landing, and we do not intend to change that anytime soon,” he said.
The FAA regulations apply to U.S. airlines.
However, we are constantly interested in developments in the regulatory area that can be useful for our passengers, and we certainly thoroughly study the FAA’s decisions and the reasons behind them.
In the case of U.S. carriers, the impact of the regulations will vary from company to company and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will have to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile phones, as well as review manuals, training materials, hand luggage programs and passenger information.
“Once an airline confirms its fleet tolerance, it can allow passengers to use portable and lightweight electronic devices, such as tablets, e-readers and smartphones, at any altitude,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off the equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under the seats or in a storage space above the head during take-off and descent.
With the growing misery of the middle class, Singapore’s pawnshops are experiencing a boom
At a pawnshop in Singapore’s Bendemeer shopping mall, Janani Amirthalinga stops by with a gold bracelet, ring and earrings to pay her daughter a tuition fee.
"My husband and I just bought a house and I put all my money into it," says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she receives $2,400 (3,000 SGD) each month as an administrator and her husband also works, her family’s monthly income is insufficient, she says.
The demand across areas in Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – is indeed such that ValueMax, where the woman is conducting her transaction, became the third-ranked pawnshop on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Stopping jewelry isn’t just a quick way to borrow cash – 1,300 SGD in the case of Mrs Amirthalinga – but it’s also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
Locksmiths in Singapore typically apply an annual percentage rate of 17 percent, just above the 15.4 percent rate offered by United Overseas Bank, a local bank with a branch in the same shopping mall.
Locksmiths, however, have the advantage that they do not require a person’s verification (payment history) or proof of income, and can provide a loan faster than banks.
And therefore, as families feel pressured by rising living costs and rising household debt and consumer debt, millions of people across the region turn to pawn shops.
After five years of massive growth from the global financial crisis and cheap loans backed by a relaxed monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families are turning to pawnshops to deal with the worsening financial situation.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited the increasing use of credit in households primarily due to rising rents as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
She said that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia in terms of gross domestic product.
Malaysia is at the top of the ranking with a ratio of 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists were also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which just got out of a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed continued weak exports and weakening consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising costs, people from middle to low [income] will try to supplement their income wherever they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at Malaysia’s CIMB bank.
Historically, high gold prices in the past two years have contributed to the fact that people are hesitant to stop their personal property and take the opportunity to exchange their family jewelry for cash.
About 70 percent of the items stopped in 200 city pawnshops make up gold.
People say the price of gold looks good, we'll stop Grandma's golden necklace and get it back next month.
Thailand’s largest pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in the number of customers using its pawnshop in recent months.
The growth in the pawnbroker industry is so great that ValueMax, the operator of the Bendemeer center and 15 similar branches in Singapore, plans to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where it has four branches – but also outside Asia, says ValueMax CEO Lee Ching.
The company will finance this by using 60 percent of the 66 million SGD it earned on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
While some discount lenders have come under fire for criticism over high interest rates, Ms. Yeah says the pledge offers not only lower rates than other lenders, but it also doesn’t directly raise debt.
“Customers stop items they already own, and monetizing personal property doesn’t increase household debt,” he says.
In the company, the pledge of assets is increasingly accepted as a means to ensure short-term, secure financing.
Moreover, among those who use pawnshops, it is not only people in financial distress.
Wealthy people from Singapore also use ValueMax branches when they stop gold bars or Rolex watches, so they can get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
Our customers are of all kinds.
“They include wealthy individuals who need to borrow in the short term because of their bold trades or investments, or small businesses who need help solving problems in their cash flow,” says Ms. Yeah.
Sometimes they just need the money as quickly as possible.
A $325 million rescue package for Tasmanian health care.
The federal government insists that the $325 million bailout package for dying health care in Tasmania contains harsh conditions that will ensure that the state government does not squander funds.
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that the Australian Union is taking "accelerated measures" to avert the crisis caused by the island's aging population, higher numbers of chronic diseases and systemic disorders.
Funding for four years was decided after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MP Andrew Wilk.
"The government has come up with an emergency rescue package that we believe will solve the specific problems the state is facing," Plibersek said.
The $325 million package includes $31 million per surgery at the request of the patient.
A further 2,600 surgeries, including orthopaedic surgery and cataract surgery, will help eliminate debt.
Money is also being made available at freely accessible clinics in Hobart and Launceston, improved post-operative care, training of health specialists, mental health services and the introduction of personal electronic health record systems in local hospitals.
“These investments are in response to the ideas that leading clinicians have told me will best help the Tasmanian healthcare system,” Plibersek said.
The minister stressed that the Tasmanian government must require a strict reporting and record-keeping regime.
The state will have to maintain the current level of funding in order to receive Australian Union money, and report monthly on where the additional funding has been spent.
A three-member committee will be set up to ensure that the state delivers services as efficiently as possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that $325 million would be useless “until genuine reform is followed in order to lay a more sustainable foundation for the Tasmanian public health system.”
Nevertheless, he praised the government for responding to his request for accelerated assistance, which he first raised during talks with the prime minister in early May.
"I believe that the federal aid package can get the public health system out of critical condition," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional elected procedures will significantly reverse the recent cuts.
Federal health opposition spokesman Peter Dutton believes today's statement is just a "trash".
“The reason I’m here is that the Labour government has withdrawn $430 million from our health care system,” he told ABC TV.
You can’t have a state government that takes away almost half a billion dollars, and an Australian Union that gives away $300 million, and pretend that’s good news.
Mr. Dutton urged Mrs. Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar from the bailout package would be spent on higher bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux has adapted the novel by Denise Diderot, which brings an exceptional film journey and portrayal of time, but is also more boring than it should be.
Set in the 1960s in France, it tells the grim story of Suzanne, a young noblewoman sent to the monastery by her family.
When she revolts, she experiences an extremely cruel treatment from a criminally depraved mother, and for another she becomes the object of sexual passion.
The film never slips to ugliness or sensationality, and that’s its problem.
The ceremonial character of this story leads to the fact that even the audience will experience the torment of wearing a knitted shirt.

Syria Has Destroyed Its Chemical Weapons Production Means, Supervisory Authority Says
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and poison gas munitions, the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Committee said on Thursday, as fierce conflicts erupted in the north of the country, near one of the places where poison gas is expected to be stored.
On Thursday, the Syrian activist group said more than 120,000 people had been killed since the start of the civil war nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons came the day before November 1,
the deadline set by that organization, based in The Hague, for the destruction or decommissioning of all chemical weapons production facilities and chemical mixing machinery for the purpose of producing poisonous gas and ammunition.
Completing this initial phase of destruction is a major milestone in an ambitious timeline that aims to destroy all of Damascus’ chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of equipment means that Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to start destroying existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including sarin and nerve gas.
The announcement came as fighting raged in the town of Safira, which experts speak of as the site of a chemical weapons factory and warehouses, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Thursday.
A group of activists, who monitored the total number of victims through a network of activists in Syria, announced on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 are expected to be civilians, including 6,365 children.
The government side will include 29,954 members of Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces, 18,678 pro-government fighters, and 187 Lebanese Hizballah fighters.
Among those killed were 2,202 government defectors and about 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
Since then, this number has not been updated.
The conflict has forced about 2 million people to leave the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting in Safir against insurgents, many of whom are linked to al-Qaeda, for weeks.
The observable on Thursday said the losses were on both sides, but had no specific numbers.
The fighting underscored the danger faced by chemical weapons inspectors who, in their mission to rid Syria of its chemical arsenal in the midst of the ongoing civil war, have to deal with tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which is working closely with the United Nations, said its team is now “satisfied that it has verified – and monitored the destruction – of Syria’s declared essential equipment for production and mixing/filling.”
He added that "no further control activities are currently planned".
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first round of verification work when they visited 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
The inspectors said they were unable to visit the two sites due to safety concerns.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites had been “abandoned and ... items of the chemical weapons program it contained were moved to two other declared sites that were checked.”
It was not immediately clear whether the facility in Safira was one of those places that OPCW inspectors could not visit.
Syria has agreed to a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPCW Executive Committee next month.
"I bow to the courage and bravery you have shown in fulfilling this most challenging mission this organization has ever had," observer director Ahmet Uzumcu said in a commentary issued by the OPCW.
Now, in its third year, the Sunni Muslim rebels and Assad’s government, with their security forces full of members of the Alawite sect, stand against each other in the civil war.
As for further developments, the head of the Observatory Rami Abdul Rahman said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion inside the air defense facilities in the Syrian coastal province of Lazikia.
He said the cause of the explosion was unknown.
Anger at the verdict of the founder of the Bali bombing
Survivors and relatives of 202 people killed in a 2002 Bali bombing reacted furiously to the verdict handed down on the last of the founders who were brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should be executed.
Patek, who spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of the most wanted people in Southeast Asia, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for building the explosive devices used in the bombing.
He could be paroled in 15 years.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder in an attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta that left 202 people dead, including 88 Australians, and many injured.
He was also found guilty on several other terrorism-related charges, including a series of bombings of churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve 2000.
The prosecution demanded a life sentence, though it may have required a man nicknamed "Demolition man" to receive the death penalty for his reputation as an explosives expert.
This decision revived the painful memories of June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny nearly ten years ago in a devastating attack launched by Patek and other founders.
With tears in her eyes, she said that Patek should be sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the others.
She told the AAP, "He should be put in front of the executioner's squad."
Every day I have to live with the fact that I will not see any more grandchildren and my daughters.
The Sari Club was compared to the country when a heavy load was fired shortly after 11 p.m. on 12 October 2002 from an outdoor parked van.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber fired a backpack filled with explosives.
As a result of the explosion, he fell into a coma for a month, and while he was kept alive, he "died" three times to doctors.
Mr Hughes said Patek should face the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jama Islamiya responsible for the massacre – Amrozi, Muchlas and Imam Samudru – who were executed four years ago.
This guy should get the death penalty like no one else.
To keep him alive... there's no reason to keep him alive.
To get 20 years for killing 202 people and injuring hundreds of others is not so much.
Patek was on trial as the last of the Bali bombers.
He avoided arrest for nearly a decade, but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where, less than four months later, U.S. forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.
During the trial, an FBI agent stated in his testimony that intelligence reports revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden in an effort to re-establish ties between terrorist groups from Southeast Asia and al-Qaeda.
"He didn't give up voluntarily," said Mrs. Corteen.
To this day, he has not felt regret for how much grief he has caused others.
The verdict comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack later this year, which will include ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
"We'll see a lot of tears this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek can still appeal the verdict.
FAA: Air passengers can now use technology on planes (but can’t call from their mobile phones)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices “from gate to gate” – except for calls from their mobile phones – to read, play games, watch movies and listen to music based on the eagerly awaited new rules issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on Thursday.
However, passengers should not expect changes to occur immediately.
How quickly the change will be implemented will vary according to individual airlines, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Airlines will need to demonstrate to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new rules and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and equipment storage guidelines to comply with the new rules.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
Among the companies that have already submitted plans are Delta and JetBlue.
"Depending on the status of such a plan, we can improve the widespread use of electronic devices very quickly," the FAA said in a statement.
At present, passengers are required to turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft door closes.
They cannot turn them on until the plane reaches a height of 3 kilometers and the captain issues a permit.
Passengers are expected to switch off their devices again when the plane drops to land, and not turn them on until the plane is on the ground.
Under the new rules, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference may allow their passengers to use their equipment during take-off, landing and take-off, the FAA said.
The majority of new transport aircraft and other aircraft, which have been adapted so that passengers can use Wifi at higher altitudes, are expected to meet these criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Stewards, welcomed the changes.
“Once the new rules are safely implemented – and we work closely with transport companies on this – it will be a success,” Glading said in a statement.
To be honest, we are tired of looking like “watchers.”
However, surfing the Internet, sending e-mails and text messages or downloading data below 3 kilometers above sea level will continue to be prohibited, the agency said.
Passengers will be notified to switch their smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no Words with friends, an online scrabble game played by actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011, when he was, as is well known, thrown out of an American Airlines plane because he refused to turn off his device when the plane was parked at the gate.
And heavier devices like laptops will have to continue to be stored because of concerns that they could hurt someone if they were flying around the cabin.
Calls from mobile phones will continue to be banned on board.
The rules for using mobile phones are not set by the FAA, but by the U.S. Federal Telecommunications Committee.
The FAA may cancel the ban on some electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the State Transportation Safety Committee, a national transportation safety expert at CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered a risk.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they can potentially create interference with navigation devices, but from the FCC’s data, we also know that they can cause interference in the air with broadcast towers,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA administration to investigate the issue last month proposed that the government allow wider use of electronic devices.
The FAA has been under pressure in recent years to ease restrictions on their use.
Critics such as Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat from Missouri, say there is no legitimate security reason for the ban.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce, as the use of such devices is ubiquitous.
Some studies suggest that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the obligation to turn off their devices.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by passengers in 1966 in response to disruptions to navigation and communication equipment when passengers began to carry FM radios, a technical feat of the era.
The new airlines are much more reliant on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA administration to be resistant to electronic interference.
For several years now, airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi at travel altitudes.
Plans adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airlines should adapt to greater use of electronic devices under the new rules, Huert said.
Today’s electronic devices generally emit far less intense radio transmissions than those of previous generations.
For example, e-readers only issue minimal broadcasts when turning the page.
But broadcasting is more powerful when devices download or send data.
Among those pushing to ease restrictions on the use of these devices by passengers is Amazon.com.
In 2011, representatives of the company loaded the transport aircraft with their Kindle e-readers and conducted a test flight, but no problems appeared.
The members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings as to whether these facilities posed any risks.
Douglas Kidd of the National Airline Passengers Association said he is convinced that interference from these devices is real, even if the risk is minimal.
Other members of the committee stated that there are only scrap reports from pilots to support the fact that such devices can cause disruption to aviation systems, and most of these reports are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to order passengers to switch off equipment during low-visibility flight.
The travel industry group welcomed these changes and said it was a reasonable procedure for the travelling public to make full use of the technology.
“We are pleased that the FAA has recognized that a pleasant travel experience is not at odds with safety,” said Roger Dow, executive director of the American Travel Association.
The bird was transported by air from a drilling rig in the North Sea and released back into the wild
The bird was transported to the coast after it was found exhausted on an oil platform in the Black Sea, and released back into the wild.
One was flown to Aberdeen by a helicopter last month after being treated by the Scottish company SPCA at a rescue centre until he was cured.
Operations Center Colin Seddon said: “This bush probably migrated from northern Europe when it was caught by a strong wind over the North Sea.”
He seems to have run out of strength and found refuge on the oil rig.
Mr Seddon added: “He was unable to take off again, so they contacted us with a request for help.”
By the time he was released, he was in good health.
Is the European elite ready to trade with the UK?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with a promise to connect businesses and define what changes in relation to the EU British entrepreneurs and job-creating companies want to see.
To this end, we conducted the largest and most comprehensive survey in which we asked the UK’s top business leaders about their views on Britain, trade and the EU.
YouGov surveyed 1,000 business leaders representing UK businesses of all sizes and from different sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will come as a surprise to many.
We have found that the overwhelming majority of businesses are now trying to export outside Europe and focus on countries that are modernising and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want to see the government preferring new trade ties with countries such as China, India and Brazil to embark on a long and arduous process of reforming mysterious European institutions.
When asked about their views on specific policy areas – from monopoly regulations to product laws – most entrepreneurs expressed the view that the control of these key competencies should be returned to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market and entrepreneurs said that the costs of Brussels regulations now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European business area – as much as 40 percent of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European companies, agreed.
And finally, our survey of leading companies revealed the most eloquent knowledge, namely that a clear majority wants Britain to seek to change the treaty and the relationship with the EU, which should be based on trade, not politics.
The findings, which have identified businesses of different sizes and major business groups, show that the business sector is pushing for a “meaningful change” that will transfer influence back to the UK.
There is a lot at stake – reaching a treaty change and a better deal for the UK could mean a gain of up to 16% when voting in a referendum for staying in the EU.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate: this survey shows that British trade supports his plan to amend the terms of British EU membership.
It also shows that the business sector expects this change to mean a significant shift from the current balance of power back towards the UK.
A better deal for Britain is possible, and as the euro area sets out on a path to a closer economic and fiscal union, it is even more necessary.
Jobs and growth in the UK must be a priority and, as the results of our survey show, for business it means a refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in Brussels’ regulatory approach.
John Kerry: Spying has gone too far!
The United States has sometimes gone “too far” in spying, according to the AFP, the head of US diplomacy John Kerry admitted during a video conference between Washington and London.
The gathering of information, according to the minister, served to deter terrorist attacks.
"The first admission from Washington" was echoed in the midst of a heated debate on both sides of the Atlantic over the US National Security Agency's (NSA) public surveillance scandal, which has also been targeted by U.S. allies.
"In some cases, I admit, as President Obama has done, some of these actions have gone too far and we are making sure that this will not happen in the future," Kerry said.
In the interview, however, he mainly defended the previous practice.
According to him, the collection of information is necessary to combat terrorism and prevent attacks, such as the attacks of 11 September 2001 in the United States, the attacks in Madrid in March 2004 or in London in July 2005.
“We prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding, and people from being killed because we were able to be informed of the intentions in time,” Kerry said.
However, he again admitted that the collection of information "in some cases went unreasonably far".
An affair involving U.S. intelligence, which allegedly tracked hundreds of millions of phone calls, broke out in Europe this month.
Among other things, it turned out that the Americans were also watching the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
European leaders did not hide their outrage and some of them called on the European Union to try to reach an agreement with the United States that would prevent or significantly limit surveillance.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom says the pipeline in Bulgaria is starting a new gas era
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria means the launch of one of the largest European energy projects, the director of Gazprom said.
“Today, we are witnessing the start of construction on the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe,” Gazprom President Alexei Miller said in a statement.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
The South Stream pipeline should add diversity to Russian export routes across Europe.
The contractual dispute between Gazprom and its partners in Ukraine, which brings most of Russia’s gas to Europe, adds to the risk of conventional routes, officials say.
Miller says a direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “always” removed.
Once the entire project starts operating in 2015, Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from the South Stream gas pipeline at a discounted price.
Gazprom says construction is set to begin in other countries towards the end of this year.
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 2.2 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.
Hizballah has sent thousands of fighters to Syria.
A decisive battle awaits.
Lebanon's Hizballah movement has deployed 15,000 of its fighters north of Damascus in preparation for a decisive battle over the mountainous Kalam<0xC3><0xBA>n region.
According to the ever-expanding reports, in Wednesday’s attacks on two sites in western Syria, Israel destroyed rockets designed specifically for Hizballah.
This Lebanese Shiite organization is fighting in Syria on the side of the army there.
Its program is also to fight against Israel, which does not interfere in the Syrian conflict, but has made it clear that it will prevent the transfer of arms to the hands of Hezbollah in Lebanon.
Reports of Wednesday’s Israeli airstrikes on weapons depots in western Syria are yet to be confirmed.
Israel did not comment on the attack, but U.S. sources confirmed it.
According to the Syrian website Dampress.com, rockets fired from the Mediterranean area hit the Syrian missile base Sn<0xC3><0xBA>bar Jabla south of Latakia.
The al-Arabiya news station said two warehouses were hit, where the rockets were ready to be transported to Lebanon.
According to its sources, these were Russian-made SA-8 missiles.
Israel declined to comment on the report, but military analyst Ron ben Yishai said Syria is constantly trying to supply Hezbollah with missiles and the Syrian Air Force is teaching members of the armed Hezbollah section how to deal with missiles.
The SA-8s are obsolete missiles that the Syrian army has had since the 1980s.
They are placed on a mobile chassis.
Although they are quite primitive, thanks to mobility and small dimensions it is easy to hide them.
They are equipped with a radar, which turns off after firing the missile, so it is difficult to target them.
Latakia is located in western Syria, in an area inhabited by the ruling Alavits.
It is a well-guarded area and Hezbollah has participated in the fighting in western Syria in the past.
He claims to be helping to protect the Syrian Shiite community to which the Alawites belong.
Now 15,000 of its fighters are reportedly ready to help the army recapture Kalam<0xC3><0xBA>n.
Along with Hezbollah, the Syrian army is also strengthening its forces there.
Kalam<0xC3><0xBA>n lies between Damascus and the third largest city in the country, Homs.
According to al-Arabiya, the battle is intended to be a response to the opposition’s recent attack on the headquarters of the Syrian Shiite brigade of Abu Fadl Abbas in the Shiite part of Damascus.
Hizballah helped the Syrian army fight back against the city of Kusair on the Lebanese border this year.
Many of the Kusair rebels have just left for Kalam<0xC3><0xBA>n.
Until recently, it seemed that the majority of citizens in the Czech Republic wanted early elections.
Corruption, squandering of money for overbought purchases and government contracts, tax increases and, last but not least, government scandals were cited as reasons.
According to the results of the elections, it can be inferred that the majority of citizens satisfied this condition.
That they didn’t mind, and with the state that was here (the theft and indebtedness of this state), they were actually satisfied.
Otherwise, I cannot explain that 3,413,497 voters did not make it to the elections, 596,357 voters voted TOP 09 384,174 voters voted ODS in total, so 4,394,028 actually supported the original government coalition, which represents 52.16% of all eligible voters.
That's a majority of the upper half.
When 1,016,829 <0xC4><0x8C>SSD voters were added to the above-mentioned parties, then with the old order (because all the mentioned parties were involved in the "stealing" and indebtedness of this state), then 64.23% of eligible voters actually agreed with this state.
In fact, most voters have made it clear that they are not robbing and overburdening this state to punish those responsible.
Or do you think that the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD members who took part in it will be subject to the appropriate laws?
Is there anything we can do to help?

The Royal Commission has learned that two members of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) have been charged in the case against Jonathan Lord.
The Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse learned that before charges were brought against child educator Jonathan Lord of Caringbah City in 2011, two staff members of the Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) in New South Wales were charged with sex offenses.
But before the commission it was said that in its opening statement to the commission, the association stated that they had never dealt with a case of sexual abuse of a child in their organization.
Executive Director Phillip Hare was questioned on a case when one of YMCA employees was charged with child pornography offences, and on another when a Caringbah gymnast from YMCA was convicted in 1991 of sexually harassing children he had in his care.
Mr Hare told Gaili Furness, an adviser to the commission, that he knew about the first case, but not the second.
He admitted that YMCA’s opening statement was also inaccurate when it stated that YMCA was conducting external audits that rated YMCA as a leading advocate for children’s rights.
The evidence presented by the commission suggests that YMCA was alerted to the fact that it received the second lowest of four possible ratings in an audit by the Ministry of Education and Society in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working with the YMCA when he was 21, admitted that his leadership had failed down the line by itself when he accepted Mr. Lord without making sure staff were aware of their obligation to report violations of child safety rules.
Earlier this year, Lord was convicted of sexually molesting 12 boys, which he committed during his two years at YMCA.
He was imprisoned for at least six years.
Mr Hare, however, rejected the claim that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting a child safety breach by Mr Lord.
Staff members provided evidence that they witnessed such violations, including Lord being alone with the children, keeping them private, letting them sit on his lap, telling them he liked them, and letting them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was Lord’s subordinate and asked for child safety training because she was concerned about his behavior, testified that Jacqui Barnat, head of child services at the YMCA in Caringbah, who was Lord’s superior, was “very intimidating and often very intimidating.”
The Director-General said he does not accept evidence from staff that they felt uninformed about contacting their superiors and reporting their actions.
Instead, he said that their friendship with the Lord obscured their judgment, and so they did not report the problem.
Mr Hare said he had told the New South Wales YMCA board that the lesson from the “Jonathan Lord case” for the organization was that the staff “didn’t report it,” and the board agreed.
Mr Hare said the decision to let staff sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the charges surfaced was made by YMCA General Manager for Child Services Liam Whitley.
He said the goal was to avoid breaking the evidence, but it was "overly zealous" and misguided.
Professor Stephen Smallbone, a child sexual abuse expert at Griffith University, told the commission that the YMCA in New South Wales was not a child-safe organization between 2009 and 2011.
He said there were serious problems in recruiting, vetting, hiring, training and managing staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair said he would take the chance to return to the post of Prime Minister, but admitted that the return is unlikely.
In an evening interview on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old politician expressed his views on various areas of domestic policy.
Since June 2007, when he stepped down after ten years in the leading position, Mr. Blair has mostly avoided talks about British politics and limited his comments to foreign affairs and his role as ambassador of the Middle East Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would return to the post of Prime Minister, his answer from London’s Evening Standard was, “Yes, of course, but it’s probably hard to get that, so...”
While crowds of horse show experts gathered in Cardiff to fight for the Horse of the Year award, it was clear to everyone that the competition would not be easy.
But no one was ready for three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
Although he is not yet in school and only a few months ago he took the first steps, this boy and his pet pet, the Shetland pony Toffee, smoothly slipped three laps to finally win the main prize and leave behind 30 trailing adult rivals.
This inseparable couple – with the same height – was praised for their appearance, behaviour and style at the annual competition run by the Sunnybank riding centre in the village of Rudry near Cardiff.
He stood up to the gentlemen and ladies in elegant hats, tilted his beret into a cheerful angle, and let his two-year-old Toffee walk the circuit.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural ability to control horses that far exceed his age.
And Toffee earned the highest marks for insight and personality.
Fenton Toffee got it in March for his third birthday and has been practicing daily with this Shetland pony ever since.
His mother Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and Toffee are working well together.”
They didn't have much hope, but eventually they left with a golden cup and a bouquet.
It was only the second time he had competed with Toffee, and when he won, we were thrilled.
Everyone considered him a phenomenal and completely foreign people wanted to take a picture with him.
A boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale in South Wales follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been showcasing horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs Howells says: “There was an exciting atmosphere and everyone was cheering and cheering.”
He ran on the sand all the way through the arena, and even though he was so small, he gave a great performance.
Fenton is obsessed with animals – he loves horses, tractors and a farm and has been given two chickens to take care of.
Given how he started, he'll be back in the Horse of the Year competition soon and I'm sure he'll be doing well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show competition said: “The Fentons are only three, but they already know how to control a pony.”
They make a great team together.
The jury picked up Fenton and Toffee for their excellent performance and for the way they performed on the circuit.
They always watch how good the team work is between the pony and the one who runs it – and Fenton and Toffe were the best on the oval.
I'm sure Fenton was helped by the lovely clothes he really fit in with him.
Overly Inquisitive Newspapers to Investigate
The Chinese newspaper, which on the front page requested the release of the reporter accused of defamation, will be thoroughly investigated, the press administrator said.
Guangzhou-based New Express newspaper has made a rare public request for Chen Yongzhou's release.
However, Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he took bribes to come up with stories about a partially state-owned company.
The administrator said that the New Express newspaper will now carry out a “full correction”.
The “correction” order came from the State Administration for Press and Publication, Radio, Film and Television in Kuang-tung Province.
Preliminary investigations have shown that between September 2012 and August 2013, the New Express newspaper of the Evening News group in Yangcheng issued several false reports about Zoomlion.
"The editorial board of the New Express newspaper was disorderly," he said in a statement to the administrator.
He said he had to decide "to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou in the form of the revocation of the journalist's license".
He also “ordered the Yangtze Evening News Group to conduct a comprehensive overhaul of the New Express newspaper, and recommended that they investigate the relevant New Express officials and immediately change the management of the New Express newspaper.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for New Express about financial irregularities in a company with construction equipment called Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, his newspapers issued two requests for his release on the front page and claimed he was behind his journalistic work.
Mr. Chen then appeared on state television and admitted that he had given false stories for a bribe.
"In this case, I have caused harm to Zoomlion and to the entire media industry and its ability to gain public trust," he told state news station CCTV.
I did it mainly because I craved money and fame.
I realize I've been acting wrong.
After questioning Mr Chen, he issued an apology on the front page of New Express stating that he had failed to carry out sufficient checks on his reports.
Recently, a number of sharply watched suspects have made a confession on television.
Experts say that confessions are still regularly enforced, regardless of this year’s amendment to the law, which prohibits authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
A tunnel has been found for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated drug-smuggling tunnels between the U.S. and Mexico has emerged, complete with its own lighting, ventilation and electric railway.
U.S. officials have described the roughly one-by-one-meter tunnel as one of the most ingenious secret passageways they have ever discovered.
The tunnel, which spans nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana in Mexico and San Diego in the United States.
This area is full of indefinite warehouses where it is easy to hide trucks before they are loaded with drugs.
Authorities said the tunnel was closed before drugs could be undetected in it.
Along with the discovery of the tunnel, authorities also detained eight and a half tons of marijuana and about 150 kilograms of cocaine, according to court records.
The three men, who are said to have worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine in order to distribute them.
In the case of conviction, he faces imprisonment from 10 years to life.
In the city of Nogales, Arizona, smugglers break into vast drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth largest tunnel discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October after a marijuana harvest in central Mexico, which poses a problem in front of drug cartels as to how to get their product to consumers as quickly as possible.
In 2010, authorities found a corridor about 650 meters long equipped with rails that led from the kitchen of one house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego.
The economy and the Centre connect management.
For example, they offer joint advertising.
New integrated newsroom of Economia in Prague, Karl<0xC3><0xAD>n.
Economia has taken the next step to transform the Centrum holding company into its media house.
Since Friday, the Economy and the Center have a joint top management.
"The unification of the organizational structure and the personnel union are essential for the integration of both publishing houses into a common media house," commented Kamil <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k, Deputy Chairman of the Board of the Economy and the Managing Director.
<0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>ka, who will be at the head of the unified management, will be complemented by Andreas Demuth, CEO of Centrum Holdings.
Pavel Vopa<0xC5><0x99>il was appointed the new joint director of the business, and Zuzana Tyl<0xC4><0x8D>erov<0xC3><0xA1>, the advertising director of both companies, is also subordinate to him.
<0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>n Burda became the new head of information technology.
Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r Pisk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek is the joint managing director of the editorial board, and Jakub Unger is the director of the transformation team.
The newly established position of Director of Marketing was entrusted to Adéla Pitts.
V<0xC4><0x9B>ra Lhotsk<0xC3><0xA1> is the new manager of a separate corporate communication department.
The joint financial director is Karel <0xC5><0xBD>alud, human resources management for both publishing houses is led by Petra Slab<0xC3><0xA1>.
"The new organizational structure will, among other things, allow us to enter the market with a joint offer of advertising products, better connect the creation of the content of all issued titles and, last but not least, significantly improve the company's business management," added <0xC4><0x8C>erm<0xC3><0xA1>k.
Economia, which is owned by financier Zden<0xC4><0x9B>k Bakala, signed a contract to buy Centrum Holdings and its Czech subsidiaries at the end of April this year.
Portfolio Centrum Holdings consists of servers Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz, <0xC5><0xBD>ena.cz, web portals, extensive e-mail base under the brands Centrum.cz and Atlas.cz and SMB agency Najisto or portfolio of almost two dozen other smaller websites.
The company Economia is the publisher of Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny, the news server IHNED.cz, weekly magazines Respect and Economist and a number of printed and online B2B titles.
Among Czech publishers, he has long been the most successful in selling digital versions of his major titles.
In June this year, the publishing house moved to newly built modern spaces in Prague’s Karl<0xC3><0xAD>n.
CME targets the television business.
It will leave almost a quarter of the population.
The media group CME will be released.
By the end of the year, he wants to slim down by a thousand people.
Osekat intends all side activities and wants to focus only on his main business, television broadcasting.
The group, which owns Nova TV in the Czech Republic and also operates in Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia, employs a total of about 4,500 people.
Almost a quarter of people lose their jobs.
The media group operates television in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Slovenia.
Part of the CME is the company CET 21, which holds licenses for broadcasting TV stations Nova, Nova Cinema, Nova Sport, Fanda, Sm<0xC3><0xAD>chov, Telka and Czech versions of the music station MTV.
How much the savings will affect the Czech Republic, where the group employs about 650 people, and what this will mean for the domestic TV station TV Nova, is not yet clear.
"It's premature and we can't really comment on it," said Nova Josef Koukol<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, director of communications.
According to MF DNES, a significant release of the Czech Republic will certainly not be avoided, but by far the biggest impact this should have on the staffing of CME branches in Romania and other countries.
The two new chief executives of Nova Christoph Mainusch and Michael Del Nin, who stepped in after longtime director Adrian Sarbu, said during a conference call with analysts on Wednesday that they want to limit all activities that are not directly related to the television business.
It is therefore quite likely that it will significantly reduce, in particular, the cost of producing its own shows, filmmaking and production activities.
<0xC4><0x8C>KD industrial complex in Prague burned a cooling tower at night
In the industrial area of <0xC4><0x8C>KD in Prague, a large-capacity tank was burning, according to firefighters, apparently a cooling tower.
"Firefighters went to the fire on Thursday before eleven o'clock in the evening, this morning they extinguished the fire," Prague Fire Department spokesman Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na Adamcov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The amount of harmful substances in the surrounding air, as measured, did not exceed the permitted limits.
The extent of the damage and causes of the fire are not yet known.
About five dozen firefighters gradually arrived at the Kolben Street compound.
"It's a large-capacity fuel tank fire, probably a cooling tower," Adamc said.
"There is no functional hydrant network in the area, so we fire using the transport line from the tankers," she added.
According to the server tn.cz, the fire was complicated by the malfunctioning network of hydrants, so the firefighters had to transport water from elsewhere.
The commander of the fire department announced the second stage of the fire alarm.
There are four stages in total, the fourth is declared in the most serious situations.
Chemists also went to the site to check the level of hazardous substances that could get into the air during the fire.
"But they did not target the amount of pollutants in the air that would exceed hygiene standards," a spokesman for the fire department said.
British police have given Assange a release notice.
British police today handed over a release notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who found refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London, where he applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had given the 40-year-old Australian “notice of extradition” by asking him to go to the police station and that if he did not, he could face arrest.
Assange has exhausted his options under British law when the Supreme Court this month overturned his appeal against extradition, facing extradition to Sweden on charges of sex crimes.
Fearing that Stockholm would take him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on June 19, where he had applied for asylum in the South American country.
Scotland Yard “delivered a release notice to a 40-year-old man asking to arrive at the police station on the day and hour assigned to him,” the spokesman said.
Assange continues to violate bail conditions.
The embassy declined to comment on the delivery of the release notice.
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States, where he may face espionage charges because he has published 250,000 U.S. diplomatic documents on the WikiLeaks website.

The driver was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving up to 210 km/h with a hot drink placed between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted on May 27 in his Mercedes Benz on the A120 in Braintree.
When the police stopped him, they found that he had a glass of drink between his thighs.
At the Colchester Police Court, Howie pleaded guilty to driving recklessly and inattentively.
Seven points were added to his account, resulting in a six-month ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay the costs of <0xC2><0xA3>90 and an allowance for the accused <0xC2><0xA3>100.
As a result of the tax on foreign property owners, the London bubble bursts
The Ministry of Finance has preliminarily quantified the tax on the return of financial assets, but is awaiting the final decision of Mr. Osborn, who in the 2012 budget introduced a 7% fee for the transfer of real estate for buildings at a price above <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and annual fees for buyers who own properties within the company, not as single.
Income from the transfer of real estate in the housing fund in Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea districts, which in the 2012/13 tax year reached <0xC2><0xA3>708 million, already exceeds the total for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, the North West and Yorkshire and Humber combined.
Mr Cook said: “Given the increase in the transfer of real estate in high-value homes and the introduction of related legislation to prevent tax avoidance, it is very difficult to argue that high-value property is taxed little regardless of the effect of the outdated head tax system.”
He added that “this move could have caused some foreign investors to be reluctant to buy properties in London, or to be reluctant to sell existing owners.”
Leading properties – the top 5% to 10% of the housing market by price – in the rich belt stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon saw a record 11.8% increase last year.
Prices in central London continue to show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6%, but have been overshadowed by a booming “domestic market” in which, according to a survey by real estate firm Savills, South West, North (7.4%) and East (6.5%) experienced growth.
Scientists have shed more light on how tail movements are related to a dog’s mood
Previous research has shown that happy dogs spin their tails more to the right (from a dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs have their tails mostly to the left.
Now, however, scientists say that other dogs are able to detect and respond to these subtle differences in tail movement.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neurobiologist at the University of Trent, said: “People are well aware that the left and right sides of the brain have different attachments to stimuli that arouse positive or negative emotions.”
We tried to see the same thing in other species.
He added that just as it is in humans, the right side of the brain is responsible for left-handed movements, and vice versa, and that these two hemispheres play a different role in emotions.
In an effort to gain more information about how dogs respond to other dogs’ uneven tails, researchers monitored animals that watched videos of other dogs.
They measured the pulse rate of these animals and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won’t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side, and sometimes to the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: “We have screened dog videos – either in the natural version or in the form of silhouettes – to get rid of any confusing stimuli, and we have also been able to adjust the movement of the tail and show it more to the right or left.”
When the animals saw an otherwise inconspicuous dog moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of a dog whirling its tail), they remained completely calm.
But when she recorded the tail shooting mostly to the left (again from the point of view of a dog whirling its tail), their pulse rate increased and the animals seemed insecure.
Professor Vallortigara said he doesn’t think dogs would consciously communicate with each other through these movements.
Rather, he believes that dogs have learned from experience what movements they must and do not have to pay attention to.
He said: “If you meet dogs several times and move their tails in one direction is repeatedly associated with rather friendly behavior and the movement of the traffic produces less friendly behavior, you will react on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say the findings may help dog owners, veterinarians, and exercisers better understand the emotions of their animals.
Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a university professor of veterinary medicine at the University of Bristol, said it was not the first study to examine whether the left and right sides were important to dogs.
Last year, a team from Lincoln University found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they observe an aggressive dog, and to the right when they look at a cheerful dog.
And in another expert paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: “Dogs were more likely to get to know a dog robot when it swung its tail to the left than to the right, when they became more insecure – the exact opposite of the Italian study.”
According to him, the difference can be made by the fact that dogs in these different animal studies in movies or dog robots did not behave completely like dogs.
He explained that it could help studies on how dogs respond to real dogs.
“Although there is good evidence in many different mammals that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
But given how simple it is to record their behavior, it probably won’t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes to one side and sometimes to the other.
Arctic Monkeys postponed concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
Rock band Arctic Monkeys moved to Glasgow after the lead singer was diagnosed with laryngeal inflammation.
The Sheffield group was scheduled to perform at the Hydro City Complex on Friday.
The illness of lead singer Alex Turner forced her to postpone the performance.
The group's announcement came after it was similarly forced to postpone Thursday's performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham.
In a statement on its official website, Arctic Monkeys said: “Following the decision to postpone today’s performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham and following a medical recommendation, Arctic Monkeys must also postpone the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow scheduled for Friday 1 November.”
"Alexi Turner has been diagnosed with laryngeal inflammation and unfortunately will not be able to get out."
The performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on 20 November and the performance at the Hydro complex in Glasgow on 21 November.

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February
The Vatican announced on Thursday that Pope Francis is appointing new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22.
Cardinals hold the highest position in the clergy of the Catholic Church immediately after the pope and are those who elect the pope, so Francis will establish his first group of men who will eventually help choose his successors.
There are now 201 cardinals.
However, once the cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of the pope – the group is reduced to 120 cardinals.
In a statement announcing the report, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of current cardinals known as the Consistory would be held before the solemn promotion of the new cardinals.
“Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance to facilitate the planning of other assemblies that require the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of electors is likely to drop by February.
He said that the pope usually appoints as many cardinals as it takes for the number of electors to rise again to 120, and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
The Consistory next year will be significant because it will be the first since Francis was elected in March of this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a certain orientation towards Europe Europe and, above all, Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope nominates cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he said.
Forty percent of Roman Catholics are in South America, but they have only a small number of cardinals.
It will also be the first election of cardinals since Francis established the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything for himself.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him," Valero said.
He said it was "quite possible" that the pope would ask for advice from these cardinals.
We haven’t been in this situation before – it’s completely new.
Valero said the popes have traditionally promoted bishops from large places to cardinals, but Francis is “full of surprise – so we don’t know who he’s naming.”
GM is recalling some new light trucks in the U.S. for seat back repairs
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its new (2014) Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra light trucks to correct the malfunction with the manual tilting of the backrest, according to a U.S. automotive safety authority announcement on Friday.
For some of these vehicles, the tilting mechanism of the front seats may have a malfunction.
As a result, seat backrests do not comply with federal automotive safety standards for head restraints.
A notice posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) website says that “if the car is hit from behind, the head restraint may not properly protect the passenger, which increases the risk of an accident.”
Downloaded models were made between August 1 and September 10.
GM put the car on the market in June, and this leading American carmaker is the most important launch vehicle since the restructuring after the bankruptcy in 2009.
GM informed the owners of the delivery of the fault in the first half of October.
NHTSA was unable to review the announcements to owners due to a 16-day government shutdown that weakened growth in car sales in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra, which were reworked for 2014 models, rose to about 20 percent in the first 10 months of this year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverados and 16,503 Sierras.
Shares on the New York Stock Exchange rose 1.4 percent to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The Desperate Scream of Obama’s Voters
I voted for Obama twice – I shared the hope for a possible change.
He says Obama’s sincere efforts have stifled the Republican Party’s obstruction
Obstructive policies can’t excuse the passion of Obama’s health care website or drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memoir is a sad reminder of what could have happened.
Nathaniel P. Morris studied medicine at Harvard for the second year.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
About this book, I thought that during the gloomy days of my second year in medical school, it would encourage me and restore a bit of hope in me.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and it’s a reminder of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finish patient reviews in the evening and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches took your breath away.
The elections ended in a landslide and television news forced us to reflect on the historical value of this moment.
My classmates were crying with joy, and my parents were hiding the papers they got.
A young team of visionaries headed for the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama was sworn in in 2008, he had 82 percent support.
And I'm closing the book here.
Going into the present is a harsh awakening, like waking up from a dream.
It’s hard to remember these optimistic days – they seem to be distant memories, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I cast my first ballot, there have really been changes.
It was definitely none of what I imagined.
I recognize that Obama has achieved a number of great and varied successes – from the Affordable Care Act to the removal of our troops from Iraq and the end of the policy of “nothing to ask, nothing to say” after the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
Moreover, I am convinced that the party obstructions have reversed so many efforts to move our nation forward: among others, it is immigration reform, the public's choice of health care and the closure of the Guantanamo base.
But after many situations where I defended the Obama administration in front of colleagues and friends, I have reached an absolute limit in terms of the explanations they can provide.
I found myself in a place of political despair.
The Republicans’ obstructions cannot explain their agreement to eavesdrop on foreign leaders or to drone strikes that kill innocent children overseas.
They can’t explain that the National Security Agency is collecting data on Americans’ private lives, or that it’s persecuting those who expose government misconduct.
They cannot be held responsible for the execution of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without due process, or for restricting public contributions and spending during presidential campaigns.
They cannot justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are “the most aggressive ... than the Nixon administration.”
And most recently, they can’t even excuse the inability to create a simple website more than 3 years after signing the Affordable Care Act.
I don't know if that was expected.
Did I have any idea at the age of 18 that government might be at odds with the political campaigns that preceded it?
The elected function obviously does not have a predictable course and our public talks will be formed by the opposition political party and random events such as the Newton Massacre.
However, all the examples I have mentioned above seem to be largely the result of the administration's own decision.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and untapped alternative and seemed unable to consolidate his politics or position.
I felt that the second term of office for Obama, freed from the pressure of the next election, would be filled with the hopes that we had heard about before.
Yet the return to 2008 – with Obama’s support dropping below 45% this week – is becoming increasingly difficult through this book.
It forces me to remember the number of promises that have been lost.
This week, I read a chapter in the book about how Obama suffered a crushing defeat with Clinton at the Pennsylvania primaries.
At an additional meeting during the campaign, he told his staff that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their mission.
"I want our magic back," he said.
We must not forget who we are.
It's been five years, Mr. President, and I totally agree with you.
The ideas expressed in this commentary are solely the views of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer Says Prime Minister Tony Abbott Is in Conflict of Interest Over Parental Leave Program
Billionaire and lawmaker Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is at odds over a parental leave program because his daughters can get pregnant and benefit from it.
The Bane magnate, who is waging a dispute over a $6 million coal tax payment, made the claim as he tried to shake the table as to whether it was in conflict of interest.
Palmer's United Party can control up to four votes in the Senate, which play a crucial role in deciding whether to levy taxes on coal and mining activities.
But Mr. Palmer argued that only ministers could be in conflict of interest, adding that Abbott's daughters were in a position to benefit personally from the policy.
“He got into a big conflict of interest when it came to paid parental leave, because if any of his daughters got pregnant, he would have a direct interest in whether she would get parental leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr. Palmer the winner in the battle for the seat for Fairfax County in the Sunshine Coast region thanks to a gain of 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the election results to speed up the process.
Daughters of Tony Abbott Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the closing of the polling stations?
"We have to have a better system," he said.
Why can’t we have a system where you can come, tap the details into your computer, instantly vote, and have the results at half past midnight?
Mr Palmer also criticized the use of pencils to mark ballots.
Is it that the results can be rubberized if someone does not like it?
These days and at this time, the use of pencils seems incredible.
The Electoral Commission studied the possibilities of electronic voting and recently issued a joint contribution to the debate with New Zealand.
Mr Palmer, 59, said his political agenda also applies to airports in the Sunshine Coast region and that he would take his new job “very seriously.”
Public office is a public service.
“We are not seeking any reward other than to be able to serve society at this critical time,” he said.
You wash your hands?
Scientists have found that washing your hands will change your mood as well.
The experiment involved 98 people, divided into three groups.
The first two were tasked with solving the unsolvable task.
Of course, they both failed.
But the group that washed their hands after the failure had a much more optimistic impression than the group where its participants had not washed their hands.
Also, the group "with washed hands" performed better in the next test than the other.
However, those who washed their hands achieved worse results in other tests than those who did not wash their hands.
The results of the "washed" were at the level of the third group, the participants of which did not notice any previous failures.
According to psychologists, the results of the test show that physical cleanliness removes really negative feelings after failure.
At the same time, however, the motivation decreases, the testers have to concentrate much more in the next tests.
If we were to transfer the results of the research to the Czech Republic, we would probably be the most optimistic after returning from the toilet.
After using the toilet, not only one percent of Czechs and Czechs have their hands, but on the way by public transport it is already one-fifth.
They usually stick to hygiene even after working in the garden or in the workshop, where 85 percent of people wash their hands.
78.7 percent of people are motivated to wash their hands when petting.
Recent research has revealed that there is a difference in the perception of Czechs and Slovaks, how much it is necessary to wash their hands after giving a hand to a stranger.
In this situation, 28.8% of Czechs and 40.3% of Slovaks will wash their hands.
Research has shown that both nations wash their hands about ten times a day.
"Although it would be on the spot, I'm afraid the reality is different and people are trying to make themselves a little better," commented skin doctor Klaudie Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rkov<0xC3><0xA1>.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
According to two people familiar with the situation, the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is suspending two traders in its foreign exchange division, another indication that a global investigation by regulators into suspected currency market manipulation is increasing in frequency.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are working with the competent authorities on investigations into the world’s largest financial market, where every day the owners change $5.3 trillion.
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended as part of an expanding investigation in response to the LIBOR (London Interbank Interest Rate) manipulation scandal.
The bank declined to comment on the suspension, but confirmed that it had received a request for information from the authorities this month.
“Our ongoing investigation into the matter continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other authorities,” the bank said in a statement.
Last month, people close to the event said RBS had handed over records of emails and quick messages sent from accounts and to accounts of a former trader to the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and is assumed to have been relieved of his current position as European Chairman of Foreign Exchange Trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European president of Citi’s cash trading business, took a holiday this week, while Matt Gardiner, the former head of barclays and UBS’ currency trading, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any offence.
Mr Usher’s group for sending quick messages included bankers from Barclays and Citigroup, people dedicated to the event said.
UBS said this week that after the Swiss supervisory authority Finma announced that it was investigating suspected currency manipulation in several Swiss banks, it had taken action against some of its employees.
Globally, at least six offices – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss antitrust office Weko, the FCA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Office – are investigating allegations that these bankers have conspired to move with the currency market.
In addition, people familiar with the situation said that HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse had launched an internal investigation or had received a request for information from the competent authorities.
Banks are combing through years-old quick messages and e-mails to find cases of wrongdoing.
Reports of investigations have alarmed traders in an area that has been one of the biggest engines for making profits at investment bank closings in recent years, but which has been disrupted by a small currency volatility limiting opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to reduce the severity of the situation by claiming that with a large and highly liquid foreign exchange market it is essentially impossible to manipulate, but high-ranking traders say that this may not necessarily be true.
The high-ranking trader said that despite the significant volume of day trading with foreign currency testing liquidity between different trading platforms and banks increasing the use of their own internal platforms means that “you can start to have an impact on the market at relatively low prices.”
The report came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had this week released from its stock trading department a trader who caused a loss of nearly $6 million at the end of last year.
The Bank immediately notified the competent authorities and cooperated with their supervisory authorities.
“We are convinced that this trader acted alone and that this problem has been resolved,” said Credit Suisse.
The number of people infected with HIV in Prague has exceeded one thousand
Doctors in Prague have recorded more than a thousand people with HIV.
From the beginning of monitoring in 1986 until the end of the third quarter of this year, tests confirmed the disease in a total of 1005 people from the metropolis.
This is due to the statistics of the National Reference Laboratory for AIDS of the State Health Institute.
According to her, 2,063 people have been infected in the whole of the Czech Republic.
In 396, the disease of failure of immunity has already passed.
198 people died.
The number of infections in the Czech Republic has been increasing every year over the last decade.
In 2002, tests confirmed the infection in 50 people, five years later there were already 121.
In 2009, the survey revealed 156 new infections, and in 2010, 180.
Last year, the number dropped to 153, but last year it was a record.
According to the lab, there were 212 of them.
"There is no doubt that the total number of newly diagnosed cases this year will exceed 200," says AIDS expert Miroslav Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD>, who led the Prague House of Light for Patients for years.
From October to the end of 2011, tests revealed the disease in 39 people and last year at 47, Hlavat<0xC3><0xBD> said.
In September, doctors recorded 21 new patients and three patients.
From the beginning of follow-up to the end of September, HIV tests confirmed in 1,710 men and 353 women.
AIDS was diagnosed in 161 men and 37 women.
The most infected were in Prague.
If you really want to get to know a city, you should go to the cemetery.
His visit will reveal more than a walk through the haunted center with monuments, churches and galleries, more than a bedecker would reveal.
Many people “read from the grave.”
They slowly roam the cemeteries and gain an intimate insight into the local reality.
They find out what kind of people live here, what nationalities they are, what beliefs they belong to, how large and cohesive families they belong to, at what age they die here, how rich they are, how important their titles and professions were to them.
How they express their social status, what their taste is.
And from the condition of the graves they will find out how they care for their dead remains.
Supreme Court Supports Obama's Health Care Act
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the health care bill signed by Barack Obama is in line with the constitution, a major victory for the Obama administration.
With a 5:4 vote, the court ruled that the individual regulation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which mandates citizens to purchase health insurance by 2014 – does not oppose the constitution on the basis of government tax authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts was on the side of four more liberal members of the court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy were in opposition.
The court also supported the remaining part of the 2,700-page law, and further ruled that the legal health care requirement, which orders states to extend the possibility of obtaining health insurance, otherwise threatens to remove all funding of health insurance from federal sources, and no provision is made.
A complaint was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Enterprises to block this law.
During the 2012 primary, the law was strongly rejected by each of the major Republican candidates, including prospective proposed candidate Mitt Romney.
"Mugabe is a limp donkey" no longer threatened by prison, court overturns law
Until now, Zimbabweans have had to pay close attention to how they speak in public about 90-year-old Mugabe, who has ruled the country since the early 1980s, and since the end of 1987 has been at its head.
Under section 33 of the Criminal Code, the president’s office was threatened with a fine of $100 for up to one year’s imprisonment.
“State attorneys should not be adamantly accusing people who comment on the president in pubs or other public places,” prosecutors said.
Nine judges unanimously agreed that the law undermines freedom of expression.
It is likely that the government will appeal the court’s decision, the BBC reported.
A number of injured Zimbabweans, including Tendai Danga, were arrested by police two years ago for allegedly insulting the president in a bar fight with a police officer.
In May, he ended up in prison for an opposition activist who was seen in public by Mugabe as a “blowing donkey”.
In August, the prosecutor then accused the 26-year-old man of intending to use Robert Mugabe’s face as toilet paper.
The court also ruled that it was an unconstitutional law restricting the freedom of the media.
"The state cannot punish people whose statements later turn out to be untrue," Deputy Justice Minister Luke Malala said.
Until now, Zimbabwean law has allowed a person who publishes false information to be sentenced to 20 years in prison.
“The existence of a law that allows someone to be criminalized for making false statements has a chilling effect on the right to freely express themselves,” Malala said.
Despite Mugabe ruling the country with a hard hand for more than 33 years, Zimbabwe adopted a new constitution with broader civil liberties in a referendum in March.
Small steps have been taken since the country’s one-man dictatorship in 2009, when an agreement between Mugabe and the opposition put Morgan Tsvangirai in the prime minister’s chair.
However, the country continues to suffer from the economic crisis and until 2008 the highest inflation in the world, which exceeded 100 000 percent.
In 2009, the government completely abolished the national currency.
Today, Zimbabwe only pays in the currencies of other countries.
The impoverished economy is on the verge of Mugabe’s reckless agricultural reform.
In 2000, he redistributed the land of white farmers among his supporters and war veterans.
Most of them, however, had no experience with farming.
Central banks will keep the swap lines permanently
Temporary and bilateral agreements between the European Central Bank (ECB), the US Fed, the Bank of England and the central banks of Canada, Switzerland and Japan will become a permanent instrument that will allow banks access to global currencies whenever they need to.
The banks stated this in their joint statement.
“This is a very sensible step,” said Julian Callow, chief international economist at Barclays Bank in London.
"So far, all transitional instruments of this type have gradually become permanent, so it is not surprising in my opinion," adds Vojt<0xC4><0x9B>ch Benda, Chief Economist of BH Securities.
Central bankers are strengthening the bonds that began in 2007 when the international credit market first burst.
Central bank agreements allowed access to euros, dollars and other currencies to anyone who needed them.
The central bankers’ decision comes as the U.S. Fed prepares to end its program to support the U.S. economy, which could drive out the price of money in the global market even higher.
The swap contract is normally used to overcome the liquidity shortage of one currency while the liquidity surplus of another currency is present.
It can be understood as a store of one currency and a loan of another currency.
The ECB is launching a third attempt to restore confidence in the European banks.
The EU has agreed on banking supervision, the ECB will supervise 150 banks.
How Tipsport (not) deletes personal data.
More than a year ago, I made a registration on the website Tipsport.cz.
But I didn’t finish it because someone was sitting at the branch who couldn’t complete the registration from the internet.
And because I didn't want to drive to another branch, the registration went down, then I moved and that changed my address and my ID number.
When I wanted to complete the registration later, I was told that it couldn’t be done because I have a different OP number, address and that it just can’t be completed and that I have to request deletion of the data and make a new registration.
I have therefore done so and on 24.10.2013 I have written to the technical support that I request the deletion of all my personal data from the database according to the applicable law on personal data protection.
For a long day, I received technical support that I have to complete the registration at the branch.
This started the marathon of e-mails for technical support, where finally after the 4th emergency 25.10. they wrote that personal data at my request was deleted.
So one would think that he could make that new registration and here the problems started again first it wrote to me that my username is already occupied (I understand it was not deleted - it's not a personal data, but finally they deleted this too).
So I used a different username and it dawned on me that my personal data was already stored to complete the registration at the branch (how can they have stored something that they claim to have deleted?), so I contacted technical support again.
When I asked how it was possible, they wrote me that personal data was actually deleted on 25.10. and to send an email with that error.
I did this (about 3pm yesterday) and I was written off today that I registered the same day (31.10.2013) at 13.22 and that is why it is not possible, because I used the same name and date of birth.
What about the fact that I have been in contact with technical support for a week and I am dealing with them that this is still not possible.
And what about the fact that if it were true what they say (as it is not) no one could register with the same name or the same date of birth if this is already registered.
By the way, in those 13.22 I really registered, on the same name and date of birth, but I used a fake e-mail and phone number and the world wonders, a page appeared to me that sent me a link to the e-mail to complete the registration.
But how is it possible if you cannot register for the same name and date of birth?
Probably because Tipsport links the registration to the e-mail and phone number and simply did not delete the data as claimed.
So I again told the tech support that they're just lying (either intentionally or not knowing what they're writing) because what they're writing isn't true.
I have shown several screens that the problem with registration was already before 31.10. so "false" registration does not affect this.
Tipsport wrote me a strict sentence - I'm sorry, but by re-registering, we can't verify your claims.
And the communication ended.
It repeats the same sentence around the same time that the registration is linked to the name and date of birth.
They cannot even accept the fact that the registration was not completed by clicking on that link in the e-mail and thus did not even take place.
So if I summarize it, Tipsport not only hasn't deleted the data as they claim, but still lies when they claim the opposite.
What’s worse is that it’s easy to prove they’re lying and trying to make it look like the mistake is on the customer’s side.
By the way, after the introduction of this issue on my personal blog, things got a bit in motion and from the Technical Support came an email that they pass the matter to the check and I will be informed (after a week of urgency and arguing and warning of the same error).
Music plays in the subway on the bridge
Transport company hl. m. (DPP) Prague launched the project Music in the Metro.
The first vestibule, where the reproduced instrumental music plays continuously during the operation of the metro, is the Bridge of Line A at the exit to Wenceslas Square.
The test operation will take six months.
Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek presented his new double album, the band and three singers
The lyricist Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek brought to the hall of the Cologne Municipal Social House not only his completely new double CD Czech Calendar, but above all in the show Between Us singers Lenka Nova, Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Segrad and Ondru Ruml accompanied by the excellent Orchestra of Mat<0xC4><0x9B>ja Benka.
After the initial intro and acting study about the late musician, Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek gradually invited all three singers to the stage, he himself came with a candle in his hand and reminded the story of how the last time they played in Cologne and in the theater and throughout the city, an electric current went out.
"Otherwise in Cologne they produced two kinds of cards, with which I came into contact a lot," he recalled.
The same is true of President Zeman’s countryman.
"Perhaps we could do a tour of Z<0xC3><0xA1>kolany or D<0xC3><0xBA>bravce near Bratislava," he joked about the parents of other presidents.
Several times in the evening Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, who did not leave the stage and if he did not speak, sat at the table with a glass of wine, touched his new musical act.
The calendar was also made by Josef M<0xC3><0xA1>nes, who put it on the clock, about ice hockey but at that time he had no idea how we meet in those squares and chant, who does not jump, is not Czech.
That’s the name of a song from the Czech calendar, but we won’t play it here today,” he said.
Ondra Ruml, on the other hand, is said to have sung a very suitable song for him, "Sleep in the Day", singing at night and accompanying him on the guitar.
Otherwise, if he did not sing, he played drums, all three singers were accompanied by a band composed of keyboards, cello, guitar and double bass.
All three vocalists sang together a little bit of a thrashing To the side of the heart sits, which immediately spread the stage.
"I'm glad that you were interested in the song, which did not surprise me in the town of Kmoch," replied Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek.
After the recollection of Petr Hapka, I recognized in the presentation of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Segrad, in the original by Richard M<0xC3><0xBC>ller rewarded with a huge applause, Hana Heger was reminded of the song T<0xC3><0xA1>ta liked L<0xC3><0xAD>da Baarov<0xC3><0xA1> with Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek’s explanation of the communist ban and the substitution of Baccarat.
Composer Michael Koc<0xC3><0xA1>b was reminded of the song Sebasti<0xC3><0xA1>n, Segrado then sang a beautiful song of Prague, played by Jard Svoboda, a charming native and former Kol<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x88><0xC3><0xA1>k.
But that was the conclusion, the applause and the addition in the form of an optimistic song We are living in a wonderful time.
Another addition to the playlist was prepared, but the fans no longer applauded it.
Almost immediately after the concert, the whole four sat down at the table to sign not only the Czech calendar, but also an older CD, Michal Hor<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ek, his books and even the cover from the legendary LP and with possible interested people took a picture.
Berdycha with <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nek will complement Rosol and H<0xC3><0xA1>jek
At the final of the Davis Cup against Serbia, the non-playing captain of Czech tennis players Jaroslav Navr<0xC3><0xA1>til nominated four Tom<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Berdych, Radek <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nek, Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Rosol, Jan H<0xC3><0xA1>jek.
Czech representatives defend the trophy, but go to play on the opponent's field in the Belgrade arena, where the match will take place on the hard surface from 15 to 17 November.
The Czechs are in the final for the third time in five years.
"We know we're going to hot ground, it's going to be wild and as always we have to focus on our performance."
"We're going there with one goal - to get three points and sell the best," said <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nek, the winner of last year's final with Spain.
Secret wars: Syria, Libya and Iran.
Training for Obama on how to bomb Syria.
U.S. Command in Libya.
Top Gun in the Persian Gulf.
The Israelis have shown exactly what the bombing of Syria should look like.
Without unnecessary humbling, threatening, and millions of statements, they sent planes, hit the target, and returned.
Without being swayed by the official elimination of chemical weapons in Syria.
They refuse to confirm the whole action and no longer express themselves.
The exact opposite is confused and grossly perverted, acts not supported by Obama’s Syrian policy.
And the most satisfying part of the whole attack was what the Israelis bombed.
Don’t be fooled by the media’s claims that “Syrian base” or “supply to Hezbollah” was bombed.
I recently wrote here that while U.S. aid to the country’s secular insurgents remains only on a rhetorical level, Russia happily continues to supply weapons to Syria.
And it was the fresh supply of Russian missiles deployed in the port of Latakia that became the target of the Israeli attack.
That's a clear message.
And note that Israel again bombed the Assad regime, not the insurgents, although according to popular internet theories it should be the other way around.
The U.S. government awarded two members of the space force, probably the Delta Force.
It was not known until now that they distinguished themselves during the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.
It is known the heroic death of two former SEALs who defended the CIA compound in the city, in my opinion, they were members of a secret CIA team made up of former soldiers.
There has long been speculation about what the SEALs were doing at the consulate or even at a CIA residence located elsewhere.
Now it's clearer.
Anyway, the information that the CIA has its offices in Libya protected by machine gun nests (right on one such member of the SEALs died after a mortar attack) is quite surprising.
But even more surprising is the information about those two previously unknown heroes.
They were part of the U.S. command in Tripoli, and as soon as they received the report of the attack in Benghazi, they volunteered for the intervention and, together with five private contractors, made their way to the CIA compound in Benghazi.
The Obama administration is blamed for the fact that during that attack, that command was not deployed officially and completely, and that it simply hesitated to do anything.
The commander of the command seems to be releasing these volunteers without orders.
In any case, the fact that the country operates not once, but permanently American command, CIA agents and private contractors is quite interesting information.
And this is because until recently, there was no official recognition of such a thing, and even now we are only talking about some kind of NATO advisory mission in Libya.
It is good, though, that the US is half-assed in fighting terrorism in Libya.
Even if the national situation is to be resolved, it would be much more helpful.
The last place of the secret and permanent conflict that I want to write about today is the coast of Iran.
It is not so long ago that the media almost chanted the Iranian air force for the pursuit of American drones.
Little is known, however, about how Americans effectively protect their drones.
Of course, if he accidentally manages to find his drone in the air, there is nothing to be done about it.
However, if a drone is discovered by Iranians in the international space, the situation is completely different.
And so it happened that the Iranian F-4 Phantom pursued an American drone in international space over the sea, when there was perhaps the first sharp deployment of the American super fighter F-22 Raptor in history.
He tricked Phantom into optically verifying his weaponry without Phantom registering it on the radar or simply noticing it, and then when he suddenly appeared to him and urged the Iranian pilot to return home, the one without reputation listened.
It’s no surprise that the Phantom is an American-made aircraft that remembers the Vietnam War.
He can't compare himself to Raptor.
We want to show that Pilsen can still win, promises Rajtoral
It's a bit of a paradox.
While his team has not been successful in recent times, defender or defender Viktorie Plze<0xC5><0x88> Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral has the form that brought him back to the national team after a year.
He is also successful in shooting, playing with activity, after the procedure, a penalty kick was ordered in the match in Teplice.
Viktoria reached the final two rounds against Slavia and in Teplice after the victory, but in the end of these two duels she took only one point.
Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral believes that his team will break an unpleasant series in the match with Jablonec.
We want to show that we can win.
"I believe that we will defeat Jablonec at home," promises Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Rajtoral.
The team prepares for a difficult match with the Northerners, who play attacking football, carefully.
Everything is aimed at the match with Jablonec, the coach prepares us well, as we always draw a lot from the video analysis of the game of the opponent.
"I believe it will be a great game on Friday evening," the Czech representative of the fans attracts to the stands of Doosan Arena.
The last few games didn’t go as well as she wanted, but the word of the crisis of the defender Victoria refuses.
That’s how it goes in football, sometimes you’re in good shape and sometimes you’re in worse shape.
But I wouldn't talk about the crisis at all.
"I believe we will win on Friday and it will be good again," the West's defender said.
Victoria's team will once again rely on the support of fans.
"It's Friday night and I'd like to invite our fans who are great."
"I believe we owe them a win," Rajtoral added.
Jana Pé<0xC5><0xA5>ov<0xC3><0xA1>: Step back.
So I decided to take a step back, but when I think about it, it's not really a step at all, but a big leap - a leap back a few years, into my memories, into my childhood.
It's a memory of what it was like, not having any worries and just coming out of school and washing dishes, luxuriating and doing homework.
Although these "obligations", it was mostly just the theory, the wishes of the parents.
The practice was completely different - to run from school, throw a bag in the corner and run out.
Play ball games with other children, jump a potion.
Then, during the series, Helena and her boys sew a chain stitched festive napkin for Grandma's birthday.
And then after a few warnings to finally wash the dishes, luxuriate, apply wood in the bricks in the winter and do the tasks until after dark under the lamp (or rely on the classmate and instead of the tasks to write a loved version of addressed school love).
In the morning, breakfast homemade strawberry jam (from real fruit, not those jams that are sold now, the content of which next to strawberries did not lie) and drink it with tea from dried herbs, which my mother and I loved to collect.
I also remember those magical evenings when there was a grave silence in the room, when my sister and I were recording songs from the radio on cassettes that were running loudly in the old cassette tape of my mother.
And then we flipped the cassettes on the pen and played the same song all the time, our favorite, and drank a siphon to it.
Or we used to make phone calls across the table using cans that were tied to each other with a string - and when we were already on the phone to hear each other better, it was necessary to thoroughly clean our ears, the asylum seeker at the time was a sirka + wata.
The minimum wage was more than three times lower than it is now, and my parents were able to live with it so that we didn’t miss anything.
We didn’t need any of those iPhones, iPads, even cell phones and laptops or branded clothes.
The clothes were inherited from generation to generation and the best "accessory" to the wardrobe was a batiked t-shirt homemade by using SAVA.
From electronics, it was enough to satisfy us the mentioned mom's tape recorder and, at most, the Walkman, which we shared with our sister and which we used, by the way, just on the train on a school trip.
We found it more interesting to play with Aunt Hat Hop or Man, do not get angry, or as I have already said go "only" out.
When I was a little older we got under the trees video player, surely his parents saved a long time, but unfortunately it did not warm up for a long time in our house.
My younger sister was narrating a squid in it, said he was so good at popping the tapes, so she tried to see if he was sleeping and the squid.
Unfortunately, he was sleeping, but it was his last bite.
Well, and he still has this story on his plate today, poor thing.
She says that when Lenka was a little girl, she dragged a straw into the video and thought that she would play the recipe and not overplay it, so she can't bake it to this day.
I remember how we were able to communicate with each other, to make a deal without a cell phone, a computer.
My sister and I made a deal with my grandmother's granddaughter over the holidays, when we'll meet again next summer at Grandma's - and that's how it was, that's how it was.
We met.
Do you promise to see someone in a year?
I also remember the winter when the whole village and I ran outside, building snowmen, riding on a snowy hill near the church on bags stuffed with hay.
Then we had dinner with the whole family and talked about the past day.
Of course, before every dinner, my sister and I would hear the notorious phrase, “Go wash your hands!”
Yes, that’s true today, but you certainly don’t have soap attached to your tap in the lemon net in the bathroom.
After dinner, when my dad was "working" in the garage with Jarda from the village, my mom and I were lying on the floor, leaning our feet against the bricks, opening the door and looking at the flames and listening to the crackling of wood, which was made of stone.
We were closer – really – we didn’t count how many friends we have on social media, we knew how many friends we have, the real ones!
We communicated with each other - we talked - we didn't write messages every day through different chats, text messages.
There was no such thing, and yet we knew far more about ourselves.
And that's how I could go on for a long time.
It is nice to remember, especially if I add these memories by looking at the album, where the black-and-white photos are neatly glued together by black corners.
And if I didn’t know how old I was at the time, the year of taking the picture is always written on the back of the photo.
I see that even if the cut of the pot was not very suitable for us and we had pants after the cousin by two numbers larger, no one had laughed at us before, it was so normal (not IN).
And I'd rather go back to that step forward - into reality.
Until 2013, and I will wait for what the modern age will invent for my children.
What I know for sure is that these memories of mine are now for the young teenage generation at least somewhere "a hundred years behind the monkeys" and I think they miss a lot that they do not experience this "pre-baked" time either.
I wish they would!
Google, Samsung and Huawei sued over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of patents for Nortel, filed a lawsuit on Thursday for patent infringement against mobile phone makers, including Google, a company it oversold in a bankruptcy auction for Nortel.
The Rockstar consortium, which bought Nortel’s patents for $4.5 billion, sued the U.S. District Court in Texas of Samsung Electronics, HTC, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google has been accused of violating seven patents.
Patents include a technology that helps connect search terms on the internet with relevant advertising, the lawsuit states, which is at the heart of Google’s search business.
Representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that run on Google’s Android operating system, which competes heavily with Apple and Microsoft’s mobile products.
In 2011, Google made a starting price offer of $900 million for Nortel’s patents.
Google increased its offer several times and eventually offered up to $4.4 billion.
After Nortel was defeated by Rockstar in the patent battle, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, which was partly motivated by Motorola's patent group.
“Despite the failure to obtain the patents at auction that are the subject of the dispute, Google has infringed and continues to infringe the patents,” the lawsuit states.
Rockstar is seeking increased damages from Google because, according to it, the patent is being intentionally infringed by Google, as the lawsuit alleges.
Miloslava Cejpkov<0xC3><0xA1>: November smile
It came from the outside, from 4 degrees Celsius, which we're not used to yet.
At first, she put down her smile, the one that kept on giving in defense of her friendly surroundings.
She was relieved because it was a mask she decided not to wear in public.
He was honest at home only in the days when she was a grandmother and had grandchildren Elinka or Ad<0xC3><0xAD>ka around her.
And, of course, when her sons called her.
She remembered very well the lesson from the endless courses of business skills.
They were finally really fit.
So that she doesn't hurt her neighbor.
Then he flew to the corner.
Like a disguise on a mask.
November, or any other month, can't do that miracle to really smile, like when they were on a trip with someone who's been gone for almost three years.
Egypt appoints first freely elected president to office
Muhammad Mursi took the inauguration oath, but his triumphant day will hardly end the political unrest in Egypt.
Islamist Muhammad Mursi promised a “new Egypt” when he was ceremonially sworn in as the country’s first freely elected president, following Husn<0xC3><0xAD> Mubarak, who had been suspended 16 months earlier.
Upon his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursi also became the first freely elected Islamic president in the Arab world and the fifth Egyptian head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took an oath in front of 18 judges dressed in black thalers in a mansion built overlooking the Nile, reminiscent of an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are working for a better tomorrow, a new Egypt and a second republic," Morsi said at a ceremony broadcast live on state television.
“The Egyptian people today laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old U.S.-educated engineer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been the target of fierce attacks by individual governments for most of the 84 years since its inception.
When Mursi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time in a small convoy of cars, hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building.
Only a few hundred supporters gathered in front of the courthouse to celebrate the president, and unlike the presidential appearance of Mubarak’s period, the traffic was briefly halted so that the column could travel along a busy road connecting the city center with the suburbs to the south.
Mursi’s personal prestige, mockingly referred to as the Muslim Brotherhood’s non-charismatic “reserve tire,” has grown sharply since his victory and his Friday speech, which aimed to present him not only as a candidate for Islamists but also to all those who want to bring the authoritarians to the end of the rebellion.
"Egypt is today a civil-law, national, constitutional and modern state," Morsi, wearing a blue social suit with a red tie, told judges in a wooden-clad chamber, where he took the oath.
Mursi later traveled to Cairo University, where he was to give an inaugural speech.
While standing on guard, he received an official welcome from a military band that played the national anthem.
Field Marshal Husayn Tantavi was present.
His arrival was accompanied by chanting "the army and the people are one hand" from the mouths of hundreds of people gathered in the university's main lecture hall.
The University of Cairo was founded in 1908 as a centre for secular education and later in the 1970s became a stronghold of the Islamic student movement.
Mursi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahrir Square, the birthplace of the revolution that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian rule last year, and solemnly promised to re-acquire the presidential powers taken from his office by the military council that took them from the ousted will.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the court, rather than before parliament, as is customary, he submitted to the will of the army, suggesting that the struggle for power would continue.
Mursi’s speech in Tahrir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures.
In the ghettos there will probably be police specialists, they have to relieve the tension
Police specialists should work in the ghettos in the Czech Republic in the future.
They would spend half of their time here.
They would look after the order and solve the problems.
Thanks to their knowledge of the environment, they should contribute to reducing tensions between people from poor places and the inhabitants of the surrounding area.
In its proposal to reduce security risks, the Ministry of the Interior expects this.
According to him, the improvement of the situation in the country would mainly be helped by "accelerating social housing".
The document was discussed by the government.
According to the analysis, there were about 300 poor homes and neighborhoods in the Czech Republic a few years ago.
There were 80,000 people living there, mostly Roma.
Adults in the ghettos were out of work, families were dependent on doses, children ended up in "special" schools.
There was a commotion.
According to experts, the problem areas have increased by a hundred.
The relationship between the people and the others is strained.
Anti-Roma marches were held in several places.
People from the surrounding area also joined the extremists.
According to the interior, it is difficult for the police to maintain security and order in the areas with ghettos.
A key condition is "the consistent application of equal treatment in the enforcement of law".
But this is impossible without a detailed knowledge of the place and people.
The specialist would go on walks in the ghetto, where he would spend up to half of his service, the rest would serve in his circuit.
He'd be keeping an eye on the order in the problem area.
He would also know the local, so he could better deal with problems or offenses.
"Thanks to the connected trust, specialists will be more easily able to prevent a whole series of illegal actions," he said.
Specialists in the ghettos would receive surcharges, which are 500 to 1000 crowns per month.
The introduction of special police officers into the problem areas is to be paid from Norwegian funds.
The budget is about 600,000 euros (now about 15.5 million crowns).
The Czech Republic pays 15 percent of the sum, the funds 85 percent.
Preparations began this year, and a detailed proposal is now being prepared.
The project is expected to last until 2016.
The authors were inspired by their neighbors.
This mechanism has been successfully applied in Slovakia for several years, where the problem of socially excluded localities is incomparably higher than in the Czech Republic.
"There are so-called Roma settlements," the report's authors said.
How many specialists should be in the Czech Republic is not yet clear.
The answer is to give an analysis that identifies the places where a special police officer would be needed.
It will also depend on how much money the police will be able to release each year after the project ends.
According to the project proposal, the first selected police officers undergo an internship in Slovakia.
This training should be attended by five dozen members per year.
The most suitable candidates will come from them.
There should also be special training for police officers who will work in the ghettos.
According to the authors, social housing would help to improve the situation.
It should motivate and lead to integration.
According to the interior, it would have three categories.
The minimum standard would be met by hostels with precisely defined rules, such as the number of people per room.
The middle standard would be in smaller apartments.
A higher standard would be social housing, which would be comparable to ordinary housing.
Tenants would have to implement an integration plan that social workers would draw up with them.
They would have to follow the housing rules, take care of their health, send children to schools, retrain and actively look for work.
If they tried to integrate, they would move to a higher standard of living.
According to the interior, the housing system should work for at least 30 years until the next generation grows up "in a pro-integratively motivated environment".
The model of social housing is being prepared by local development and labour ministries.
They have until the end of the year to design it.
Karel Dr<0xC3><0xA1>bek: Coal Mountain - one of our youngest volcanoes.
Coal Hill is a prominent hill 3 km southeast of Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l.
Along with a few others, the evidence of volcanic activity in the Low Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k region at the time (from a geological point of view) is recent.
The last eruptions were at the beginning of the quarter.
Looking from a greater distance, on the top of the Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch there is a striking white plastered baroque pilgrimage church of the Virgin Mary Helpful, built in the years 1755 - 1765.
It replaced the original wooden pilgrimage chapel.
The host, who stood next to the church, did not behave.
Shortly after the completion of the church, an alley of four rows of linden trees was planted, about 1 km long.
The cross road on the Hill of Uhl<0xC3><0xAD><0xC5><0x99>sk<0xC3><0xBD> vrch is already the third version, the original one stood here after 1916, the second, from 2001 only lasted until 2004.
At fifteen stops there are wooden sculptures made by the local art sculptor Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Nedomlel.
He used different types of wood from the Low Autumn area.
Similarly, the rock foundations from the area form an interesting geological exposition.
The name of the sponsor is also indicated on each stop.
The coal mountain is the rest of the young volcano.
Although the data from radiometric age measurements are somewhat different, the last eruption here was about 1.5 million years ago.
It is therefore younger than the Great Red Sea (3.3 million years old) and older than the Venus Volcano (0.8 million years old).
The volcano was born with an explosion.
At the same time, she threw out a considerable amount of volcanic ash, together with fragments of rocks from the ground, which were burned reddish-brown.
At the end of this phase, lava poured onto the surface - today it is a layer of porous cinder up to 13 meters strong.
The second eruption spewed out red, brown-red and places up to black tufa.
Their layer is powerful up to 50 meters and its part is accessible in the wall of the quarry.
In the thickets there are striking volcanic bombs up to 1 meter in size. Even the second eruption was ended with lava pouring out.
At the end of the activity, lava emerged from the volcano, which today forms up to 50 m of a powerful layer of eucalyptus.
Volcanoes that alternate the release of volcanic ash with lava flows are the most common type of volcanoes.
Because they are actually composed of layers, they are called stratovolcanoes.
The original volcanic cone was gradually eroded.
However, he was only threatened by mining rocks in the quarry on the south side.
The most intensive mining took place here between 1953 and 1962.
Tufy were added to concrete, which was then lighter and had better thermal insulation properties.
Under pressure from experts and the public, the extraction was able to stop and thus preserve this unique place.
However, the problem lies in the porosity and small consistency of the rocks, which quickly ventilate, disintegrate and slide down the slope.
The wreckage is disappearing pretty fast.
To make the situation even more complicated, a warm, south-facing slope is an ideal place for some rare species of plants and animals.
Correction is therefore problematic, but over time it will be necessary to select and maintain a characteristic geological profile.
It is nothing new, similar profiles are maintained in a number of important locations.
You can get to the Coal Hill by the green tourist sign from Brunt<0xC3><0xA1>l or from Slezsk<0xC3><0xBD> Ko<0xC4><0x8D>ov.
Motorists can use free parking at the beginning of the July Avenue, where a short educational trail begins.
She moved from the villa to the pantry.
Ivana grew up and spent most of her life in a practical villa with a garden and swimming pool in one of the most beautiful Prague villa districts on O<0xC5><0x99>echovka.
However, the original owners of the house got it back in restitution and the tenants had to move with a small margin.
Ivana therefore quickly looked for a replacement housing for herself and her then-older mother.
From acquaintances received a tip for apartment 3 + kk in an older panel house on the opposite side of Prague.
"At first it was a shock, but the view from the fourth floor to the extensive forest park and the dam on the other hand inspired me," Ivana recalls on the first impression.
At first I thought it would be provisional for three years.
"Today we have been living here for more than thirteen years and not only because of the gradual reconstruction, I would not change," adds the owner.
Mother and daughter then moved from a one-hundred-meter apartment to a smaller one with an area of 62 m2 and distributed almost all the equipment.
The event was not simple, things were stored with friends and the gradual arrangement took almost a year.
The new apartment was in quite good condition, but the necessary modifications had to take place, for example, door painting or window replacement.
The previous owner broke the core, but the owner was most bothered by an impractically solved and unnecessarily large hallway, and on the contrary, a small bathroom.
By combining two rooms, a multifunctional living space was created.
The architects used plasterboard for the definition of individual zones and the division of the room, which allowed the new location of the lights.
The first intervention, which she decided to take after a few years, was to remove the partition in the living room.
This changed the layout of the apartment to 2 + kk, but the room gained airiness and opened a panoramic view of the surrounding greenery.
The next step towards a partial improvement of the standard was the replacement of the PVC floor with laminate.
Ivana couldn't handle the bathroom.
For years, I have been collecting magazines about housing and looking for inspiration.
In one of them, I recently discovered an interesting realization.
At the recommendation, I approached the young architect Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rov<0xC3><0xA1>.
"It was actually the most important step in the future," Ivana says.
Thanks to the reconstruction of the bathroom, it was also possible to modify the available hallway.
The architect combined the toilet and bathroom space and replaced the two doors with one sliding door with open wings, saving space.
The bathroom is timeless and also sufficiently barrier-free.
High-quality tiles imitate sandstone, in the shower there is a comfortable seat, at the toilet bidet shower.
The successful cooperation with Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rov<0xC3><0xA1> continued.
As part of the program How to Build a Dream, a quick but fundamental transformation of the living room took place, in which the architect Martin <0xC4><0x8C>en<0xC4><0x9B>k also participated.
In the space created by combining two smaller rooms, we had to get three functions, the dining room, the living room and the bedroom, without helping ourselves with the classical principles of optical division, for example, half-crosses or Japanese walls.
"This would, as a result, violate the openness and unity of the space," explains the architect.
It was originally possible to separate the bedroom and the living area.
It was enough to turn the backs of the two sofas and build a custom-made wardrobe between them.
The dining area defines the shades of the floor and the decoration.
On the floor in the kitchen and dining area, the architect used high-quality marble, the sliding door revived with wallpaper with a pattern.
The kitchen corner, if necessary, is covered with sliding panels with wallpaper.
The new anti-allergic marble floor has a number of advantages over the previous one made of laminate: a softer non-slip surface without joints and better sound insulation.
The system of recesses and ceilings made of plasterboard highlighted with color is an example of how you can work with the space in the panel.
I left the colors on the architects, I wanted it to be joyful.
"I like orange, I had the same shade in the previous apartment," says Ivana.
The graphic glass cladding with a floral magnolia motif is practical and creates a distinctive aesthetic element.
To the warm energetic tone, the architects chose white, which underlined the modern functional style.
In a small apartment, it was possible to store books, among other things, in the space under the window sills.
Everything is within reach, the lamps are comfortably controlled at a distance.
In the remodeled interior, the contrast of the new with the older works works perfectly, for example with a decades-old crystal mirror and with quality art objects that Ivana collects all her life.
The last one was the kitchen.
The cabinets were previously placed on both sides and the owner felt a bit like a tunnel here.
The architect subtracted their number and rearranged the layout.
Furniture in a simple design is made to order, the white surface softens slightly the pearly surface.
Thanks to an ingenious solution, the washing machine, dryer and dishwasher entered a small space.
The appearance of a small kitchen revived the all-glass lining of the walls above the worktop.
A unique graphic glass with a digitally printed motif is attractive, in addition, it is excellently maintained.
Ivana chose the magnolia flowers, which remind her of the popular neighborhood in which she lived for years.
Now she seems content here, too.
In the original bathroom was a small bathtub and a sink, the new owner chose a neutral shade of cladding.
The large shower room has a glass door Ronal.
The task was to create from the given environment a clear simple space in which functions and devices will be in harmony.
We have unified the interior material and color and tried its elegant, cozy, not too crowded appearance.
"Another condition of the assignment was a barrier-free solution with minimal obstacles and the possibility of easy movement around furniture and accessibility of objects of daily need," adds Kamila Doud<0xC4><0x9B>rov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The Supreme Court has ruled that some time can be prosecuted.
The Supreme Court ruled that former Prime Minister Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as can also be prosecuted for possible crimes that he could have committed before the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies in August.
He was protected only by procedural immunity, which applies to speeches in the House.
On the other hand, in the case of former ODS members Ivan Fuksa, Mark <0xC5><0xA0>najdra and Petr Tlucho<0xC5><0x99>, he decided that they could not be punished for possible crimes until they gave up their parliamentary mandate in November last year, Supreme Court spokesman Petr Kn<0xC3><0xB6>tig said.
By this decision, the court rejected the proposal of the public prosecutor Ivo I<0xC5><0xA1>tvan, who wanted to continue the criminal proceedings with the deputies.
According to him, they accepted bribes in the form of lucrative posts in state-owned companies for giving up their mandate and will not make problems in passing laws.
On the contrary, it is possible to prosecute the former prime minister who offered them these posts.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rt<0xC3><0xA1> also arrested an anti-corruption police officer
B<0xC3><0xA1>rt's defense attorney, Old<0xC5><0x99>ich Poverty, who represented him in the case of alleged corruption of VV members, also did not want to express himself too much about the case, but said: "Yes, I represent the client in this matter as well, but in view of the protection of the hidden facts, I cannot comment further."
According to the information, the case is handled by the General Inspectorate of Security Corps (GIBS).
The server tn.cz said that B<0xC3><0xA1>rta could buy classified information from the police.
According to the server prvnizpravy.cz, the case could have been related to the case of former police president Petr Lessy, whose appointment to the post of Bart allegedly sought.
However, the rights show that the detention of V<0xC3><0xAD>ta B<0xC3><0xA1>rta is not related to Peter Lessy.
Eva Krop<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokeswoman for the police presidency, declined to comment on the case, saying the case was being handled by the Prague City Prosecutor’s Office.
"We will not comment on this question with regard to the protection of classified facts," said <0xC5><0xA0>t<0xC4><0x9B>p<0xC3><0xA1>nka Zenklov<0xC3><0xA1>, a spokesman for the Prague State Prosecutor's Office.
B<0xC3><0xA1>rt's case is being supervised by the prosecutor there, and it is therefore indirectly clear from her words that the file or criminal proceedings are conducted in a regime of secrecy.
The reporter Novinek managed to catch up with his wife V<0xC3><0xAD>ta B<0xC3><0xA1>rta Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Klasnov<0xC3><0xA1> in the morning before their residence in Prague’s Kl<0xC3><0xA1>rov<0xC3><0xA1>.
She was just putting her suitcases in the car and leaving.
She refused to comment on the whole incident.
On Friday morning, the leader of the Dawn movement, Tomio Okamura, expressed his support for Bart’s arrest.
According to him, he has no idea what the case is about.
"Vit Bart was one of the many candidates of many parties for our candidate, and as I have repeatedly said before the elections, he was not and is not a member of the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomio Okamura," he added.
V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rt, who in the last early elections to the House of Representatives in the Pilsen Region unsuccessfully ran for the Movement for the Dawn of Direct Democracy of Tomio Okamura, is known for his corruption case for the compensation of members of the Public Affairs.
In April 2012, he was wrongfully sentenced to 18 months with a delay of 30 months.
Later, the sentence was changed and B<0xC3><0xA1>rta was acquitted of the charges.
“I want a contract in the NHL.
I still have the desire, the desire and the enthusiasm
For Prosla, the family has always been in the first place, so she wants to be fully subordinate at the age of 38.
Either he gets a job overseas and prolongs his career, or he ends his hockey career.
"I want to play the role of father and husband."
"I'm looking forward to it," says the hockey player, who is still waiting in vain for an offer.
Despite the fact that he is a well-known worker, who never cheats anything.
Despite the fact that he always leaves his heart on the ice and is able to tear down his teammates.
And despite the fact that he was Columbus' most productive player last season.
"But the desire to show everyone in me is still there," he says resolutely.
He may have to wait, reportedly worth it to the New York Rangers, who failed to enter the season and also have two injured supporters - attackers Rick Nash and Ryan Callahan.
What does your arrival to the Rangers look like?
It's just speculation.
Until I have something on paper, it's not worth it.
I know there's an article in the New York Post that says they should sign me, but that's it.
Nowhere else has it been said that this really happened.
Unfortunately, I'd like to announce that I have a contract, but I just don't.
They didn't even call you from the club?
Such communication in the NHL takes place on a daily basis.
The point is to get into a situation where the contract really comes in.
When, for example, a player is injured or someone is not able to walk and the crew is not walking.
There's a lot of different factors that have to come together to get that contract.
But in New York, there are similar circumstances, right?
Rick Nash is injured with Ryan Callahan and the team didn't make it into the season, so there's a chance, don't you think?
Of course, there's always that chance.
But the second thing is that you always need two sides to it.
I'd take a lot of offers today, but I haven't received any yet.
This is the reality that I have to live in.
You're flying to America on Friday, you're expecting something to just happen?
I’ve had those expectations since July 5th, when the free-player market opened up in the NHL, and still nothing.
Are you going to New York to remember?
I'm definitely not, I'm going to Tampa with my kids and my wife.
I look forward to the sun and to seeing you again.
Do you have your program planned?
It's because I'm a father and a husband, and that's what it's all about.
“I’m not a hockey player at the moment – I don’t have a contract and I don’t play games.
So I'm going to be a dad and a husband, and I'm looking forward to it.
“On Sunday, Va<0xC5><0xA1><0xC3><0xAD>k has two hockey games, it’s a holiday for me and my whole family when we can go and support our children in what they want to do.
Are you thinking you could do this in full-time trailers?
Of course, one can think about a lot of things.
This can happen, too.
I tried it three years ago when I missed 50 games because of knee surgery.
And I had a lot of fun.
One day it will get to such a stage that all the goals, wins and extras will not replace what you have at home.
Because family and children, that's the meaning of life.
Have the job you want.
I had a job that was the most beautiful thing I could ever meet, apart from my family.
You’ve had a lot of offers from Europe: do you feel like you want to play the NHL just because it’s the NHL, or is it because of the family that you want to be in America?
Since I am a hockey player, the first place - in addition to the family - belongs to sports success.
The NHL is the best competition in the world.
And from that comes family life.
My children, I'm sorry, our children -- my wife and I -- grew up in the States, started going to school there, and so on.
And we would be very happy if they continued this trend.
Because what we're going to argue about, in America, there's a possibility somewhere else.
We should offer them that chance.
Are you planning to stay in the United States permanently?
We will practice it as before.
This means that in the summer we will be in Bohemia on Hlubok<0xC3><0xA1> and around <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
And in the winter again in Tampa or where our steps will lead us.
It’s perfect to be still in the heat.
I have been very lucky in my life.
You could say that I went against him, it cost me a lot of strength and renunciation, and it took me a lot of things that I missed.
But hockey in return offered me a lot of options and this is one of them.
That my wife and I can choose where we live.
There are a lot of people in the world who crave this so that they can choose what to do and how to live.
How long will you have the will to persevere, train hard and wait for the offer at your age?
Yeah, so that's a question I can't answer.
I still have it in me today, the juice, the desire, the enthusiasm, the passion for the sport, the desire and motivation to prove to people that you still have in the NHL, that I'm still better than anyone else.
But I can't tell you how long it'll stay there.
That can't be planned.
So you can say that this season you will wait for it to come out and then decide what to do next?
I'm in a phase where I'm going day by day.
Recently, the CEO of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ announced that the decision to build the 3rd and 4th block of the Temel<0xC3><0xAD>n power plant will be postponed until the end of 2014 or 2015.
He justified this by waiting for the new State Energy Concept and the approval of Contracts of Difference by the government.
For these reasons, the current leadership of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ is trying to transfer its responsibility to the government - i.e. as a majority shareholder.
However, a qualified manager should give recommendations to the shareholders, not hide behind them.
Babi<0xC5><0xA1>: I only rule with Sobotka.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1> is starting to settle that his YES movement will not have time to learn the political craft in the opposition and that he will have to go straight to the government to create one.
The President has admitted it in an interview for the Law, which will be released tomorrow.
Business and marketing of <0xC5><0xA0>koFIN leads Abrahamek
His areas of expertise include product and marketing and strengthening cooperation with business partners.
He was replaced by Lu<0xC4><0x8F>ko <0xC5><0xA0>antora.
For the last 14 years, Abrahamek has linked his professional career with the automotive sector.
He worked in Toyota Motor Czech, followed by Fiat Czech Republic, where he was responsible for the Alfa Romeo brand and dealers for seven years.
His last position was Suzuki Motor Czech, in which he held the position of manager of the automotive division for over five years.
<0xC5><0xA0>koFIN was founded in 1992.
Police Evacuate Port of Los Angeles Airport for Shooting
There was a shooting at the Los Angeles International Airport this morning.
Police evacuated part of the airport, which is believed to have been Terminal Three.
Reuters, citing California media, claims that the men of the law shot an armed man with a rifle.
The Los Angeles Times, citing police, said a shooting occurred in which two to three members of the Transportation Safety Administration were injured.
How many people have been injured and whether there are any victims is still unclear.
Firefighters are talking about an event with more people injured.
CNN: Israel bombed a military base in Syria.
The target was Russian missiles for Hizballah.
Israeli warplanes reportedly bombed a military base near the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday.
With reference to an unnamed U.S. government official, CNN reported.
The Israeli press widely reported the explosion at the alleged missile depot, but the Israeli government did not confirm the attack.
An Israeli army spokesman declined to comment on the report of the attack on CNN.
"We're not talking about foreign media," she said.
According to a U.S. government source, the target of the Israeli strike was rockets and related equipment that the Israelis believe could be transported by the Lebanese Hezbollah militant movement.
The AP, citing another U.S. security official, reported that the target of the Israeli attack on the target on Syrian territory was Russian SA-125 missiles.
The second channel of Israeli television reported that the target of the attack was allegedly a highly modern Syrian air defense system.
Satellite images of the attack area showed a battery of Russian S-125 Neva missiles, according to the DPA.
In addition, they were said to have seen the batteries of the SA-3 missiles, including a command center with radar to monitor the missiles and their targets.
According to Israeli television, the recorded rockets ranged 35 kilometers and could carry a head weighing 70 kilograms.
Israel has reportedly bombed rocket deliveries inside Syria at least twice this year, CNN and the AP said.
The Israeli military has never responded to such reports, but has repeatedly stated that it will hit any delivery of weapons to Hezbollah or other groups designated as terrorist.
Does the internet mean the end of travel agencies?
Flight Centre seems to be successfully resisting this trend.
The company has updated its annual profit estimate and expects record profits from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects its annual pre-tax base profit to be between $325 million and $340 million, compared with $305 million to $315 million from the previous forecast.
If current developments are maintained, this will represent a 12 to 17 percent increase over the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
CEO Graham Turner said Flight Centre generated an 8% profit in the first half, and the second half began to see strong growth, particularly in Australian and British out-of-service travel.
“As of today, our 10 countries are profitable and several are heading towards record annual profits before interest and taxation,” he said.
This includes Australia and the UK, which have traditionally been our biggest earners.
Entrepreneurship with recreational activities picked up during the second half of the year in Australia, compensating for a slightly weaker domestic market with business travel.
Similarly, in the UK, Flight Centre performed well in the recreational sector, while corporate clients spent less.
The U.S. trade rebounded after a loss during the seasonally weaker half-year and is expected to make a year-round profit for the third time in a row.
Yesterday, Flight Centre’s shares were 3 cents higher at USD 38.20.
Greenpeace activists detained in Russia transported to St. Petersburg
Environmental activists detained since September in Russia for protesting against planned oil extraction in the Arctic have been transported from Murmansk to St. Petersburg.
This was reported today by AFP with reference to the international environmental organization Greenpeace.
At the same time, it claims that the original charges of its piracy activists have not yet been dropped.
“Greenpeace International has learned from diplomatic sources that 30 men and women detained in Russia after a non-violent action against an oil rig in the Arctic were transported from a correctional facility in Murmansk to a prison in St. Petersburg,” the organization said in a statement.
The reasons for the relocation of the detained activists are not clear; according to the DPA, it was a planned move.
The environmental authorities first accused them of piracy, for which they were threatened with up to 15 years in prison if convicted.
Last week, however, they announced that they would replace the charge with a milder insurgency, which faces a lower penalty with an upper limit of seven years of imprisonment.
However, Greenpeace said in a statement today that allegations of piracy by the authorities have not yet been released as promised.
That said, the arrests are now being charged with two felonies.
A powerful investigative committee announced last week that accusations of piracy would be replaced by accusations of rioting.
But when 30 inmates stood before the committee this week, accusations of piracy were not dropped.
Instead, new charges have been brought against everyone,” Greenpeace said in a statement.
The Russians detained three dozen members of the Greenpeace movement from 18 countries at Gazprom’s oil platform in mid-September.
Ecologists were on the Arctic Sunrise, which was sailing under the Dutch flag.
Since then, they have all been held in custody, against which they have appealed, but the court has rejected them all.
On the conditions of imprisonment, environmentalists complain.
Greenpeace Executive Director Kumi Naidoo said the move to St. Petersburg would make it easier for detainees to meet with families and consular staff.
However, there are no guarantees that the conditions in the new prison will be better than in Murmansk.
"In fact, they can be worse," he said.
One of the detained activists, Faiz Oulahsen, asked King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands for help.
In a handwritten letter published today by the newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, the monarch was asked to speak about their situation at a planned meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He claims that Maliki has a large share in the restoration of sectarian violence in Iraq, which is said to be partly a part of the fighting in neighboring Syria.
Schools should focus more on maths, spelling and grammar
During the English Literature class, students will be required to study at least one Shakespearean play, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry, and contemporary British fiction from 1914 onwards.
The test will also include “hidden text” to motivate deeper reading;
Combined English literature and language courses will be cancelled.
From 2015 onwards, students will be required to have a matriculation exam from the language, and will be invited to choose English literature as an elective subject.
The Ministry of Education is due to issue a new curriculum for English and Mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo radical change.
For other key topics, changes are expected next year.
In a separate step, Ofqual, which oversees the graduation exams, will reveal changes in the structure of the graduation exam, along with a new marking system and a smaller volume of projects for students.
In a speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was “a broad consensus as to whether we need to reform our testing system in order to regain the trust of society” and that it was necessary to insist that the graduation test be “more demanding, more ambitious and more rigorous”.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week – than most other countries.
For comparison, maths in Australia spends an average of 143 hours a year and in Singapore about 138.
While there will be no official requirement to devote more time to mathematics, coalition sources have stated that a comprehensive maths probate exam – along with a greater emphasis on this subject in the scoreboards – will likely encourage schools to provide extra teaching.
The curriculum will focus more on “real-world problems,” including financial mathematics.
Ostrava Mayor Kajnar: I am not a cancer survivor in <0xC4><0x8C>SSD
Before the elections, a long-running dispute broke out between two wings fighting for influence within the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
It all culminated when the mayor of Ostrava, Petr Kajnar, turned to the court for the undemocratic composition of the candidates.
The actors of the case, however, did not want to express themselves too much, so as not to hurt the party even more before the elections.
Voters’ votes are now counted.
The leadership of the Ostrava-based <0xC4><0x8C>SSD called on the mayor of Ostrava to step aside on Monday evening, and will probably push for him to lose his job.
Petr Kajnar wants to keep fighting.
What is in dispute and who is on whose side, he described in an exclusive interview for the Journal.
How do you see the outcome of the election?
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD certainly expected a much better result.
Has it damaged our country by the fact that disputes within the party were resolved in the media before the elections?
I can imagine that social democracy could have a better electoral outcome.
But on the other hand, it corresponds to the state in which <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is now.
It’s a party that has its own internal problems, it’s internally sick and people feel that everything is not right in it.
They made that clear in the election.
What are the internal diseases of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD?
I think the decline has been going on for some time now, and unfortunately things like this are happening in social democracy.
The fact is that lobbyists, influential people who had previously expected to find their way around the ODS, moved to the people in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and have an influence on them.
This has to do with the fact that the Ostrava magistrate’s offices are run by the police and collect computers.
It shows that <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is not only composed of people who would like the good of everyone else, but many of them think primarily for their own good.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD is divided into two irreconcilable camps in Prague, as can be seen in the current struggle for power between the Ha<0xC5><0xA1>kovets and the Sobotkovets.
But this has been preparing for a long time.
What happened before the elections in Ostrava was just a foretelling of what is happening now in Prague.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek's wing gradually occupied positions, so that after the elections it could provoke a situation that weakens Sobotek's wing.
A person is in politics in a situation where he sometimes has to make compromises.
But everyone has an internal border where compromises can no longer be made, and that is my case.
Originally I did not want to run for the House, but when I perceived the whole thing inside the party, I agreed with Lubo<0xC5><0xA1> Zaor<0xC3><0xA1>lka that I would try to get to the regional candidate to strengthen the Sobotka wing as mayor of Ostrava.
Hash's wing, however, made a mark on it.
Why are you on the side of Bohuslav Sobotka and not Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek?
Slavek Sobotka is, in my opinion, a person who always talks primarily about the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD program and to some extent also about visions for the party and for this country.
I have to admit, I didn’t hear anything like that from the other side.
Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek is just fighting for power.
I do not understand how the Presidency, which is a lower authority than the Central Executive Committee, can only begin to dismiss the Party President.
This is a struggle for power, no matter what, and against the party’s settlements.
In my opinion, by what Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek has now shown in Prague, he has ended his political career.
How did you feel that the Ostrava leadership of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD did not approve you as a candidate?
Political parties are based on a competition as to which of their members will be placed.
The competition should be largely based on program visions and the ability of those people to fulfill those visions.
Of course, there are also people who do not have much ability or vision, but the political party is for them an elevator to money that they would not get elsewhere.
The problem is when these people begin to get to the forefront by unscrupulously breaking the rules, violating the party’s statutes.
Their practices make the political parties of the mafia and, in my opinion, they also violate the laws of the Czech Republic.
To point out this problem is more important to me than to consider whether any Kajnar has any political future.
It is important that the parties begin to respect the statutes.
That is why, before the elections, you submitted a proposal to the court for preliminary measures against the form of a candidate of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in the Moravian-Silesian region?
The current district executive committee of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD in Ostrava consolidates its power by the fact that organizations that do not suit it can cancel, purposely establishes new organizations, gradually expels uncomfortable members of the party.
An example is that they wanted to exclude Richard Bedna<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k from the club of representatives, but he filed a lawsuit against it and they then rather canceled the resolution on his exclusion.
This shows that demanding compliance with party statutes through the courts is the last option, but the moment those other ways and control bodies within the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD have ceased to function, it is the only option.
The effort of the Ostrava <0xC4><0x8C>SSD leadership led by MP Adam Rykala is to remove you from the position of mayor.
It is a public secret that the mayor of Poruba, Lumir Palyza, has a preference for this post.
It is so, Adam Rykala and Lum<0xC3><0xAD>r Palyza are trying to do everything so that they can appeal me.
They promise people positions, they gain votes, and then they consolidate their power in the party behind those votes.
When I go back to the past, everything that happened around the Ban<0xC3><0xAD>k Ostrava football club and the purchase of the Bazaly stadium was just a pretext for them to attack me.
It was artificially staged so they could label me as a person who gives money where it doesn’t belong.
At the same time, the city has bought a property that is strategically important to it.
So how do you see it with your tenure as mayor?
The district committee has already called on me and other people on Monday to consider their stay in the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
But I think it's like when a thief yells, "Catch a thief!"
When we look at the results of my work over the last eleven years, I see no one in Ostrava’s social democracy who would initiate and promote, sometimes even against party members, the emergence of so many development issues, such as industrial zones or the expansion of the science and technology park.
And yet, everything becomes uncomfortable.
I don’t read it any other way than to prevent others from getting to the places they want to go.
Will you continue to fight these efforts?
Because if this republic is to work well, political parties must also work well.
I can hardly believe that any party will be able to effectively govern the state when it is unable to govern itself.
So I don’t think I’m going to leave <0xC4><0x8C>SSD now, because I think it’s not me who’s causing this side’s cancer, it’s these people who are trying to piss me off.
Olomouc opens a public skating rink in the historic center
Organizer of Olomouc Christmas markets and winter skating Pavel Sp<0xC3><0xA1>len<0xC3><0xBD> said that preparatory work on the ice rink was started on October 26 and since Wednesday there is an ice production unit in operation.
The ice sheet is already seven centimeters thick and by Friday morning the area will be ready for the first visitors.
The playground has an area of 375 square meters, the podium took 358 square meters.
There will also be two benches with a punch for the skaters and passers-by.
"We expanded the floor area, increased the space in front of the stands, and almost the entire surface of the podium is covered so that skaters can comfortably rewind," Burnt said.
The streets of Olomouc are reminiscent of Christmas.
Last year, due to the repair of the Lower Square, the skating rink was installed directly in front of the main entrance of the town hall on the Upper Square.
The repair of the Lower Square was completed at the end of the summer, so that the ice surface could return to its original place.
For the first time, people could skate directly in front of the town hall in 2009, when the skating rink was in operation from January to March.
The ice sheet then became an integral part of the city’s Christmas markets.
Christmas markets, which include a rich cultural program, will be opened in the Upper Square a month before Christmas Day.

The brutal murder of a senior in Zl<0xC3><0xAD>nsk will be solved again by a regional court
The regional court acquitted the charges of a twenty-five-year-old Slovak and a twenty-two-year-old Czech for lack of evidence.
The men refused the blame.
They are at risk of 15 to 20 years in prison or even an exceptional sentence.
Spokesperson Petr Angyalossy confirmed that the Supreme Court had overturned the regional decision and returned the matter to him for discussion.
The judge refused to comment on the grounds that the decision had not yet been delivered to the parties.
According to the indictment, the young men assaulted a seventy-year-old man in his home.
The old man died a horrible death.
According to the indictment, the men cut him, beat him, and kicked him all over the body, and also put about three dozen blows to his head with a metal object, apparently a gas gun.
The man suffered serious injuries, such as fractures of the skull bone, swelling of the brain or bleeding into the brain, which he succumbed to on the spot.
The youths allegedly took away about 3,000 crowns and jewelry worth about 14,000 crowns.
According to the regional court, they were the only, moreover, indirect evidence against the accused smell trail, which the expert assessed as not fully established in terms of legal guidelines.
Traces of smell from the crime scene and on other things, although in more than ten cases, coincided with the defendants, but the police initially treated them as a matter of fact and not as traces of smell.
In addition, a certain error in dealing with them was found.
According to the Senate, the guilt of the defendants was not proven without any doubt.
However, the court acknowledged that the police had very difficult conditions.
A dead elderly man with a broken head was found by relatives who thought he had fallen and injured himself.
The emergency services doctor, who was called in, did not even report the violent death.
After a few days, the criminals contacted the doctors, who discovered signs of violent death during the autopsy.
The police could no longer work with all traces of the crime scene that relatives had cleared.
No DNA of the defendants was found at the scene.
The young Slovak lived in Uherskohradishtsk.
He is now serving a sentence of 8.5 years, which was confirmed last year by the competent Olomouc Supreme Court.
According to him, the man was the head of an organized group of six young men who are accused of stealing gold.
The robberies took place in October and November 2011, shortly after the murder of a senior in Slopn<0xC3><0xA1>.
The youngest of the accused in the murder of a senior resident lives in Uherské Hradi<0xC5><0xA1>t<0xC4><0x9B>.
The court released him from custody in August after 11 months.
Znojmo starts with the reconstruction of the stadium
At the beginning of November, the reconstruction of the football stadium will begin in Znojmo.
On Thursday, the stadium was taken over by the builders, who will carry out the reconstruction of the lawn.
The reconstruction of the city stadium in Znojmo is divided into four stages to meet the standards for the first football league.
The living legend Wayne Shorter closes the week of the Strings of Autumn
The saxophone giant and jazz legend Wayne Shorter will make the next mid-point for the 18th edition of the Autumn Strings festival.
Shorter will perform on November 6 at the Great Hall of Lucerne along with his quartet of Danilo Perez, John Patitucci and Brian Blade.
In the second half of the evening, a spontaneous jazz improvisation PKF - Prague Philharmonia under the direction of Martin Kum<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xA1>k will be added to Shorter.
Shorter's arrangements for the symphony orchestra will feature Pegasus from the new album Without A Net, as well as his older compositions Lotus and Prometheus Unbound.
Although he celebrated his 80th birthday in August this year, Shorter is still full of strength, which also proves that the Prague concert at Struny in autumn will kick off his world tour.
Wayne Shorter entered the world of music more than sixty years ago.
The list of performers he has collaborated with ranges from Miles Davis to Herbie Hancock, Joni Mitchell to Carlos Santana.
On his musical journey, he met the Czech musician Miroslav Vitous and the Viennese native Joe Zawinul, with whom the legendary Weather Report for more than a decade gave direction to a new style of fusion.
He has performed with the Wayne Shorter Quartet for the last 13 years.
Afterparty after the festival there will be a club night Spotlight, which will take place on November 9th at the club Roxy/NoD.
In addition to the charismatic singer Andrey Triana, the Manchester trio Go Go Penguin will present their jazz-influenced electronics and young jazz talent Ian Mikyska, who will bring the electro-jazz band Profound Bass inspired by dance styles.
Uefa has banned the publication of penalties for referees.
Dagmar Damkov<0xC3><0xA1>, Chairman of the Committee of Referees of the Football Association of the Czech Republic, stopped publishing sentences for the courts.
She is banned by UEFA rules, which she said in an interview with the daily Lr<0xC3><0xA1>vo.
Otherwise, it would be a threat to the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R.
Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> also denied that she would banish football players from Pilsen, where she came from.
These speculations are really pointless.
It is true that I live in Pilsen, but the other members of the commission are from elsewhere, for example from Prague.
So in the case of voting I can lose 1:6," Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> said in response to the criticism, which was outraged after Plze<0xC5><0x88> recently played twice as many penalties as other league teams.
Although in recent months the FA<0xC4><0x8C>R has stopped publishing sentences for arbitrators, Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> assures that the judges are angry for their mistakes.
"Believe me, if the commission finds that the referee has made a mistake, it will limit his delegation, whatever the match," Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
The reason why the penalties are not published is according to Damka’s ban from the European Football Union.
"UEFA prohibits the publication of such information and punishes the violation severely."
"We're very suspicious, and we're looking for something for every mistake."
"We have published the restrictions, but I have received two very strong warnings that if we do not stop this, there will be tough sanctions," Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> said.
Other countries respect the ban.
"We were really the exception," she added.
If the release of the information continues, the commission could lose money from UEFA for the education and development of referees.
"And these are very important to us."
"Without them, we would not be able to fulfill the program for the training of referees," Damkov<0xC3><0xA1> added.
B<0xC3><0xA1>rta’s detention is related to Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek and Bém: Is he behind the escape of the wiretaps?
V<0xC3><0xAD>t B<0xC3><0xA1>rt, the president of public affairs, was arrested by police on Thursday.
Along with him, Jan Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek, head of the department of analysis and computer science of the anti-corruption police, was arrested.
The arrest is related to the interrogations of lobbyist Roman Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek and former mayor Pavel Bém (ODS).
The information about the interviews, which was provided by the Novinky.cz server, was confirmed by a reliable source to the Czech Press Office.
Listening to the phone calls of Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek and Bém, published last March by the newspaper Mlad<0xC3><0xA1> fronta Dnes and in which the two men address each other "Maz<0xC3><0xA1>nku" and "Kolibr<0xC3><0xAD>k", show Janou<0xC5><0xA1>ek's influence on the city's actions under Bém's leadership.
The newspaper then reported that they were acquired in 2007 by the Security Information Service (BIS), from which two years later they escaped to the ABL security agency.
That's where he owned Bart.
The server Novinky.cz pointed out that the detained criminalist Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek was working for the BIS before he joined the anti-corruption police.
Petr<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>lek moved to the anti-corruption department, which subsequently dealt with the wiretaps, at the same time that they were published.
"With regard to the law on the protection of classified information, I cannot confirm or say anything at all," said prosecutor Michal Muravsk<0xC3><0xBD> of the Prague State Prosecutor's Office.
He also refused to confirm that he was monitoring the case.
The case does not want to comment on the inspection for the same reason.
Six companies out of ten are preparing for the new Civil Code
Six out of ten companies are intensively preparing for the coming effectiveness of the new Civil Code and the Commercial Corporations Act from 1 January 2014.
Only eight percent of the company representatives surveyed said they had not addressed the issues related to the two key codes in their company at all.
This is the result of a survey by the law firm Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal, which examined the opinions of 108 Czech companies.
In the context of the near term of effectiveness of both key codes, it is only now at the last minute that a number of managers are beginning to realize how they can have a significant impact on the business of their companies.
In our opinion, the biggest changes in private law in the last 50 years will affect all citizens and companies in the Czech Republic.
Because of the lavoring of politicians, the business sector has long lived in uncertainty as to whether revolutionary changes will eventually take place or not.
"Now, however, they have only a few weeks left to make the transition to the new law without complications for their companies," said partner Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Jan Spa<0xC4><0x8D>il.
Of the 61 percent of companies intensively engaged in new legislation, 26 percent said their companies had already taken all necessary measures to be prepared in time.
In addition, 35 percent of these companies are preparing to take the necessary measures in the near future.
In contrast, every fifth company has not yet dealt with recoding, yet has a specific idea of how to prepare for them.
A total of 11 percent have no opinion and are unable to assess the issue.
Only 8% of companies admit that they have not yet addressed the issues related to recoding.
The most important legal topic related to the new Civil Code is for the largest number of companies surveyed the conclusion of new contracts (21 percent), followed by the resolution of business conditions (16 percent) and further changes in the property register and liability for damages (after ten percent).
In the case of contracts, one of the most important novelties of the entire recoding will take place, namely the unification of contract adjustments only within the framework of the new Civil Code.
The current parallel regulation in the Civil and Commercial Code will disappear, as a result of which the contract law should become more transparent for citizens and entrepreneurs.
"In the case of entrepreneurs, the new arrangement will offer many novelties with an emphasis on greater freedom to organize relationships," said lawyer Ambruz & Dark Deloitte Legal Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Poddan<0xC3><0xBD>.
In connection with the Law on Commercial Corporations, almost a quarter of companies consider the issue of increasing the liability of statutory bodies to be the most important topic.
The following are topics related to changes in the convocation and the course of the general meeting (15 percent) and the representation of the company (14 percent).
The new legislation means tightening the obligations and possible consequences for statutory authorities, especially in a situation where companies are at risk of bankruptcy or falling into it.
"In practice, this means that if the members of the board of directors and the directors of the companies do not act with the care of the proper owner and do not avert the impending bankruptcy of the company, they can lose the benefit gained for the performance of the function for the last two years," he added.
Pierre Rainero: I’m trying to make Cartier’s style a living language
My task is to preserve the tradition and at the same time lead our brand to modern things, so that it does not remain a dusty relic, explains in an interview for HN its position Pierre Rainero, style director at Cartier.
This French luxury house was built in 1847.
Travels through mud, river and jungle and provides free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free medical care in villages in Cameroon.
Bwelle and his team treat hundreds of patients almost every weekend.
There are not too many doctors in the countries of West Africa; only one per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile phone.
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 candidates for the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year award.
In the 2013 CNN Heroes of the Year award contest, you can vote for him or any of the top ten candidates.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue their extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his father fall unconscious again and again and drive to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near the capital of Cameroon, Yaounde.
At first, he was treated only with a broken hand, but then he developed an infection that spread to the brain, and there created a hematoma that affected him throughout his life.
"There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon," says Georges Bwelle.
We'd have to take him out of Cameroon if we had the money to do it.
Instead, Bwelle spent years transporting his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals, where he received treatment that was simply available.
"It's not easy," says Bwell.
You can leave the house at five in the morning, rush to the hospital to be there first, but you are not the first.
There are many patients there.
Some people die just because they have to wait.
Since Bwelle’s father died in 2002, the situation has not changed much.
According to the World Health Organization, Cameroon has only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is one doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if the Cameroonian doctors could visit, many would not be able to afford it.
Two out of five people in this country live below the poverty line, and nearly three-quarters of healthcare spending in this country is private.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” says Bwell.
Because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
When Bwelle saw his father and many of his countrymen suffer, he decided to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a physician and vascular surgeon at Yaounde Central Hospital.
And he founded the non-profit organization ASCOVIME, whose members visit rural areas over the weekend, where they provide free medical care.
Since 2008, almost 32,000 people have helped with their group of volunteers.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people rush to the deliveries, attach medical needs to the roofs and travel rough terrain to villages in need of help.
They are not always accompanied by happiness.
Vehicles have to push through the river and mud several times.
But when they arrive, they are greeted as real heroes: a feast, singing and dancing, and the best accommodation the community can offer.
In these villages, free medical care is a real reason to celebrate and Bwelle – with his wide smile and unbridled energy – is very willing to engage in local fun.
The next day, the team began treating hundreds of patients.
"We have 500 patients on each expedition," says Bwell.
They come to the village from a circle of 60 kilometers, on foot.
During each of these weekends, doctors provide a variety of medical assistance.
Many are treated with malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasitic diseases and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others can get free glasses or gift glasses or birth certificate – a document that the school requires, but which many impoverished families simply can’t afford.
In the evening, the team performs a simple operation under local anesthesia.
Surgery is usually done in the school building, in the town hall or at home; after the operation, the patient gets up and goes to the recovery site to free up space for another patient.
With the help of light from the generator, operating room and hygienic equipment, Bwell and his volunteers work until early morning hours.
It’s exhausting, but village musicians usually help the team not to lose motivation.
“To stay up and keep working, they play drums all night,” Bwelle says.
On Sunday, the team will head back to the city, tired but proud of their work.
This group – made up of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – performed 700 surgeries for free last year and realizes that their help can mean a lot to the local population.
One man said he would be able to work again after the hernia surgery.
"This will change our family's future," the man said.
In addition to organizing these weekend clinics and the work of a surgeon at Bwelle Hospital, he also works at night for private health clinics around the city of Yaounde.
He says that it is this second work that funds about 60% of his non-profit activities; the rest is covered by private contributions.
“I’m not sure when he’s actually sleeping,” says Katie O’Malley, who is a second year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer for Bwelle’s group.
He is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can do these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O’Malley, who came from the United States or Europe to join Bwelle on his mission, it’s a great practice they wouldn’t get at home.
“We washed Dr. Bwell’s hands thoroughly and removed the blood stains or held his instruments,” says O’Malley.
You will never experience this as a second-year medical student in America.
Students volunteers usually pay for a trip to Cameroon themselves and often arrive with donated medical supplies.
But once they arrive in Yaounde, food, transportation and study are provided by Bwelle.
"He's definitely a hero," says O'Malley.
This organization gives its life and its desire to help the people of Cameroon is endless.
Bwelle's constant cravings are not a burden.
Helping others live happier, fulfilling the promise he made to his father, is something that brings him great joy.
"I'm so happy to be doing this job," says Bwell.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Laughing at people, relieving their pain – that’s why I do it.

Minister Holcat restored the position of Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic
The head nurse for the Czech Republic should represent the interests of nurses, whose number in the Czech Republic exceeds 100,000.
"I consider it essential that this function be clearly defined and formalized, that the nurses have their representative within the structure of the office - a representative to whom they can always turn if necessary," said Martin Holcat, Minister of Health.
I appreciate the work of the nurses and I think that the nursing profession deserves to be given due attention by the Ministry.
In the pursuit of this profession, you need not only a high level of professionalism, but also a human approach and personal conviction.
"I will gladly and with all responsibility strive to promote those steps that can improve the position of nurses."
"We have excellent and skilled nurses in our health care, but I would also like to appeal to those colleagues who do not help us too much with their approach to patients, to carry out their professions with all their empathy and to help us improve the image of nurses in the eyes of the public," says Alena <0xC5><0xA0>midov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Newly appointed Chief Nurse for the Czech Republic Alena <0xC5><0xA0>midov<0xC3><0xA1> also stated on the occasion of her appointment that she wants to deal with various aspects of the nurse’s job position and intends, among other things, to cooperate with professional associations, professional companies, educators, other non-medical electives.
"I don't want to separate the professions of doctors and nurses, but on the contrary, I see them standing side by side, with everyone having their own competencies and together with other health professionals forming a playful work team that provides health services for the benefit of the patient."
"I myself face a number of problems that occur in the performance of the profession of nurses, I perceive these difficulties and I intend to contribute to their solution."
These include, for example, ensuring the simplification of nursing and medical documentation.
"I know from my own experience that some of my sister's administrative tasks unnecessarily burden and take up the time they could and should rather devote to patients," says Alena <0xC5><0xA0>midov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Other areas that it intends to focus on include improving working conditions, finding ways to better cooperate with the team and with the management of health service providers, adjusting competencies and also employment law issues, such as compliance with the Labour Code or not overburdening the nurses’ time.
We often hear anonymous conspiracies, but for fear of possible punishment, they are not documented in a specific case where a violation of the rules could occur.
"Where there is no prosecutor, there is no judge, so the position of the Chief Sister of the Czech Republic could serve as a guarantee of the anonymity of such a complaint and have a specific case examined by the competent authorities," concludes Alena <0xC5><0xA0>midov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Alena <0xC5><0xA0>midov<0xC3><0xA1> graduated from the Secondary School of Medicine in the field of Nursing (graduated in 1978) and the Faculty of Philosophy of Charles University in Prague in the study program Nursing - Pedagogy (graduated in 1992).
Since 2010 he has been working as head of the department of nursing and other non-medical fields and recognition of qualifications at the Department of Education and Science of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
During her professional career, she worked as a nurse in bed at the internal department, and she worked as a teacher at the Secondary School of Health, where she was also a statutory representative of the director for 8 years.
From 2004 to 2009 she worked as the head nurse of the Prison Service of the Czech Republic.
She has published several professional nursing textbooks and articles in professional magazines, she has been engaged in lecture activities in the field of nursing.
He is not a member of any political party.
So that I don't get entangled in hate
Writer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Kahuda returned to writing after twelve years.
After many years of reading, living, but not writing, V<0xC3><0x81>CLAV KAHUDA (1965) publishes a new novel Wind, Darkness, Presence.
That it will not be a neat volume, suggests the number of pages comparable to his most famous work Houstin (Petrov, 2001).
For Salon Kahudu, another prominent Czech writer of the present day - Emil Hakl.
What's the point of writing a novel after 12 years of silence?
I did it so I wouldn't get caught up in hate.
To see around us ever new and new clones of the human foolish trifle, young organisms affected by blind selfish effort.
I’m not even talking about us elders, faces ruined by impotent desire, a whining soul, and the oppositely over-polished ideologues who try to sell their “product” with the expression of a little sell-out whore.
At the beginning of the millennium, I bought a small digital camera and filmed my juridical friends, wonders and hidden formations.
I've missed it.
Sometimes I feel my brain burning out of life on this planet.
I prefer to go for walks and then I read books at the lighthouse in the evening.
You're talking about a sense of desperation, of hatred.
Was there a breakdown in the past that affected you, or are you just getting older, like all of us?
The fracture occurred a long time ago, at about ten years of age.
It didn't have a name back then.
Well, and then I lived.
But there's still a quiet boy in there somewhere.
I see other lonely exercisers, each in their own tornado of anxiety.
I was saved from writing books.
I am participating in this immense, thousands of years of movement of the life system on this planet - the birth of an incomprehensible future.
This immense, breath-taking complexity of life, where every stone is the direct heir to our presence.
We are the players of a sad and beautiful game, when by way of trial and error another generation of beings arises, which in trillions of interactions per second creates some kind of superhuman, artificial intelligence.
Twelve years is a relatively long time.
Do you see your writing as an ongoing process, or do you start from scratch?
Self-talk, or rather the dialogue that leads the right and left half of the brain, sometimes floats to the surface and forms itself in a book.
As the periods of peace are interspersed with the silent metastases of war, which may one day awaken - so has the book's twelve years of silence clothed in words.
I felt the silent avalanche of life growing in my brain, and if I don't do anything, I'll be silenced one day.
It is a set of questions formulated by the brain and placed in layers that are stored in the dark "under the level of consciousness".
The neocortex, the grey cerebral cortex, questions the older evolutionary formations, going to the ancient clumps of the brain tree.
He speaks to the furry beasts, he asks the serpents, he seeks an answer in the flight of birds, he raises his eyes to the clouds in the sky.
Yes, the moral law in me and the starry sky above me.
In the end, the brain asks the world.
Relatively often you express yourself to the ego metaphorically - could you define it biologically?
The brain stores in its billions of connections and electrochemical bonds all the memories, experiences and experiences that the person in question has experienced.
This forest of logically and emotionally exposed and branching trees of information, memory registers, uses the brain in its cognitive, cognitive, process, is exposed to constantly changing presences, in an unceasing effort to name and understand its surroundings and decode the important.
Sometimes there are problems with overloading.
Analogously - as if you "fell" the PC, from the program of the speech emulator and translator from foreign languages would be confused first in the operating environment, for example, Windows, and after several unsuccessful restarts ended with a dark green flashing screen of Bios, in the basic system that controls the process and the interface.
For those who have not yet understood what this is about - I am talking about the psychospiritual crisis.
You mention it often - why do you care about this type of regression on a regular basis?
Because it's a pit.
In the contemporaneous functional mechanisms of our thinking, feeling and behavior - a breakthrough appears.
Here it is good to quote Nietzsche: "He looked so long into the abyss that the abyss looked into him."
The pure feeling - that a person is lost, if all hope disappears, psychologically "die" and a new quality occurs.
And why do I care personally?
I'll answer with a parable.
Once upon a time one fell into a barrel and drowned, running for days, months and years, he kept drowning and reading, and those books taught him to swim - that is, to live.
He became a diver.
I hope that someone will be helped by some sentence written by me, as the texts of Hrabal once helped me.
To what extent do you mean the reader, the specific person who will read your text?
The one about which nothing meaningful can be said, some call it consciousness, another super ego, but in my opinion it was best characterized by Arthur Rimbaud in a letter to a friend:
"I'm someone else - this reader is directly involved in the process of formulating words and sentences."
From an early age, he read the books of old Czech fairy tales, sailed in the submarine of Captain Nema, ran through the Shadowlands in dark alleys.
In the end, after all this branching of the authors and their message, it says: "The sun shines brightly on the worlds of other Karl Hynk Macha".
What if the book is out?
Do you care about the reader’s opinion?
On the feedback that will come to you through the people who read the book?
Of course, I care about the opinion of people who take three hundred crowns and are willing to read five hundred pages of the text.
And then, years later, they accidentally contact me on the street and thank me for helping them with their difficult life decision with my book.
Books are, in fact, "life" or rather "worlds."
They are encoded into characters of letters, they carry experience, the history of the regions of which language.
Any time we can wake them up, we can let their sentences flow into the brain.
It's actually, in a way, something forbidden by God - to awaken other and more life stories, small universes and temporary planets.
It is a fact whose DNA is stored in the lines - according to the old demonological books, we practice witchcraft.
After the publication of the book, you - as it is - are waiting for the chain of author readings.
I remember you used to love to read.
Are you going to do it again with joy, or do you feel it differently after years?
I'd rather just talk like that today.
And what did I find out?
There are good intelligent people everywhere.
Their basic sign - they are inconspicuous, they do not pay much attention to themselves, they have friendly radiation, you do not feel lonely with them.
I will give an example - in the town of <0xC4><0x8C>erven<0xC3><0xBD> Kostelec lived (and I hope that he is still alive) one curly bookkeeper (it is aptly called <0xC4><0x8C>ervenka), a cheerful companion and a good girl bull.
During one piatyka, he introduced me to individual articles of the chain of readers of my book Hou<0xC5><0xA1>tina.
I looked into their eyes and then I was shown a shredded, readable copy of my book.
I put down the just-read morning paper and wept briefly.
We all stood there in silence, swaying and tearing intoxicatingly.
Then the young blond fellow couldn't stand it, and with a shriek he jumped from the window into the snow curtain.
It was on the ground floor.
We ran out into the night landscape and ate the happy fury of the sensibilities, the sick soul of the compatriots and the flock of fallen patriots - howled and waved like werewolves until the morning.
Each of your books is formally and substantively different from the previous ones.
Does this also apply to the text Wind, darkness, presence?
It's a story.
It is a tale of one country behind nine rivers and nine mountains.
Ivan Bunin in his novel Suchodol puts into the mouth of the folk healer the words of an old Russian fairy tale: On the sea, on the ocean, on the island of Bujan.
There's a dog, a grey box on it.
Horror, horror, mystery.
It never happened, but we all know it from somewhere.
Maybe we were devils in hell a long time ago, and we were drawn to what role we're going to play on this earth.
Are you going to keep writing, or are you going to leave it at the free flow of inspiration again?
The answers are eternal - Otokar B<0xC5><0x99>ezina.
Writing is a wonderful way of dialogue.
Something huge and unnameable, like the movement of continents on the planet, affects our desire from such a depth and such a breadth that it completely exceeds our horizon - and so we do with absolute certainty exactly in the intentions of our programmed assignment.
We are rewarded with an influx of dopamine, a mixture of endorphins and other substances.
We are biological machines.
We want to mate, we die defending and acquiring new personal territories.
Sometimes it's a disorder, and we'll shine a light on our compassion.
Only then do we have the right to call people.
That's the answer to your question - the biological robot is already full of various disorders, stands on the shore of the ocean of unconsciousness, and in a perforated sail made of a dirty handkerchief catches the tides of wet wind.
I have to write in order to be human.
Obama withdraws from health care
After a wave of criticism, President Obama stepped back yesterday from his often-repeated and ambitious promise that “if you like your health program, you can keep it.”
Citing hundreds of thousands of statements from Republican service providers in recent days, Republicans have accused the president of misleading the American public.
Yesterday, Obama made a big deal about his original promise.
“The vast majority of people who have working health insurance can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
In light of what he called a “media outburst” about the statements, Obama urged Americans who received those announcements to look for new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to have a better, more comprehensive health care program at the same price or even cheaper than expected.
"You'll get a better offer," he said.
His administration says it shouldn’t be a surprise that 5 percent of the population who have purchased insurance on their own may be forced to change the program because their insurance doesn’t meet the new requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
“I’m saying this to these Americans on a level playing field: you deserve better,” Sebelius said in a statement to the Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the launch of the internet market had been “poor” since October.
"I'm disappointed and angry like everyone else," she said.
I'll try to get your trust back.
Sebelius, agitated, said this sentence, captured by the microphone, yesterday in the direction of the adviser sitting behind her at yesterday's meeting of the Committee, which took place after a stormy exchange of views with Republican Billy Long, a representative from Missouri, who was also involved in the program.
For more than three hours, during a hearing on Sebelius, he repeatedly questioned why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily give up government-sponsored insurance, and did not buy the program through HealthCare.gov, which now enforces millions of Americans.
Which billionaire are you going to call next year?
Kellner, owner of the PPF group, wants to buy the O2 operator.
Both companies have confirmed the negotiations and according to various sources from the agencies and from behind the scenes, the hand is already in the sleeve.
The transaction is expected to be announced in November, probably before the start of the frequency auction for LTE networks, i.e. before November 11.
Kellner's competitor Karel Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rek owns the KKCG group.
Under the brand name Sazka Telecommunications, the company has launched a frequency auction for LTE networks.
To everyone’s surprise, until then, there was no talk of the company’s desire to penetrate telecommunications.
But Sazku is now headed by a very experienced telecommunications masquerader Robert Chv<0xC3><0xA1>tal.
He started as the marketing manager of Radiomobil (today T-Mobile), later became the director of the Slovak T-Mobile, and last time he headed the Austrian branch of the same operator.
The bet plays several cards at once.
She signed up for the auction and now admits that she wants to run a virtual at Vodafone.
And it makes sense.
If it succeeds in the auction, it will be able to move existing customers from its own virtual operator to its network.
This would probably not be liked under normal circumstances by Vodafone, but according to the information of Hospod<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0x99>ské noviny it can be part of a much closer cooperation between the two companies.
Vodafone is currently suffering from a deal between rival operators O2 and T-Mobile, which will fully share their networks.
Vodafone needs a partner.
And that could be Sazka.
If it succeeds in the LTE network tender (as a novice can auction a specially designated spectrum), then Vodafone does not have to enter the auction at all, respectively, it will not mind auctioning only a limited spectrum (there is not enough frequency for all).
Vodafone can share the network with Sazka.
Vodafone will launch Sazku into its 2G/3G network (or the newly built LTE network at 900 MHz, respectively), allowing the company to quickly launch the network.
The bet in between will start to build a costly LTE network, which Vodafone will also be able to use.
Both companies can be satisfied.
The money saved could then be spent by Vodafone on some kind of provider of fixed internet or cable TV.
And Kellner?
The purchase of Czech and Slovak O2 (Slovak branch is the daughter of Czech) would immediately gain a full-fledged operator with still decent profits and a wide range of services.
But on the other hand, it is a big moloch that will await restructuring.
In the auction, the LTE network would have gained Kellner already for O2 and very likely in cooperation with T-Mobile.
Both companies have already declared that they will share the networks.
So the auction could finally end in success, but probably not with the high amounts that the state budget is looking forward to.
And from next year, customers in the Czech Republic could choose between calling with Vodafone, T-Mobile, Kellner or Kom<0xC3><0xA1>rk.
Or two titans of the Czech business against global giants.
Will Czech TV ever be able to do without signing events?
She entered the era of President Zeman's legendary ashtray scene, so it's not hard to hear the complaints that gather evidence of the castle's species being harassed.
In the past, the traditional influence of such Ivan Langer or Jaroslav Tvrd<0xC3><0xAD>k was not documented in this way, let alone signed.
True, the management stopped the editors.
The cases described, however, do not give an answer to the question of where such a propensity of some journalists to the Zemanites comes from - whether it is a reaction to a direct order, or, in order not to use vulgarism, a typical expression of non-local empathic acquiescence.
And when we assume universal impropriety, we cannot forgive the question of whether other, no less unscrupulous, power interests, which have not yet been given the opportunity, seek to change the situation on television.
Those who say that there are no blatant attempts to intervene in the broadcasting of politicians in advanced countries are right.
The truth is, however, that this does not mean that there would be no complaints about public media.
The complainants do not question their independence.
On the contrary, they criticize mainly what they consider to be the tendency that is their own, which is the fruit of their subculture.
Perhaps we have not yet reached this stage of civilization and this situation is not present in our country.
But perhaps also in a country that thinks itself to be the most corrupt in the world, black and white stories of bad politicians and good journalists are more comfortable than more complicated descriptions of an opaque situation in which the behavior of many imperfect human beings is exposed.
JAN JANDOUREK: The curse of this country: presidents on the edge of power
It is almost a rule that, at crucial moments, the head of state was not in such a form as to be able to fulfill his state duties.
If T. Masaryk were physically and mentally five years younger, he would have experienced the end of his presidential term and events around Munich would have taken place a little differently.
We probably would not have won the war, but after the symbolic resistance, the air force could have flown beyond the borders, heavy weapons could have been destroyed, and the government could have fled to London immediately and not fought hard for its legitimacy there.
And most of all, the nation would not have a hangover from that capitulation to this day.
Bene<0xC5><0xA1> was not a statesman and was still in good condition during Munich, but during the war it had already begun to go up the hill with him and in February 48 he behaved accordingly.
Being a little better, he could have gone into exile for the third time and undermined the legitimacy of the Communists and their coups.
It's a shame to talk about H<0xC3><0xA1>ch.
They elected him by saying that "Mr. President will not get into a situation where he would make a decision."
But he had to, although the big decision was probably not made with a knife to the neck at Hitler's in the Chancellery.
The chief of intelligence, Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek Moravec, until the last days of March 1939, said what everything should be done so that the occupation, which he knew exactly for the day, did not take place so smoothly and with such profit to the Germans.
The senile president and the cowardly government did nothing, yet they did not believe him, yet they feared him.
Gottwald had his old comrades executed, as Moscow had instructed him.
Ludv<0xC3><0xAD>k Svoboda was definitely unable to participate in the normalization and they had to put him down, already completely senile.
That Hus<0xC3><0xA1>k was a helpless and sick depressed old man made things easier in November 89, but that's the only point.
Havel was lucky he hadn't been in the office for the last few years, he was spared the worst.
Klaus is still a freshman tennis pensioner, but many of his actions suggest that thought processes are no longer what they used to be.
Now here's what we got.
The head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces look what they look like, and we don't know everything yet.
Fortunately, there is no external threat to the country.
Or maybe she's in danger, just can't be seen.
Then the question is whether it is (historically) not good that the president is not fully in power.
But this is not normal.
Couldn't we elect a president in this country once again, someone who's both acceptable in mind and acceptable in health?
Remote planets, black-and-white films, or a bit of fantasy about extraterrestrial life on earth are not subjects that American jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter would throw up right away.
In the concept of his quartet, which will finish this year’s Struny autumn festival, on November 6th in the large hall of Lucerna in Prague, everything is related to everything.
The score of the quartet of jazz saxophonist Wayne Shorter is the current feelings of musicians.
According to his assignment, two generations of younger colleagues have to play what they are currently experiencing.
They approach music as a completely improvised chamber affair and think not of harmony or rhythm, but of film images.
This principle, however, the newly 80-year-old Shorter - an extraordinary composer, a nine-time Grammy winner, a former co-star of Miles Davis and perhaps today's greatest living jazz saxophonist - does not like to explain.
He doesn’t talk much about music, although his overall view of life is closely related to music.
When I was in my 80s, I thought it was best to let life surprise me.
"Too many people plan everything and then they're disappointed when things go differently," says Shorter.
How the Insects of Thailand Raised the Sales of the Paris Bar
You may sneeze at the insect, but you have no idea that you are eating about half a kilogram of it every year on a completely voluntary basis.
For example, crushed in flour.
If you consume it consciously, then you are definitely trendy: it is ecological, nutritious and you have also taken care of a unique experience.
In early October, Elie Daviron, the chef and owner of the Le Festin Nu bar, put the insect’s offer first on the menu of his business in Paris.
The bar, inspired by William Burroughs’ book Naked Lunch, is located in the fashionable 18th arrondissement near Montmartre.
With fresh avocado, roasted red peppers, ginger and quail eggs, guests here can taste not only various larvae, locusts or water bugs, but also scorpions.
Carefully and specially packaged supplies (so that the insect does not damage the wings, do not twist the legs or damage the eyes) are sent to Daviron from Thailand.
Europe is just learning to eat insects, it is common elsewhere.
The owner of a Parisian bar with a pioneering menu gives several reasons why you should consume insects.
The first of these is the ecological benefit, because the production of insects is much less expensive for our planet (in terms of finance, space and water consumption) than for traditional meat.
"Additionally, insects are an excellent source of protein and omega-3 fatty acids," Daviron told Reuters.
At the same time, the young chef does not deny his profession, he simply aims to offer his customers a unique culinary experience.
According to him, it makes the right restaurant pleasure, a sense of sin and the atmosphere of the environment.
"I'm not saving the world, I'm just mediating a new experience," he explained.
By far not everyone would be thrilled with the idea of how the beetle consumes decorated plague, but the reaction of customers of the Paris bar to the served insects is very positive, according to the owner.
Even skeptics say they finally taste it, even if they start with the smallest ones and eventually choose a scorpion.
The prices of these tasting plates range from five to nine euros.
V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Maty<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1>, President of the Association of Entrepreneurs in Construction in the Czech Republic: New Green Savings Should Continue
Since 2008, the Czech construction industry has been facing a continuous decline in the volume of orders and the lack of interest of the state to address the issue of investment construction.
The announcement of the New Green Savings program was a positive signal for our construction industry, especially for small and medium-sized companies in individual regions.
It is a great opportunity not only for citizens, who after the implementation of the measure will save significant amounts for heating, but also a chance for construction companies and manufacturers of building materials.
Each billion invested will bring more than 2,700 newly created jobs to the state.
From the point of view of the fiscal policy of the state, significant leverage and multiplication effects are also one of the most important growth measures.
The Association of Construction Entrepreneurs in the Czech Republic therefore fundamentally disagrees with the government’s resolution and asks for the implementation of such steps that would allow further continuation of the program so that further challenges can be announced within it.
RIGHT, 1 November 2013
The dog picked up the carpet, the president dug it up and ended up in Berlin.
President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman left the Motol hospital in Prague on Thursday, where he spent the night in bed, and went to the castle in L<0xC3><0xA1>ny.
What health condition is he in?
In an unprecedented admission, John Kerry said U.S. spying “went too far”
John Kerry hinted at a softening of the U.S. defense stance on its surveillance programs, and in an unprecedented admission said that in some cases, espionage “went too far.”
The foreign minister also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for acting as “autopilots” in light of the nasty revelations about the NSA’s spying activities that emerged from whistleblower Edward Snowden.
The news sparked a diplomatic storm between the U.S. government and its allies.
Mr. Kerry, via a video link at an open government conference in London, said: "There is no doubt that the president and I and the others in the government did learn about some things that were done out of persistence, because there was that possibility, referring to World War II, the very difficult times of famine."
He became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. espionage had crossed the border, but stressed that no one’s rights had been violated.
He said, "In some cases, it's gone too far."
And the president is determined to try to explain and clarify this to people, and is already conducting a thorough review so that no one feels that there has been abuse.
I assure you that there is no abuse of the rights of innocent people in this process.
Mr. Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was working for the good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We are facing a new world in which people are willing to fire themselves.”
There is radical extremism in the world that is determined to kill and throw people into the air and attack governments.
And what if you were able to capture it and stop it before it happens?
In fact, we have prevented planes from falling, buildings from being blown up, and people from being executed, because we can already learn about these plans in advance.
The chairman of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs said on Thursday that U.S. lawmakers were preparing to travel to Europe to respond to concerns from abroad about alleged U.S. spying, and convinced Europeans that they needed to continue to join forces in the fight against terrorism.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and that he was concerned about their threat to stop participating in counter-terrorism organizations because they were disappointed with the National Security Agency’s (NSA) surveillance.
"For the national security interests of the United States, it is really important that Europe stays on the same ship with us, given the joint efforts to fight terrorism," Murphy, a member of the Democratic Party and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview with Washington.
And I am heading to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, regardless of their anger at NSA programs.
Reports in the media that the NSA had collected millions of phone records in Europe have disrupted relations with some U.S. allies, even though the head of the agency said this week that they were inaccurate and reflected a lack of understanding of the metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the United States.
Another revelation cited documents revealed by Snowden that the NSA was tracking the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders.
Director of National Intelligence James Clapper defended Allied spying as necessary, saying it was a matter of routine on both sides.
In the midst of the uproar, Murphy said his office is planning a parliamentary trip to be held this year, and hopes that members of both sides and chambers will appear in the delegation.
In the coming days, the names of other legislators who intend to get involved will be published.
He said he was still working on the program.
Although Murphy said the goal of the trip was to help repair the relationship, he added that "well-intentioned educational measures" would also be prepared.
He said European leaders must be honest with their own people about the spying programs they have been using for years.
“While we are adjusting our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, they also need to be aware of the fact that we are not the only ones doing the spying here,” Murphy said.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kerry is heading to the Middle East and Poland as planned this weekend to respond to the hostility already aroused by the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as American surveillance activities.
Australian Woman Appeals Against Staying in Thai Prison
A twenty-one-year-old woman from Sydney, who was sentenced to fifteen days in prison on the island of Phuket when she falsely claimed to have been attacked by a taxi driver, appealed against the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was originally charged by a Phuket court on June 15 with perjury when Thai police said the taxi driver, along with two other men who allegedly detained her, assaulted her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10.
However, a recording from industrial television later revealed that after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend, she returned safely to her hotel.
Phuket Island police held interviews with Bamford for two days before learning that she had invented the incident.
Before the trial, she was held in a local police cell.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in prison in a low-security correctional facility on the outskirts of Phuket, instead of being placed in an adult women's prison.
She is the daughter of former Australian league player Peter Tunks, who in the case of his daughter asked for help from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family had "extreme concerns" about their daughter's fate and wanted her back in Australia.
"Obviously this is a challenging period, but we hope he will return to us safely as soon as possible," Tunks said.
Bamford appealed against the verdict and was released on bail of 50,000 baht.
Reports from Australia indicate that she has meanwhile spent a holiday in the Krabi resort area in southern Thailand.
Thai legal sources say Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket, but she has been warned that the appeal could lead to legal proceedings that would increase her sentence and result in her being placed in an adult prison.
However, after the recent murder of Australian travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, Thailand may also be trying to fix the messy picture for tourists, which may have been behind the liberating verdict.
J<0xC3><0xA1>gr joked: Goal from the break?
In the defensive zone, he got a regiment and no one caught him anymore.
In addition, the escape turned after a quick forehand call.
Jarom<0xC3><0xAD>r J<0xC3><0xA1>gr scored this way against Tampa on Wednesday night, and on Thursday evening the 119th winning goal in the NHL commented on the social network Facebook.
"After watching this video, my agent Petr Svobod was contacted by the director of the Czech Railways and asked if I would be interested in advertising their state-of-the-art Pendolino train!"
They say we are very similar.
I guess I'll have to finish my nightly workouts so I don't have to speed up any more.
"I'm afraid that after that the Minister of Defense could speak and would like to advertise on the jets!" he added with a smile.
In addition, New Jersey scored their second win in a row.
"And most of all, you noticed - the treatment of Maria Rottrov<0xC3><0xA1> takes," concluded J<0xC3><0xA1>gr.
Place of icing candles icing goulash
The October elections, rather than the winners, brought in a bunch of losers.
These are not only the parties that did not even get into the Chamber of Deputies (e.g. SPOZ), but also the previous government parties (ODS, TOP 09) and finally the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD because of its internal split.
Politicians served us a goulash for the weekend instead of a holiday candle.
Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>’s movement became a springboard for elections, promising voters to change the current political style of government.
The fragmentation of the election result and the split in the winning party record the political (because of) President Milo<0xC5><0xA1> Zeman regardless of the wishes of voters who did not even elect the party that President Zeman publicly supported to the Chamber of Deputies.
Although the president lost his strategic lead over other politicians due to the unpleasant event, he still has several ways to get it back - for example, by choosing a future prime minister.
While the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD is moving away from the chance of winning the prime minister’s seat in my eyes, the entrepreneurs are getting closer to Andrej Babi<0xC5><0xA1>.
Although the electoral development is so far miles away from the quick and smooth creation of a stable government, but compared to the pre-election scenario of the left-wing government <0xC4><0x8C>SSD supported by the communists, this development for business in the Czech Republic and therefore the economy is still a better news.
Given the YES’s vocal opposition to joining the ODS or TOP 09, it is still the most likely variant of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, YES and KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL coalition (a total of 111 MPs).
Due to the split in <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which thus became an unreadable and weak partner in the negotiations, the result of coalition negotiations can be quite discouraging for <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The minority government of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD composed of "non-Zemanites" in the Castle will probably not pass.
In addition, any government in which the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD will participate will be threatened by the unsatisfied ambitions of many Social Democrats, which may sooner or later lead to another split in the party.
So I ask myself, "Are we not going to be able to self-destruct into the next early elections?"
The next election would be a referendum on the strength of the electoral mandate of the YES movement.
The plans of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD for the introduction of sectoral taxes, a more significant increase in income taxes or the construction of a state bank have fallen under the table, hopefully.
The parties <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, YES, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL and <0xC3><0x9A>svit, on the other hand, agree, for example, to support business, a rigid fiscal policy (government deficit below 3% of GDP), to support the employment of disadvantaged people, to reduce the lower VAT rate for selected goods.
The frictional areas are most prevalent in terms of social policy and the size of the state.
But YES is now on the top, so the program so far the most likely coalition YES, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, KDU-<0xC4><0x8C>SL would lean rather to the right.
Which, in my view, is ultimately a better result than the left-wing program with taxes on everything that is still moving in the economy.
