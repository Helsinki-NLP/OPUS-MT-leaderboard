The Prague Stock Exchange finished with fewer points at the end of the day
After the rapid fall of the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
<0xC4><0x8C>EZ’s share transactions reached approximately half the value they have on a normal day.
The Prague Stock Exchange, at the beginning of trading Tuesday, reacted immediately to Monday’s fall when it fell to about 6%.
The decline this time is due to the fall in shares on Wall Street.
Also here is the reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the American Assembly of Representatives that refused to support the stabilization plan of the secretary of the financial sector.
Fall in shares in Asia
Shares of the Asian Stock Exchanges experienced a dramatic drop on Tuesday, although over the course of the day the index finally attenuated some of the losses.
Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Stock Exchange’s index throughout its financial day stood at nearly four percent, though it later attenuated its losses by reducing the decline by nearly 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index following the movements of Chinese shares in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange fell by 3.8 percent, in Shanghai the markets were closed.
Shares of the Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than five percent but, in the end, losses fell to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan Stock Exchange, according to the index secretary, fell to 3.6 percent.
“The planned rescue actions in the U.S. are unsafe and this affects the financial market around the world,” said Hong Kong Currency Bureau Chief Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, it alone determines its monetary policy, that is, without dependence on the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong’s interest rates are at the same level as those in the United States.
U.S. lawmakers should reconvene as soon as possible, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, and approve a proposal to support the financial system.
Otherwise, it threatens that the falls will be felt in other countries.
The Bloody Bath of American Stocks
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the aid plan to the financial system to which $700 billion (almost 12 billion crowns) should be devoted.
Legislators thus ignored President George Bush’s invitation to support his plan.
For Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
On Monday, U.S. stocks experienced a bloody dip and mainly the stock index picked up the biggest drop in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell to nearly seven percent, a similar volume drop last recorded in 1987.
The index dropped before it was announced but as soon as it was shown that the proposal of the assembly did not go ahead, the index began to fall freely.
Congress withdraws: U.S. government could inject $700 billion into banking
The highest representatives of Congress and the government, President George W. Bush, agreed on a pact in broad terms of financial aid to the American financial system.
The vote will take place early next week.
U.S. lawmakers caused a rift in talks about approving the bailout plan in its form of aid to the U.S. financial system with the amount of 700 billion dollars (about 12 billion kronor).
However, it is not yet won.
Congressmen need to fine-tune some details of the contract before they can make the final form of the law public and get it voted on.
The financial system assistance plan will be discussed at the Assembly of Representatives on Monday.
Barney Frank, chairman of the Financial Services Committee and the Assembly Bank, told Reuters on Sunday.
According to some sources, the vote on the plan could be held in the Senate not before Wednesday.
According to economists, the arrival of the ratification of the bailout plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for the revitalization of the financial market.
Then, however, "disenchantment" will be achieved thanks to the complex mechanisms whose market support will also reach in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have made a great progress.
We have resolved our conflicting views on how the package of measures for market stabilization should be," Democrat Nancy Pelosi<0xC3><0xA1> told Bloomberg.
According to her, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of lawmakers met Sunday night with Finance Minister Henry Paulson to give a final shape to the government fund.
This should buy from financial corporations the unsold mortgage assets that lead financial firms to heavy losses and threaten the stability of the entire system.
"We are about to close the agreement on the plan, which will work and must also be effective in the market.
It is still necessary to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we are already in it," Paulson said.
A Sign for Asian Business
The global financial crisis has a strong impact on the rapidly declining stock market.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are doing everything possible for Congress to definitively pass a deal on Sunday.
They want to reassure investors in the face of the Asian financial market as these are the ones that are in the first time zone and where Congress could influence Monday’s trade.
However, for now, there is nothing clear with certainty about when the two chambers of the American Congress will vote and, not even, if they will not stagnate at the last moment with some problem.
Lawmakers believe it will be approved in the coming days.
The law, however, will undergo a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be available as soon as possible, as President George Bush requested.
However, Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it has the impression that the program does not fulfill its function, which would be another $100 billion and, later, the last $350 billion.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
On the other hand, the president can veto this decision but Congress can override his veto by a majority vote.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the program was to gain financial resources for the repurchase of bad mortgage securities whose value fell because hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to finish paying their mortgages.
“We’ve worked everything.
The House of Representatives would have to be prepared to vote on the bill on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday,” said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress of the talks.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, announced that Bush is pleased with Saturday’s progress and appreciates “the commitment of both sides to stabilizing our financial market and protecting our economy.”
Limitation of the armored contract
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, head of the negotiators, said lawmakers decided on the responsibility of the program's money for protecting taxpayers' taxes from their losses, a easing close to the planned financial plan.
The new law must also limit so-called armored contracts for directors of the participating companies of the program, and create a committee that will have control of the Fund.
This would have to be directed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We’ve worked very hard on it, and we’ve made a big breakthrough toward a deal that will work and be effective for the market and for all Americans,” Paulson said.
The plan also has to help homeowners who have problems with their payments.
The government would have to agree to new mortgage payments it buys in order to lower the monthly burdens of installment payments from debtors and enable them to stay with their homes.
Marek: psychological help
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be realized but rather difficult.
“And that’s why it’s not known with what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be purchased.
This will be decisive for the distribution of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the server iHNed.cz.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week is not so relevant, according to Marek.
"Much more important is that, already this week, Congressmen agree on their support and give him their good-bye as soon as possible.
This important and psychological agreement to get that approval is, at the moment, the most important thing," Marek insisted.
Armed struggle: the MP3 player against the mobile.
We advise you how to choose
While almost all mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can make calls.
Which seems clear that it is better to buy only the phone.
Still, there are enough reasons for man to acquire only the breeder.
The choice depends practically on the way of its use and the requirement of the future owner.
It will probably be difficult for him to acquire the most modern records to listen to Maxim Turbulenc's latest album on it.
On the other hand, this type of music products such as LPs no longer come out, and in terms of their quality there is not a single objective reason to continue buying them.
If vinyl records with art rock, jazz or blues music are crammed onto your shelves, you’re probably dreaming, at least, of this type of record.
This is the same with the music that is on the way, that is, the music compressed, simplified - the music in MP3.
And here there are categories of price and quality.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend eight thousand crowns on a player, as well as for a Pink Floyd lover who will hardly try out the market helmets of twenty crowns.
Two extremes, between which there is enough space for each.
The choice is wide.
It also decides the duration of the battery
Some of the best players get a lot more than just playing music and even that which not even most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
Faced with the most basic functions such as dialing, sending messages, you can play music and video, record both, have a better or worse camera and even get to navigate.
And when we consider the Smartphone and the PDAs will also have a small computer in your pocket.
This is a small miracle since no refrigerator knows how to make a grill and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobile phones also brings us disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the sooner the display indicator will light up asking to be recharged.
And playing music is one of the greatest energy tragedies.
There are few mobile phones that can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, most of them much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) clearly perform better.
Therefore, keep in mind that cheap mobile phones will not play for more than two hours.
If in addition to this, on top of constantly calling still get, for more safety, a charger for work - this is also valid for the most expensive devices.
With the MP3 player this problem will not have, because even the worst ones can withstand at least 9 hours of uninterrupted operation after a charge.
Another problem occurs when recording music on mobile.
Unfortunately, only a part of the devices has the universal USB connector and, in addition, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course it is possible to record music directly on the memory card but only on some reader units without reduction can the small memory cards that are used on mobiles be connected.
In players, with some exception (iPod), no special software is required.
Simply fill the device with music through the computer's USB.
Most mobile phones and players create their own order in the music library according to the name of the performer, album title, genre or also according to the user rating.
Some devices only show a directory with a tree structure similar to a Windows Finder and some recognize both (river, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
The player tries to serve, the mobile knows more
For the choice of a particular equipment is interested in the resistance of the accumulator, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of sound output and, of course, the comfort of its handling.
If you listen, above all, to music as a background and you will listen to it every day only for a while, as on the tram, then it is enough with any mobile that you play.
This is what virtually any mobile device can achieve.
You should not even be interested in the format in which the mobile or the player plays the music.
The MP3 is played by everyone and almost all the music that comes to it will be in this format.
It is among the most widespread and except for it the absolute majority of the devices play music in WMA format.
The minuses include the AAC format (the format used by Apple and its iPod).
The best mobile phones also make it possible, for example, to buy music online.
Simply through the mobile internet visit the competent pages of the operator (or any other service provider) and buy yourself a song or album.
This service could in itself be a weighty argument for acquiring a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the offer from the operators is miserable and the majority is limited only to the fleeting success issues of the radios.
The prices are not the lowest either.
However, in general, it is assumed that precisely this way of selling music (whether by GSM, internet or wireless internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always carry a cell phone on top of them.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you’ll find the phone in your pocket, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it still depends on whether you always carry headphones or, at least, hands-free ones.
If not, you can use an integrated player that has virtually every mobile even if it is at least an MP3 player.
Probably the biggest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be their price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand.
Between three and four thousand crowns can already acquire a good walkman.
Most of you will be limited by the absence of a classic headphone jack.
The best, even when it comes to the technical part, such as phones equipped with a 3.5 mm input. for classic headphones, cost up to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of the players is nothing more than their easy service.
The simplest players - by no means necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - are really handled by anyone.
The minimal functions, its handling similar to the previous cassettes or also to the turntables is evident.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that by mistake we connect to the Internet with the mobile phone and, consequently, huge account for data loss.
Which device to choose
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. the Vodafone 527) usually have a slot to change the memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of a suitable card will reach two thousand crowns.
However, be careful.
The basic models are usually equipped only with a 2 GB maximum capacity card.
Only the most expensive have a memory of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and still want to buy a cheap MP3 player, take a look at Cowon, Creativ, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (maximum 2 GB) it is not necessary to spend more than 1100 crowns.
If you consider yourself among the most demanding music lovers, get your hands on the most specialized mobile-walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate keys for the MP3 which makes a service as comfortable as that of a single player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose mobiles from the walkman line have almost identical use as that of an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category in terms of price, over four thousand crowns, but with a higher memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery (usually 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the brand most arria brings them MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
It's probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all services as their Western European partners.
However, here we still lack something - the virtual operator, which would force those to be cheaper.
It's probably not gonna be long before we get there.
That Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe, we have already written on mobil.cz.
The rest was also confirmed by the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>TU), which warned that the price of SMS messages in our country is one of the most expensive in the entire Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming rates is likely to come to a paradoxical situation - for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS sending from abroad will be cheaper than if sent from home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, lack of competition that really wants to fight.
This probably seems paradoxical to us, as we have three mobile networks and their high coverage is more than 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators like to complain that there is extreme competition in the Czech market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (<0xC4><0x8C>TU), Pavel Dvo<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>k, has already expressed that there is no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It is perhaps true that for a classical operator with his own network he no longer has too many possibilities (for the rest, it would be quite difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant drop in prices to which the classic operators also had to react.
At the same time, even before the entry of sharks such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile into the UK market, similar voices were heard both here and there.
It has been shown that there is room for this type of operators and that they can succeed.
There is no need to look for examples too far away.
In February this year we informed you about the premiere of the Mobilking virtual operator in Poland.
Only after half a year, this operator managed to gain more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the neighboring country.
On the other hand, behind Mobilking is the Penta group which, apart from that, in the Czech Republic is the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on many more specific target groups.
In addition, in order for them to function effectively, it is enough for them to have far fewer customers than a classic operator.
They do not carry with them relatively large expenses in the construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world this type of virtual operators are usually profiled with low costs - they offer cheap calls and SMS messages that however, are often countered with the offer of more adjusted services.
So, for example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at least half of cheap compared to the competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a good blow to bet on a trivial goal group.
This operator is directed specifically to man.
“The right man chooses Mobilking – it’s the operator he likes and who he can trust,” says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which works with this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say whether similar concept like that of Poland could hook up in our country.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> said: "The Czech market is relatively small to access by segments on which most virtual operators are based.
In addition, from the point of view of the supply of services, it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic there are no possibilities, mobile operators say
However, it seems almost certain that if in the Czech Republic there will be some virtual operator that will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about the expansion of this successful project, however, in the Czech Republic it does not seem too hopeful.
Rather, it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries in our region,” said Jana Studni<0xC4><0x8D>kov<0xC3><0xA1>, spokesman for the financial group Penta.
He indirectly assured that the current mobile operators in the Czech Republic definitely do not bow to this idea.
On the contrary, they try to do everything possible so that no potential competition arises.
Interest in the launch of a virtual mobile operator already shows the GTS Novera group that would like to take a step further to become a real competition of Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2 in the field of business customers.
“We have a great interest in this, in order to be able to offer our customers not only fixed telephony services but also mobile telephony.
And the sooner, the better.
With this possibility we have repeatedly met with all the Czech mobile operators.
With some of them we have been able to move forward in the meetings," said the group's spokesman, Pavel Kaidl.
So, maybe they flash better times.
It seems that, according to unofficial information, the first official operator would probably have to arrive by the end of the year.
But for now its appearance is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
"At the moment we believe that the situation is suitable for the emergence of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Czech market compared to others is a very specific market.
So far no one has addressed us with any complex and serious project in this field," Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>, spokesman for Telef<0xC3><0xB3>nica O2, told mobil.cz.
Other operators refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1>, in exceptional compliance with O2's opinion, adds: "To date we have not registered any viable commercial project that, bilaterally beneficial, can continue to develop."
“On the T-Mobile network it will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
At the moment we should already have on the table some concrete contract that would be possible to study in such a short horizon."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather on meeting the own requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> adds: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, and this in terms of the distribution of costs and infrastructure.
We consider it to be the greatest contribution from the point of view of the customers.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this field lies in the partner with whom to establish a shared network for a fast internet on mobile.”
Responsible offices - with nail and meat operators
The progress of mobile operators can be easily understood, but the entry of another operator would mean increasing competition which would lead to a drop in prices and thereby a drop in profits.
So why facilitate entry into competition?
When traders want to get something, they are able to pull from the same rope, proof of this is the grip when U:fon emerged.
Perhaps the greatest pressure on <0xC4><0x8C>TU was at the time of the entry of U:fon by the T-Mobile company.
This is attested by the public information available on the <0xC4><0x8C>TU website.
But right now U:fon serves as an argument for why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> adds: “Furthermore, it was not long ago that the competitive environment in the mobile phone market was opened to a fourth operator.
As for the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player into the market would mean great requirements for him and, above all, for his services."
This is why this access to mobile operators is tremendously discouraging due to the absolute disinterest of the Czech regulatory body.
This is not just the position of the <0xC4><0x8C>TU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in trade tenders, unlike Great Britain and other developed countries.
This belongs purely to the Office for the Protection of Commercial Tenders (<0xC3><0x9A>OHS).
However, it expressed its typical stance on this issue.
“The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile phone market would be possible after an agreement on the rental of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile phone operator and a virtual operator was concluded.
So far no agreement has been closed as the supply of potential interested parties was rather not interesting enough for the classical operators,” added Kristian Chalupa, of the Department of Foreign Affairs of the UOHS.
These statements do not surprise the representatives of the operators.
For the offices that must represent the interests of consumers, this is more than a consideration, apart from that they should note that no one takes advantage of their position in the market.
Especially when Kristi<0xC3><0xA1>n Chalupa adds: "Overseas where virtual operators operate normally we can observe that their entry into the market contributed to the drop in prices of mobile phone services"
Obviously, the pressure as to the proper functioning of the market media and the fall in prices do not fall within the interest of the OHIM.
The really dramatically shocking thing in all this is the dissonant reactions that result from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is a coincidence, is offered on its own.
It is the same as with the price of gasoline in gas stations because it is clear that it is a work of chance and of a hard struggle for competition.
"The Office has found no signs of unfair competition in this regard and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position therefore do not have a corresponding rise in responsibility in their actions in the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile phone market to virtual operators, rather, are missing, as well as telecommunications regulators," Chalupa added to his response.
The interpretation about the dominant position in the market is one of the many conflicting points.
There is clearly an analysis of relevant markets developed by the <0xC4><0x8C>TU according to which telecommunications are from the point of view of the commercial tender a single market.
In this type of market of course none of the Czech operators has a dominant position.
However, some of the legal experts offer another vision - for a virtual operator to emerge it is always necessary to agree with the network administrator.
And the mobile operator - with all its logic - has the monopoly of its network.
Therefore, in a particular segment it must necessarily be dominant.
And if this argument is not accepted, at least for UOHS it should be a warning that three mobile operators rise strikingly in a similar way.
The current complaints of the interested parties (including the aforementioned GTS Novera company) show that in all negotiations with the operators there are many similar impediments.
Charge of responsibility in the <0xC4><0x8C>TU is a fairly common trick in the field of telecommunications from which the OHS is washing its hands in all this matter.
We have met with him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, a new amendment to the telecommunications law was recently introduced for the expansion of <0xC4><0x8C>TU’s competition in the field of commercial tenders that was not carried out, even though a number of specialists promised that the situation would improve.
Representatives of UOHS should know this perfectly, but it is obvious that their interests lie elsewhere.
Everything's fine, when no one's looking
At the same time, unobtrusively something like a pseudo-virtual operator still works that in the Czech mobile networks already exist a few.
They are companies that put their own prices on mobile phone services which, however, only a part are public.
Usually these are companies that are engaged in multi-level marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Usually only a select few get the price list of these companies.
The magic is that the company, with respect to the operator, acts as a classic business customer of the same ordering a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer you will then receive special prices and other offers.
The problem is that commercial conditions in all Czech mobile operators prohibit this type of resale.
"If cases like the ones you cite were discovered, you could talk about a breach in the contract conditions that could translate into the end of collaboration with the given society," Martina Kemrov<0xC3><0xA1> answered the question about this problem.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity carried out by mobile operators would reach responsible people.
It is precisely in the case of the three companies mentioned that they can reach thousands of customers.
None of the operators are against this procedure.
With the activities of these companies they get a negligible profit and at the same time - unlike the real virtual operators - in no way threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav <0xC4><0x8C>epick<0xC3><0xBD> warns us of possible problems: "The law allows such speculation, however, the services of this company are used only by a negligible so many percent of customers.
They also have to accept that their phone’s SIM card is not in their name so they can’t absolutely dispose of it as a normal carrier customer.”
This is exactly what should seem to the <0xC4><0x8C>TU at least strange.
There is also a new question for the UOHS.
If mobile operators surround their eyes in this type of procedure, why do they block the virtual operator’s entry?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has enough competence to discover this type of activity and if it is not going to want it should not be satisfied with the explanations of the operators that they have no idea of this history and that their commercial conditions do not allow it.
When will we stop being the most expensive
As was already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator into the mobile phone market brought a significant decrease in the prices of services.
At the same time, in practically all the countries where the virtual operator emerged, the classical operators tried more or less to protect themselves from this intrusion.
The arguments used by these were virtually all identical - too small, a market, eventually, too saturated, problems with the quality of service, etc.
In the most advanced countries, however, regulatory bodies have now intervened and in none of the cases did they defend the operators but their customers.
Whether with formal measures or informal pressure they managed to create the first virtual operator and with it began to emerge more.
Unfortunately, the Czech Regulatory Authority all this happens as if it were a burning nail.
From our experience we cannot fail to be impressed that the confusion of the attributions in these cases suits them.
But let's not despair.
If this behind-the-scenes information is correct and the virtual operator actually gets to these lands, then the Czech mobile phone market is likely to start moving again.
If one of the operators lets a virtual mobile operator in, it will be difficult for the OHS to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested parties.
And we may stop calling more expensive than in the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the official Czech anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek presented the new official recording of the anthem Where, My Home.
The new anthem was recorded by the National Theatre orchestra under the direction of Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek.
There are four versions available - two versions that are Solos, one male voice and one female voice, one with Chorus and another instrumental.
Del canto will take care of Kate<0xC5><0x99>ina Kn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>nkov<0xC3><0xA1> and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the arrangements of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiah and Jaroslav Kr<0xC4><0x8D>ek.
On the server iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
B<0xC4><0x9B>lohl<0xC3><0xA1>vek considers this Czech national song as one of the most beautiful hymns.
Czech Radio has previously said that it intentionally chose for Solo singers with representatively young voices that are more expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried with the two and then, also, with the choir to be fixed in the diction so that the text was well understood, so that it had a consonance," he said.
The official Czech anthem celebrates its 175th anniversary next year.
The song Where, My Home first sounded in 1834 on the tables of the State Theatre in the original Czech work Fidlova<0xC4><0x8D>ka by Josef Kajet<0xC3><0xA1>n Tyl and arranged with the music of Franti<0xC5><0xA1>ek <0xC5><0xA0>kroup.
It gained popularity and people made it their own.
The first stanza of the song after the emergence of Czechoslovakia in 1918 became, naturally, a part of the official anthem.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the emergence of the independent Czech Republic.
How the "new" anthem sounds
The MHD of Prague takes us on Wednesday for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, October 1, 2008, the history of the Prague Transport Company is written the date when the first passengers enter the metro, tram and bus with an electronic voucher in their pockets instead of a paper ticket.
This can be purchased right now by almost one hundred thousand people who own the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day, 90-day and annual voucher (this will be valid from January 1, 2009) and simultaneously load it onto their chip card at the transport company’s info centers and stations at the Metro, Muzeum, M<0xC5><0xAF>stek, N<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD> Hole<0xC5><0xA1>ovice, And<0xC4><0x9B>l, Roztyly, Let<0xC5><0x88>aby, Raty<0xC5><0x88>any, and Raty<0xC5><0x88>any.
The bonds can be bought from yesterday on the internet on the pages of the transport company, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the afternoon, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those who start using the internet as a form of commerce can definitely start to forget about ticket booths at subway stations, where until now they had to regularly queue to get a normal ticket.
The voucher is purchased online, and the Opencard card is recharged at one of the thirteen branches of the Municipal Library.
“In these places, there is a ready-made staffed window available to passengers that helps those interested with online shopping and also with recharging the voucher purchased on their card,” said project spokesman Martin Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD>.
Apart from the library, it will also be possible to recharge the electronic voucher on the Opencard in vending machines located in some of the metro’s lobby areas.
How are these vending machines?
They are red, remind us of a ticket cutting machine and travelers will probably have already looked at them at the metro stations of Roztyly, Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovick<0xC3><0xA1>, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavsk<0xC3><0xA1>.
"There are now five in the city but by the end of the year there would have to be eighty," Opatrn<0xC3><0xBD> said.
The bonus is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
Simply enter the Opencard chip card on it and the previously paid bonus will be charged only on it.
Electronic bonds from tomorrow are valid not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in commuter trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that mainly use the inhabitants of the localities of central Bohemia.
"On the trains attached to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviewers equipped with a reading card that will help confirm the validity of the time and the zone of the bonus," explained the control of the tickets, Filip Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal of the organization Ropid that establishes the schedules of the collective transport of Prague.
Circumvalation buses have their reader cards mounted in the driver's locker.
When entering it is necessary not only to show the card to the driver but also it is necessary to accompany it with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the Box.
With this, the driver controls the validity of the bonus.
“If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the bonds there is nothing easier than requesting this information from the driver,” Dr<0xC3><0xA1>pal added.
Passengers who do not travel on the tour buses and do not remember when the voucher expires can go to the vending machines where the cards are recharged.
Here, on the machine screen, you will be shown information about the validity of your document.
The South-Easters wanted to be part of the US in a referendum
The German Sudetenland demanded in 1945 that Fumaba be part of the United States.
This is what is extracted from the letter that is kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to at least live under the patronage of the United States of America.
With this desire, presumably, some groups of Sudeten Germans addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
It results from the letters that are kept in a particular archive and that are now kept in the collection of the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of <0xC4><0x8C>esk<0xC3><0xBD> Krumlov ask in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "land <0xC5><0xA0>umava" - occupied by Hitler on the basis of the Munich Pact - back to Czechoslovakia.
“We have correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that American units are coming to German lands not as oppressors or enemies but as liberators,” the letter reads, signed with a “people who carry the fate of <0xC5><0xA0>umava in their hearts.”
In view of the fact that the union of Czechoslovakia with the southeastern Germans presumably supposes - according to these the Czech national character - a hope only in brutality, disregard, misunderstanding, pressure and slavery, the authors ask in the letter to the American president who assumes today and forever <0xC5><0xA0>umava under a protectorate.
“We cannot believe that, without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, it will hand us over to a foreign state that oppresses and rejects minorities and that at all collaborates with the victory of the allies,” the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign is presumably the fear of reprisals from the "Czech oppressors".
If the U.S. president presumably doubted this idea of the <0xC5><0xA0>umava Germans, it would be enough to organize a referendum in the <0xC5><0xA0>umava lands on whether its inhabitants want to be part of the U.S. or live under their patronage.
Although the text of the letter, with the current knowledge of post-war history, may sound a little childish, according to some specialists paints neatly the expectations of the Germans of the southeastern then.
Although the Czech Germans had to minimally intuit that it was going to be about their expulsion from the republic only a few admitted this possibility.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some clear form of autonomy for the Sudetenland.
Others thought they would stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed even by the Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice.
This was in the war, like Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice's German, enlisted in the Baltic Navy.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the Holstein prisoner camp, dozens of Germans came to him to teach them Czech.
“They thought that when they came home, the Czech would be fine,” Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Czechoslovakia, according to him, had that on the basis of the Decrees of Goods they would be removed from the Republic.
Don't think - you pay!
Emotional Campaign Attacks Drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
In this way, the emotional Campaign that decided to launch the Ministry of Transport in the media on Wednesday could be characterized.
The minister's office, Ale<0xC5><0xA1> <0xC5><0x98>eb<0xC3><0xAD><0xC4><0x8D>ek, promises to deter drivers from dangerous driving.
The campaign of 150 million will be heard on television, radio, cinema, internet and in brochures.
I would have to dissuade the driver from high speed and from driving alcohol.
And also to remind them that before getting started, they tie the belts.
It wants to raise awareness above all of young drivers, drivers, pedestrians and last but not least of professional drivers.
And what can we see in the ads?
Fundamentally human stories that embitter emotions.
And for this we are attested to by the "bloody" announcements throughout the campaign:
Don't think - you pay!
The word "Don't think" is written in capital letters on the license plate.
And in a pool of blood is the word "pays."
This must symbolize that man at a moment of misdirection can come to pay with his own life.
The ads will "fear" viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by the campaign in Anglo-Saxon lands where strong images of accident victims can be seen.
It promises to reduce accidents and the number of deaths on Czech roads.
The announcements have been prepared by the agency Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip for drivers
“For drivers, the sugar and whip system is worth it.
Sugar is for him when, for example, a traffic light is passed in red and thus saves time.
The whip is a threat of fine or accident.
Drivers should be reminded of the risks,” says Na Homolce hospital transport psychologist Martin Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n.
And that is why an information campaign is necessary in the press and mainly a negative advertising, concrete the psychologist.
Less effective, for him, are the panels that warn the driver of dangers.
"If there is any panel installed warning of any danger it will probably soon merge with the environment and the driver will not pay more attention to it," Ko<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xA1>n warned.
Olmert would return almost all occupied areas in exchange for peace
Israel’s interim government president, Ehud Olmert, ruled on the restitution of virtually all occupied land in 1967, namely the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with Palestine and Syria.
He proposed in the interview that Monday appeared in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.
“We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians which means that we will necessarily have to return almost all (occupied) land if not all,” Olmert told the newspaper.
“We’ll certainly be left with a percentage of these lands, but we’ll have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage [of the land of Israel] because without this there will be no peace,” he added.
He admitted that in case of restitution, Jerusalem would also be included.
"He who wants security in Jerusalem and therefore does not want the tractors or excavators to pass over his legs as happened to one of my best friends, then he will have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert said in reference to the two July attacks in the city in which several people were killed and dozens wounded.
According to the president, it will be necessary to find "a special solution to the Temple hill, a sacred and historic place" that is located inside the ancient city.
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work,” he insisted later.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke of Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which in his view is an inherent condition for concluding a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also involve concrete efforts on the part of Damascus.
"I do not propose to close the peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal of the Golan," he warned.
“The Syrians know very well what they will have to break away from in order to win the Golan.
They will have to abandon their current relations with Iran, they will have to abandon their relations with Hizbullah (the Shiite movement), they will have to break away from the ongoing support for terrorism from Hamas (the Shiite movement), Al Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq.”
Post-Accident Questions: Are Hostages on Buses Illegal?
The law is unknown, you can't walk on a long-distance bus
In connection with the tragic accident of the bus of the company Student Agency near the Italian city of Padua, we are asked if the hostesses and passengers can move by the bus during the trip.
“If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the activity of the hostess is opposed to the traffic law,” said Karel Hanzelka, spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident in which the 22-year-old hostess died last week was evidently caused by the truck driver only that the bus crossed into the road.
The girl, unfortunately, was sitting next to the driver in the least safe place of the vehicle despite having booked two other seats.
However, the bus can have an accident or brake suddenly, and at the exact moment the host delivers the coffee or newspapers.
Here what plays the role is if the bus is equipped, according to the technical permission, with places on foot.
If the bus is not approved, the passenger must be seated.
The long-distance buses of Student Agency have no places to go on foot, which was confirmed by the director of the company, Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, to Aktu<0xC3><0xA1>ln<0xC4><0x9B>.cz.
"We have solved this with the ministry and, in principle, the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally this was removed and we came to the agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom while the bus is on if they have a seat," he said.
The hostess does not know the law
"There is no obvious legal interpretation of the role of the host - no legal provision clarifies this function.
Not even any legal provision prohibits transport agents from performing any service.
The law on road transport only knows the term Vehicle Reviewer, whose rights and obligations are not defined,” adds spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorn<0xC3><0xBD>, on the contrary, thinks that the law sufficiently addresses this problem.
“It depends on whether the bus has the approval allowed to have footholds.
That's all," he says.
Buses are divided among urban ones, where there are places to stand and of limited maximum speed, inter-urban ones with places to stand with a higher speed permit and those with long distances without places to stand, with the higher speed permit and with seats equipped with seat belts.
As in the plane, says the expert
BESIP’s expert on Transportation Safety, Jaroslav Ho<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>n, sees no major problems with the movement of the host on the bus.
“During the development of the trip there is not much threat of danger, the situation can be compared with the service on the planes.
Not even here is the certainty that the turbulence will come and that the hostess can be hit in the head."
“However, if the bus suddenly brakes obviously physical laws are valid.
Same as on a city bus or on a tram.
The safety of the host must be solved by the carrier’s internal regulations,” he says and also thinks that from the point of view of the law this problem is unsolved.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura is ready to cancel this service
Student Agency is the only carrier offering the host service.
It employs two hundred.
The director, even after the accident, considers that work risky.
“However, the moment you get the impression that the position of host is risky, then I will remove it.
The coffee and newspapers can receive it, the passengers, upon entering.
It would even save costs,” he says.
In the interest of safety is the reason why Asiana lacks hostesses in her vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, who runs a small line compared to SA.
“We don’t have hostesses, we are against them from the beginning.
Sooner or later this will end in a fatal accident," he told T<0xC3><0xBD>den.cz less than a year ago.
There was a huge tragedy
In the accident of the line connecting Naples died a young stewardess of Pilsen who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovene truck that probably turned from the parking lane blocking the way to the bus.
His driver tried in a quick maneuver to avoid it, however, he collided with the right front.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura denies that the two sites that are reserved for the rest of the hostess were sold.
"These sites cannot be reserved for long-distance connections, they are blocked."
The company intends to sue the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the verdict of the trial on the compensation of the girl's family but expects the financial expenses also on the part of the culprit.
Reform of the law?
No, for now
The reform of the law could bring greater precision about the movement of the hostess on the bus on which for a year now thirty expert members of a group of the Ministry of Transport are working.
“However, no concrete conclusion has been reached.
They don’t focus too much on buses, but rather on the points system, maximum speed on motorways and the use of mobile phones during walking,” says expert Hor<0xC3><0xAD>n.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the host women to be a significant threat to the safety of passengers,” Hanzelka said, adding that the control of safety on buses is the responsibility of the police and the Office of Safety at Work.
D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf’s hope rests on Frankfurt
The letter from the board of directors of West LB Bank to its collaborators does not lack big words.
By merging the units of the bank of Dusseldorf with the bank DEKA, it is possible to form <0x60>a central capital market of the financial group of Sparkassen', as the paper says, published on Monday.
The West LB bank, breaking the “competition block” with sustainable profit potential, would enter such a business.
In addition, such a merger may be a start for further mergers in the area of regional banks.
This is how the text comes to understand, when a board of directors wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because as before, the West LB is under enormous pressure.
Not only on the part of the European Union, but also on the part of the Federal Institute for Financial Services Surveillance, which has recently made clear to the North Rhine-Westphalian government that there is little time left to find a solution.
For a long time, also on the part of Frankfurt, there has been much talk about the union of this type between the bank DEKA, which Sparkasse’s clients are known for their investment funds, and the West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, the head of the DEKA bank, presenting the data after half a year at the end of August, said that he does not see any sense in the merger of the bank, located on Mainzer Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, with a regional bank such as Helaba or West LB.
But the board of directors of DEKA, which is now made up of regional banks and Sparkassen associations, instructed the board to start negotiations with West LB on common business activities.
This could be a business in the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, the negotiations have just begun, so it is said on the financial site.
It is not the first time when it comes to consolidation in the field of Sparkassen appears the name of the bank DEKA that with its 3000 employees is among the most important entrepreneurs on the financial site Frankfurt.
In 2003 the situation at one time seemed so that the DEKA bank could merge with the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank and with the Helaba.
This initiative to create a union of three parties was unsuccessful.
As soon as the plans were made public, the Hesse government spoke out against Helaba’s participation in this project.
The other two banks also did not find the same language.
Instead, the Rhineland-Palatinate regional bank began the dialogue with the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg regional bank.
But it was always played back with the idea of merging the DEKA bank with other regional banks.
But finally, G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Merl, the chairman of the board of directors of Helaba, said he was against the plans for coexistence with his bank.
Independently of that, it seems to be clearer that the union of the different banks in the field of public law is necessary.
Well, when the Bavarian parliamentary elections are to pass, the union of BayernLB with the regional bank of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg could make progress.
For the Helaba that is not necessarily good news.
If the pressure continues to merge will increase, Helaba will lack the partners to do that.
In the south the bank could only be a young partner, although so far it excelled much better from the financial crisis than did the buildings of Stuttgart and Munich.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen- und Giroverband of Hesse-Turingia, which owns 85 percent of the Helaba, earlier this year avoided plans for coexistence with the West LB.
In any case, only the Nord LB remains.
But such geostrategic reflections form are only a part.
On the other hand, it is about the compatibility of the different banking models.
In June, Merl asked a fundamental question about a business model that could guarantee the future for regional banks, to which the German Sparkassen- und Giro-Verband has so far given no answer.
In the end you can break down the West LB, but that, of course, is not the bank’s own desire.
Thus, also in the letter of the board of directors of the bank it is said that an attempt would be made to find a complete solution for the whole bank.
As you can combine the co-existence between singular parts of the bank with the DEKA, that’s going to show time.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the “Italian Weekend”.
For Elena it is the first time, for Luca it is the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena attends him as his girlfriend, and so everything seems different, he says.
Behind them, next to a 5 liter barrel of Kaiser-branded beer is built a huge bear tiger that shows almost 200 Oktoberfest participants that low sounds can produce in their throats.
First Elena gives Luca a pat, then a kiss.
From Bologna they came to Verona.
From there, from the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova train station, tonight at 23:45 there are three buses, <0x60>towards Munich, the beer party', expected to arrive at 6:30 in the morning.
Three buses are mainly intended for Italians, one bus is only for Brazilians.
In one of the corners of the parking lot next to their flag are singing South Americans, they had already started to party at night.
With a lot of noise, says Marco Guarda, which is nothing for the Italians.
Marco, who wears a long coat with an artificial leather lining and silver-colored glasses, owns these buses.
Since five years they come to the Oktoberfest, taking into account that only this year there are three excursions.
At night on the way there, during the day in the meadow, at 22.30 the turn.
Spending the night there means only unnecessary expenses, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros, including the reception of the welcome with a Kaiser beer that was made according to the law of purity of Bavaria, health insurance and the guide in German – Marco attended a language course in Frankfurt.
At night the buses are already on the way on the highway with the direction "Brennero"
No beer, not yet.
Quickly tranquility reigns in the bus, travelers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the forces.
It stops at Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian registration make another break on Highway 8 just before Munich.
Finally, when Marco’s group has the scheduled arrival at 6.30 in the parking lot next to the Prado de Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has his last speech on how to proceed.
First, put on a yellow hat.
There, on the left side is written "Oktoberfest", next to it in Gothic lettering is the page of Marco's travel office on the internet: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the tent of the campaign are opened, that means to march!" cries Marco in the early morning.
"Walk!" Walk and occupy the back seats in the campaign tent.
"Don't take the places ahead, because we're going to block, and everyone with yellow caps doesn't sit on the same bench, spread all over the space!"
A liter of beer, pray Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget the tip
Show the security people that we have a good tone!
As soon as he leaves his place, he will be occupied!"
Third: "This afternoon exactly at ten and a half you have to get here!" Do you understand?
And now everyone goes to the Oktoberfest.
One, to mark the way, ties the yellow caps on the trees, traffic signs and even on a poster of the elections of a large Bavarian People’s Party.
We want to be able to recognize the way back.
It is the second weekend of Oktoberfest which is known as "the Italians' weekend"
There is no exact data on the number of people; these are 50,000 people who make the trip over the Alps and stormily enter the tents, 10 percent of all came especially this weekend from Italy.
The Munich police receive help from seven police officers from the Autonomous Province of Bolzano, Italian volunteers help the Bavarian Red Cross that makes a statistic of the present nations, where the Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, in front of the English (about 60 assistance) and Austrians occupy the first place.
The favorite shop of the Italian campaign is called Hofbr<0xC3><0xA4>uzelt.
The Sleepless Nights for Hypo Real Estate Creditors
Germany’s banking system is relatively stable, Federal Finance Minister Peter Steinbr<0xC3><0xBC>ck stressed just last week.
Well, the politician used the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sector will also be affected by critical trends.
And that happened after the weekend.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), the real estate financier of Munich, which is listed on the DAX index, receives from a consortium of German banks a credit of 1 billion to be able to resist market turbulence.
On Monday, a person who knows the situation very well told Reuters: credit assistance amounted to 35 billion euros.
The portion of the capital that the Hypo Real Estate is going to use has to throw interest.
Money comes from private banks as well as from public law banks.
The cause of this is the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to one report, state financiers with the money that was borrowed for long-term projects financed them only for a short period – which now, due to mistrust in the markets, is no longer possible.
In the first half of the year the bank's cash capital reserve has fallen by 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, also the share of equity delayed slightly by 1.6 percent to 1.45 percent.
Compared to the same period last year, continued financial investment income and net financial operating profit fell to zero, imputation income for debtors and some securities also those of the dissolution of provisions of credit businesses tended to fall by more than 70 percent, by 5 million euros.
Only thanks to the high and high revenues from the compensation expenses of the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the federal tax code and the businesses organized for the consortium companies, the negative balance could charge a deficit of approximately 16 percent more.
After its privatization in 1990 the former state financier was initially lost in speculation with industrial loans for real estate, which served as reason for the foundation of the Aareal bank.
As it was not possible to make much money from the financing of state projects, Defa began to devote intensively to projects in the field of infrastructure and the financing of community projects by private and state investors (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and diversified.
Now the Hypo Real Estate has to make amortizations on the value of the subsidiary that will have a "essential material effect" on the consolidated account of losses and profits of the group, it is said very inaccurately.
It is a fact that dividends have been cancelled.
By 2007, they had already been cancelled by two-thirds.
After the acquisition of Depfa the Hypo Real Estate became a major state and financial financier in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not own the client deposits, it, compared to other banks, turns out to be more dependent on refinancing in the interbank market.
With the bankruptcy of the U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers, which happened two weeks ago, the granting of interbank loans went down essentially because the banks were saving their liquidity.
Every year the Hypo Real Estate needs almost 50 billion euros to finance a portion of Defa’s credit portfolios from its short-term measures for refinancing.
According to the Hypo Real Estate report, the bank covers with a credit the need for the financing of the group for a short time and the company is assured of "the influence of international money markets that are now essentially unfit to operate"
Other sources say that thanks to this money, refinancing is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, the chairman of the board of directors of Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not need the money markets for the foreseeable time.
The German central bank and the Federal Institute for Financial Services Surveillance (BaFin) start from the basis that the competitiveness of the Hypo Real Estate Group from now on is assured.
That’s what the bank’s shareholders and creditors have to expect.
But because of the dynamics and imponderability of the crisis there is no constancy.
It’s even conceivable that you won’t need the funding in its full volume.
But the opposite case cannot be ruled out.
There was a rumor that in the last hour of Sunday the bank was still almost insolvent, so temporary salvation can not reassure at least concerned people.
The share price fell to 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
Borrowing courses, on the other hand, are really good.
While the priority debts almost do not change, the borrowing rates according to the position on the property register clearly tend to decline.
Loans from the former W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg Hypo subsidiary are mainly affected, and loans whose maturities exceed 2009.
After the remarkable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of Depfa that affected the Hypo Real Estate, the current value of its loans that were previously an investment for speculation must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While issuing banks, governments and banks that are little affected are still ready to support the system, in the meantime you can start from pension amortization within the deadline.
Or something is going to happen, which no one dares to imagine – the financial crisis will overcome in the next 15 months.
But by seeing the cross-news about partial statization, now the security that is already at its limit has become a justified hope.
That’s going to be a reason, because creditors will spend the nights without sleep, breaking their heads over the decision about their isolation from enthusiasm.
Short-term investors can still put an end to and use the new-account transportation of losses for future pay-as-you-go tax benefits on the change in the future.
Sylvana and the Secrets of Bent?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, a 16-year-old girl, had to show up at Tachibana High School the girls started to laugh: The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word Mangas - in a report on exchanges she tells Japan.
"The first day at a school in Japan.
I felt nervous.
Before I went to school, I was scared.
I live on the edge of Tokyo in the direction of Kawasaki and I go by train 40 minutes to Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way alone, fortunately I didn’t get lost.
It seems that the beginning of classes is not fixed as rigorously as in my home, in Lower Saxony.
From eight in the morning the students come, at nine minus twenty begins a small meeting with the teachers, the 'home room'.
Before the class started, I had to introduce myself.
I am also not a person who likes to talk in public, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
As they still have the school uniform I put on an old skirt of the mother of my host family and also a blouse, blue socks and black leather shoes.
Well, so dressed I put myself in the pulpit and tried to pronounce everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo she Sylvana..." - my name is Sylvana, I am from Germany and in a week it will be my birthday.
At this time I was very happy because I had already started to study this language for two years.
All 31 girls in the class have poked, laughed and made signs and all the time I've heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her from my sleeves.
That belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "mona, linda"
Then I quickly slipped into my place.
The girl next door had a big smile, for her it was an honor that the exchange girl had to sit next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I felt really assaulted.
Everyone spoke at the same time, laughed and asked a lot of questions – at the same time it is very difficult to understand English from Japanese.
Then in the recess they all took out their Blessings.
The mother of my host family also made a Lanchbox for me - it's something else than boring pieces of German bread.
He had rice with herbs, small sausages, cucumber and seaweed salad, fruit and something like tofu meat.
In most cases I have no idea what like here in Japan.
Things are rare and they have a new taste.
What is certain is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of pickled plums in the salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools, bontos are not just a lunch.
Sometimes it happens that a girl prepares a blessing made in a very artistic way for a boy and gives it to him in the hope of getting to know him better during a recess.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I’m curious to see if I can see it here too.
“Why Japan?” my friends asked me when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend a year of school.
Then he always replied:
"Well, because it fascinates me."
I’ve been reading manga for years.
In order to better understand comics and culture, one day I started to study a little Japanese.
For me it was absolutely certain that one day I would travel there.
Also because I have a weakness for tradition and customs.
Here they have great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other hand, it is a strict, disciplined and traditional country.
As everything is well organized, I still didn’t feel lost here even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Rats also have feelings.
It is said that a rat or a cockroach feeling the danger flees, why are you also afraid?
Joseph Le Doux, the neuroscientist, is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can it be controlled if they, behaving in a manner similar to us, feel the same?
In an Internet magazine called "Edge" for many years the contributions of famous scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series the answers chosen to the question What do you think is truth without being able to prove it?
I think animals have sensations and other states of consciousness without me or anyone else being able to prove it until now, although we can’t even prove that other people are conscious.
But in this case we can at least expect it because all human brains have the same fundamental configuration.
But as soon as we dedicate ourselves to other species and include questions about sensation and in general about consciousness, we enter the unknown realm because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is in danger, it does the same as other animals: it becomes dead, flees or attacks.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists draw conclusions about comparable subjective experience.
Of course I don't think so.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to spread our subjective experience to that of animals.
First, they almost always include the circuits associated by the human consciousness of the lateral prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex (because of their involvement in short memory and executive functions that direct behavior).
This broad part is much more developed in the case of humans than that of other primates and seems to be absolutely lacking in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects related to our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex, including knowledge about who we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to assume that even man is different from other primates.
Another peculiarity is found in the linguistic nature of man: Since most of his experience is united with language, it often means that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
But even if consciousness did not depend on language, it would influence it so that the consciousness of animals, created anyway, would in many cases be different from most of our states of consciousness.
Therefore, it is difficult to explain how the consciousness of other animals works.
If that, as something interesting and subjective, is not measured because it has special hardware, nor is it analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us with great problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of conscious experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of consciousness that should be easier for scientific research.
One could investigate the consciousness processes of animals without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during the studies of short-term memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed by Christof Koch and Francis Crick the essential passes rather to the neutral correlates of consciousness than to the causal mechanisms: The two may or may not be alike.
Interestingly, this approach highlights the importance of the prefrontal lobe of the cerebral cortex for visualization formation.
And what does that mean for sensations?
I owe it to the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain is activated that is responsible for that, the same thing that happens with fear.
What we describe as fear is therefore a state of mind in which we are when the activity of the brain occupies a space of the defense system (or its consequences such as the reactions of the body).
From this point of view the sensations are very fixed apart from the cerebral cortex which distinguishes primates and especially man.
From the point of view of linguistic nature, classifications of fine sensations follow because we can differentiate and classify states with the help of words and grammar to be able to describe the states of others alongside ourselves.
For example, Antonio Damasco, on the other hand, thinks that the sensations are derived from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral cortex responsible for bodily feelings and the brain stem, Jaak Pankseep thinks the same, but focuses more on the brain stem.
Since this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can refer to absolutely different types and their sensations.
For theoretical reasons I cannot go against that, but I consider it unlikely.
Pakseep argues that what rats and men feel as fear, possibly that feels in two cases as well: But how can you control if rats and men behaving in a similar way feel the same?
Seeing the danger a cockroach flees, because he is afraid?
I am of the opinion that the similarity of behavior does not yet prove the similarity of experience.
That’s true, the neural comparison helps: rats and men have similar brainstems, cockroaches on the contrary don’t have at least one brain.
Is the brain stem responsible for sensations?
Even if it is possible to test it for men: How can you test it in case of rats?
I think rats and other mammals, possibly also cockroaches (who knows?), have sensations.
But I don't know how you can prove it.
I prefer to investigate emotional behavior of rats than emotional sensations because their sensations are supposedly fundamentally distinct from us (because human consciousness refers to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the field of neurology is expected here as long as the same is measured in rats and men.
Since I don’t research the language and consciousness of rats, as well as sensations, I don’t know if they exist.
It can be said that I do not see beyond my nose, but I prefer to move forward than work permanently without results.
Well, I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the deputy prime minister, said the preparations would soon be under the direct responsibility of the president and the prime minister.
"The government views UEFA's decision in Bordeaux as proof of Ukraine's confidence in its ability to organise the European Championship together with Poland," Wasjunik said.
“But that’s not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about to begin and there is a lot to do in both countries.”
The timetable for the construction and reconstruction of stadiums, streets, hotels and airports in the host countries is lame.
Possibly the number of stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
Now we have to do work with great speed," said the president of a Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
"UEFA is not going to take our eyes off us."
A more radical step was agreed in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the Polish Olympic Committee suspended the management of the Polish association PZPN and replaced it with the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious danger that the PZPN is not able to follow the rules," Drzewiecki told Polish news agency PAP.
"In a letter we have assured UEFA President Platini that preparation for the 2012 European Championship will not suffer from that."
Only in the last season many clubs of the first division were condemned because of downward manipulation to the lower category, finally also the division council had to be postponed.
Dennis Quaid's Indignant Counterattack
She wanted to promote a new film, spoke in an interview about private life — and has problems with her ex-husband: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has appointed her ex-husband as an adulterer.
He gets angry and counterattacks.
The War of the Roses in Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid's ex-partner: Eight years after their divorce, the two Hollywood actors publicly show an unpleasant fight between them.
Last week in an interview with American magazine InStyle Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the marriage failure: "Dennis was a long time unfaithful to me, and that was very painful."
She knew the size of her infidelity only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new film "The Women" - it tells a story of the failure of a marriage.
Dennis Quaid’s reaction to his appointment as an unfaithful husband was clear: This is “unheard of Meg how many times she tells the stories of our relationship in another version,” the 54-year-old told The New York Daily News.
Among other things, it is very "regrettable" that Jack, his 16-year-old son, will again "remember in public the pain and the changes, all of which means a divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is remarried and recently becomes a twin daddy.
And so he ends his statement by highlighting: "Whatever it is, my life goes on.
I feel happy because I have a wonderful family that’s okay.”
Prices of airline and hotel tickets are falling
In the first half of 2008, air tickets and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper compared to last year.
According to a current study, air tickets in Germany were made cheap by as much as 50 percent.
Airline tickets and overnight stays at hotels were again made cheap – these are the results of a study by American Express’s travel and financial services provider.
The company has analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after price increases in the first quarter found a big change in the second half.
After hotel market prices continued to rise for many years, overnight stays in many places became cheap.
Compared to last year, between January and March prices in 41 of Europe’s 48 different cities rose on average to 6.9 percent.
From April to June prices already fell to 3.6 percent compared to last year.
Trends were more noticeable in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay less than the previous year.
According to American Express, the reason for that was the weakened dollar course, which was the reason that “the interests of American tourists in traveling decreased.”
The decline in hotel prices is also noticeable much more in financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than in industrial hubs such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose to 26.3 percent, breaking a record in Europe.
In the first quarter, airfare prices also showed upward trends:
Because of rising kerosene prices, Economy class travelers had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, long-haul flights even became more expensive up to 29.2 percent.
From April to June, the prices of airline tickets in the Economy class, compared to the previous quarter, fell on average to 12.5 percent, but the price changes for the Businessclass and Firstclass were small.
In Germany, the price change was more noticeable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices rose to 11.9, in the second half they fell to 23.6 percent.
According to one study, prices for domestic flights in Germany even halved.
The cause of the price change is on the one hand the rise of the loose economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the air travel market, demand is falling.
On the other hand, there is great competition for the Open-Skies treaty that liberalizes aircraft traffic between the US and Europe.
The sign of the tense situation is the cancellation of non-profit distance flights on airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 declared bankruptcy - only in Europe there were 24 airlines.
HSV wins against Gladbach 1:0
With a goal and simple methods the Hamburg SV becomes the leader.
Luhukay of Borussia to him does not go out to score the eleventh goal yet.
Kristoffer Klein presented the forced landing of national team player Marko Martin very well.
Gladbach's player started playing late and failed to score a goal.
Everything he wanted to say exactly reacting to what happened, he could read clearly from his lips.
I just knew he was right.
"We need a second goal," Hermann Rieger whistled at the cockpit entrance of Hamburg's stadium.
Nothing special happened in the catacombs, the rest time was over and most of those present were back in their places.
Rieger was an HSV physiotherapist for almost three decades, and enjoys a very high reputation as one of those who formed a part of the group.
That is why his request was noticed by a responsible person.
Cornelius Jol the assistant coach nodded his head and raised his fingers in assent.
Cornelius is the brother of Martin Jol, Hamburg’s head coach.
His order was the same: Wow, the second goal!
But that was not done.
“Not everything was nice to see today,” Marcell Jansen later added.
Bastian Reinhard had also wished to have him "more relaxed".
The result 1:0 (1:0) Hamburg has to thank Mladen Petric (11) with his head impact; and also to the situation that the very weak Gladbach team could not show all its strength to the weak Hamburg team.
“That was a dirty victory,” said Martin Jol.
This Monday the SV of Hamburg will turn 121 years old.
On Saturday night the spectators had already celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the stadium and the change of table on the video screen.
It's gonna be a birthday without a real party.
“We know how to interpret it,” Marcell Jansen said.
It predicts that the partial ratings of the table correspond more to the league's sailing than the dominance of its HSV.
The chip with its late-forced players such as Brazilians Neves and Silva, goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen who was removed from FC Bayern need time to get together, but still the chip can not shine with their successes.
“We need more feeling and dribbling,” Jol demands.
After the loss of the vote
Fear spreads on Wall Street.
The first news about the failure of the banks’ bailout package dropped the Down Jones to 700 points for a certain period.
That was the biggest point loss for a day in his history.
After that, the Dow Jones recovered a bit.
At about 8:30 p.m. one of the world’s most important stock market barometers listed a 5 percent deficit at 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq, the electronic stock market, lost more than seven percent and was down 1,548 points.
At this time the biggest loser on the Dow Jones was American Express which lost almost 14 percent and the Bank of America with a loss of almost 12 percent.
No title could win in value.
The shares of Goldman Sachs lost nearly 10 percent.
Just a few days ago, a major investor Warren Buffett had participated financially in the company.
The bailout plan plans to make resources available to buy so-called "rotten" mortgage stocks.
But the sum is going to be paid at once but step by step.
As compensation for that, the state has to receive share option receipts for financial associations that during course development can be charged to reduce the financial burden of the state cashier.
Stock prices in Europe and the US continue to fall
The $1 billion in aid to banks in Europe and the U.S. does not reassure investors.
The stock price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate falls and negatively influences the Dax.
Despite the state’s projected bailout of the financial market, the U.S. Dow Jones Index continues to fall.
The losses of the speculative shares of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank caused the fall of the German index (Dax) in a large deficit.
Despite the rescue actions of the federal government and private banks, the Munich real estate financier's stock for a period of time lost two-thirds of its value, the Comerzbank lost more than 20 percent.
The Dax clearly fell below the psychological limit of 6000 points and traded a deficit of 3.7 percent at 5,839 units.
All over the world, financial markets have fallen.
The opening of Wall Street in New York City began with notable losses.
Investors fear that the US government’s $700 billion bailout is not enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour after the opening, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3 percent to stay at 10,809.25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives wanted to vote on the salvation project, the Senate vote may be the first of October.
Also the other European balls knew only one trend: at first the FTSE index in London lost 3.2 percent, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan’s main Nikkei index after profit fell to 1.26 percent at 11,743.61 units.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index fell 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the Sensex main index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and closed at 12,595.75 units.
After the announcement of the capital expansion Arcandor shares lost in the MDax.
The private bank Sal. Oppenheim subscribed 23 million new shares.
In addition, the commercial and tourism consortium announced that shares in the Thoms Cook company will not be sold.
Dark matter influences the trajectory of space probes
For many years, a mysterious phenomenon has been causing confusion to researchers: Dark Matter influences the speed of space probes during the so-called gravitational assist to maneuver.
Experts fear Albert Einstein’s Theory of Relativity may not be as correct.
The Ulysses spacecraft spent nearly 18 years flying in the universe.
Because the fuel pipes are freezing, he is now threatened with death in the cold.
For years, a mysterious phenomenon, the anomaly during the gravitational assist to the maneuver, causes confusion among researchers.
Gravitational assistance is a maneuver of the trajectory of space probes during which they obtain an acceleration using the energy of the gravitational field of a planet, for example of the Earth.
That allows space probes to save fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space probe used this physical trick as did the Ulysses Sun probe.
But what surprises researchers for many years: Missiles do not behave 100 percent as expected under the venerable law of gravity.
Rather, they frequent irregularities in speed.
Suddenly the probes have higher or lower speed.
The physicists could not explain this effect until now.
They called it the anomaly during the gravitational assist to the maneuver.
Some experts fear that possibly even Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity describing the force of attraction of matter by the curvature of space may not be as correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physicist at Princeton’s Institute for Advanced Study, solemnly believes now as before that Einstein did not confuse and tries to explain the anomaly during gravitational assist with the help of so-called Dark Matter, in what remained astronomers in the universe.
“The reason for the anomaly may be Dark Matter which may also be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Researchers in the universe have only known the existence of dark matter for ten years.
Supposedly she possesses the force of attraction and her influence can be observed on other planets.
Dark Matter, on the other hand, is completely invisible, which means that it does not send and reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, dark matter makes up at least one-fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Kidnapped tourists in Egypt are free
As Italy’s foreign minister confirmed, after spending ten days in the hands of kidnappers, tourists kidnapped in Egypt must be released.
The kidnappers of the Sudan had demanded millions of ransoms.
Six kidnappers must be killed in a shootout during the release.
Five Germans have been kidnapped in southern Egypt.
Negotiations on the rescue have already begun.
The Germans always fall back into the spotlight of the kidnappers.
The WELT ONLINE newspaper talks about the most important cases.
Apparently, European tourists kidnapped in the Sahara are released.
The same information is presented by the Egyptian state television, the Arabic television station Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
After the news of the release on the Italian broadcaster Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian foreign minister confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages are released.
"We now control his health," Frattini said.
Five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts are fine and are in safety, Egyptian state television reports.
The 19 participants of the expedition in the desert are on their way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible are the reasons for a shootout before the hostages were released: According to the descriptions of an Egyptian security guard, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping, but the Sudanese army had suddenly killed six kidnappers.
“The problem was solved.
They agreed to the rescue," the guard said.
It was just about "receiving the hostages" when suddenly "this surprise" came.
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers killed six kidnappers and detained two in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers have demanded that Germany be ransomed in the amount of six million euros; the money had to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that the release was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid of their safety.
According to the report, the kidnappers intend to release the female hostages after receiving the ransom.
The men had to be detained until the kidnappers had a safe route to escape.
The German embassy in Cairo refused to take a position on this report.
Stepfather Abuse ‘Leaded to Suicide’
According to the court, years of abuse by her stepfather led a woman to kill herself.
Michael Trerise, 57, of Stithians in Cornwall, has been sentenced to five years in prison after admitting eight counts of indecent assaults.
The Royal Court of Truro, through an investigative study, learned that he had regularly tied his daughter Stephanie Randle, when the girl was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confessional paper: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle committed suicide at her Mutley home in Plymouth on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
In the season the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise used to tie her and blindfold her before performing her sexual acts, while her mother was working in a pub.
After the divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
His stepdaughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court learned that Ms. Randle, who spent much of her time working as a volunteer for the National Trust, was tormented by the abuse that had been inflicted on her twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife referred to the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said about her, that having been a great surfer and cyclist, she now seemed "emotionally dead," as if she had "renounced life."
In April 2007, her real father, Terrace Randle, found the woman dead in her Plymouth apartment.
Mrs. Rande is supposed to have killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a letter of confession that concludes by saying, "I used to tie her up and blow her eyes.
It was never a sexual assault.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen responded to Trerise: “You are a very strange fetishist, and for your victim it must have been a horrible experience, especially when he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even clearer, is that if she hadn’t done it, the issue probably wouldn’t have ended up in the courts.”
He added: "I have noticed the effect that according to the description made by Stephanie's father and mother the abuse has been on her daughter over the years.
Clearly she could have had a promising, successful and happy future."
An officer charged with data loss
The BBC was informed that a Cabinet official who forgot some secret documents on the train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, on a working trip by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were handed over to the BBC before they were handed over to the police.
Surely this is the least serious charge under the law and does not imply any indication of intent to commit a crime.
BBC's defence correspondent Frank Gardner said the conviction had come as a surprise to many in the English administration.
"They thought it was an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, the clause that refers to the safeguarding of information.
The Royal Legal Service noted that the official should be charged by the Metropolitan Police, because of the highly sensitive entity of his work in the Committee of Secret Services.
The forgotten documents contained secret information about al-Qaeda and the capacity of the security forces in Iraq.
The officer was informed of the decision on Monday morning and immediately moved from his home to a secret location.
Building companies face the price of B&B
In Britain, construction companies could face a price tag of more than <0xC2><0xA3>80,000 after the rescue/rescue of the Bradford and Bingley bank.
The Government, in effect, provided <0xC2><0xA3>14 trillion to protect the deposits of the bank’s 2.6 million savers.
Interest on the loan will be paid by all companies that use the money of the savers, including the 59 construction companies.
Building Societies Association (BSA) CEO Adrian Coles finds it "humiliating" that societies and their members have to pay
Eventually, the $14 trillion loan should be repaid after the Bradford and Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
However, the interest that accrues in the interim is supposed to be charged each year to the 700 financial companies that have deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Plan confirmed to the BBC that all 59 construction companies are included in that number.
It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently ... be called upon to pay today the price of institutions that have been far less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
That is, each of the companies had to pay in proportion to the bank deposits, and the brokerage companies had to pay approximately 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to <0xC2><0xA3>450,000 in 2009.
This means that companies will have to recover <0xC2><0xA3>81,000 to face the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, director general of the Commercial Association of Construction Societies, told the BBC that this situation is unfair.
“It is humiliating that institutions that behaved prudently in the growth of the real estate market are called upon to pay the price produced by those that were far less prudent.”
According to the BSA, there are no data indicating the failure of any society since 1945.
“We will need to look at all aspects of this issue in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a relevant price,” Mr. Cole added.
The interest earned in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a full year of receivables, which could be almost twice as much.
As construction companies are mutual organizations and there are no shareholders, their members will inevitably end up paying the price, either through higher rates or lower interest on their savings.
The price of milk rises from five pence per liter
The inhabitants of the Jersey estuary will have to pay more for their milk.
The Jersey Dairy newspaper has announced that the highest price of dairy products will increase by an extra five pence per litre from next Monday.
This is the second price increase this year, after a two-pence increase in February and following research carried out by a consulting firm.
Traders can decide for themselves whether they want to apply price increases to their customers.
The last time the highest milk price had risen before February was in 2002.
Ex-Bangladesh prime minister denied bail
A Bangladeshi court has rejected the bail application for former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she can be taken to jail when she returns to her country.
His supporters said the court did not grant him bail by accusing him of extorting 50 million taka ($729,700) from an entrepreneur when he was prime minister.
This is one of several corruption charges against him.
His longtime political rival, Khaleda Zia, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina’s return to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the coming weeks, but his Awami League party has demanded that the country’s militarily supported government first grant him full freedom.
Correspondents say that while she was given conditional release to go abroad and receive medical treatment, it is not clear now what the terms of her release are or whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say they will appeal to the Supreme Court against the High Court’s order.
“The Supreme Court rejected the bail petition for Sheikh Hasina by holding that he could not obtain bail because he was already in treatment abroad under probation,” his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq said.
"We will file an appeal against the order of the Supreme Court."
Her supporters argued that she needed the freedom on bail to return to her country from abroad and prepare for the December elections.
Sheikh Hasina is expected to return to her homeland after October 17, according to an Awami League leader on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the interim government, backed by the military, assumed power, but was released in June to go abroad and receive medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all charges they are charged with.
Fears for the campaign against poliomyelitis in Afghanistan
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan have been unable to take advantage of a recent polio vaccination campaign due to Taliban violence, the UN says.
Last week, the United Nations carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces of the country.
The organization reports that it was unable to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the South for security reasons.
A U.N. spokesman said it happened despite promises made by the Taliban that they would not have attacked or hindered thousands of officials as they carried out vaccinations.
BSkyB loses legal challenge on ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Competition Commission after the decision forced the company to reduce its participation in the rival ITV broadcasting.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Appeals that it will have to reduce its participation of 17.9% in ITV below 7.5%.
Earlier, the Commission said BSkyB’s interests hampered competition and allowed its unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its stock package in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti Monopoly Office reported that BSkyB's acquisition of ITV's stake raised doubts about ITV's independence, and prompted the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
All, including Virgin’s chief, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom’s regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB commented that the obligation to reduce its package on ITV was not reasonable and constituted a disproportionate remedy, particularly because, BSkyB said, it would have handed over its voting rights.
New investigation into the hiring of U.S. lawyers
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the Inspector General of the Department of Justice criticized the actions of administration officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Producer General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by fears that the lawyers had been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy is investigating whether officials interviewed during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice.
"Serious allegations of possible criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved," Attorney General Glenn Bellas said in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to leave their statements.
The discussion began when nine U.S. attorneys were removed from their positions by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At the time, the department justified the decision by suggesting that the lawyers had been fired for low performance.
But it was later learned that lawyers had not been rated worse than other colleagues, and many observers concluded that layoffs would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers in question had worked in the prosecution of some Republicans, high-profile members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate allegations of electoral fraud against Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases for the government
They can be fired at any time, but not removed for political reasons.
The succeeding head of the Department of Justice, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure for the dismissals, resigned his position.
A number of other Justice Department officials did the same.
The Attorney General’s report is highly critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in the case, and underscores how he had a “primary responsibility” for the firings, which he “abdicated” from his leadership position and was “notably uncooperative” in the process.
Other officials, including former Bush collaborator Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
The Epic of Meat Loaf of Much Honor
Rock star Meat Loaf will be honored at the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will pick up the special award next week at the ceremony to be held in London, said getting this recognition will be "an honor."
The song, which lasted nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triumphed in 1977.
The Coldplay group are leading the nominations for this year’s awards and ranking the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that transcend time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them.”
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires excellent vocal ability as was used by Meat Loaf.
An instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the anthem.
The song was first known as a single in the UK in 1979 and became number 15 in the chart.
However, Meat Loaf’s Bat Out Of Hell remained in the charts for about nine years and went on to sell over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery for his heart arrhythmia in 2003, after a collapse during a concert.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel some concerts.
It later emerged that he had a cyst on his vocal cord.
Dark city street, often forgotten and perhaps ready for sale
The city of New York has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other roads, some famous, others simply service.
However, many people, including veteran taxi drivers and long-time local residents, find it difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially since many of them have never heard of this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and extends north of First Street – before I found Second Street – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
This little street, about 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, resembles a dusty alleyway more than an active street.
There are no signs.
It is almost impossible to find in an atlas.
The street, however, has admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company that has recently built luxury buildings on Primeira Street.
who wants to revitalise Extra Place and create a clean corridor to the shops and boutiques that are expected to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include old-time neighbors who commented they were delighted by the truncated lane simply because it is one of the last remnants of the block’s past before the buildings were appropriated.
However, the city’s Department of Housing, Preservation and Development, which has control of the street, has no interest in owning it.
At the meeting of the Community Committee of Vengeance for the use of land that took place this month, representatives of the Avalon agency outlined a proposal to buy the street.
However, the committee, preferring the street to remain in the city, called for a new plan to be presented next month, as Susan Stetzer, the Community District Manager No. 3, said.
"The city owns very few spaces today and we would like it to continue to own Extra Place," said Ms.
“We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage the space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street.”
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that it wanted to repair the small street and install some seats, including some to be used as coffee, waiting to rent the spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street first emerged during this month’s meeting
But Michele de Milly, a spokeswoman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wanted to use the street, it did not necessarily want to own it.
“Avalon Bay’s primary concern is the renovation of this abandoned alley and the possibility of turning it into a public area,” he said, adding that the proposed sale came from the city itself.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Preservation Committee, confirmed that it was the city’s desire to sell the street and noted that the agency’s mission is to develop property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful surroundings, those of the Bowery, Extra Place has left a mark on history.
Some believe that it got its name in 1802, when Philip Minthorne's large estate was divided among his children and this narrow strip of land was not claimed by anyone.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opens at Extra Place, but the street is perhaps best known for the photograph of the establishment that comes out on the cover of Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" album.
"The setting was magnificent," said Danny Fields, the Ramones' manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, sheets, ropes."
Some residents, including bloggers who write about the East Village’s burgeoning, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that public goods, however modest they may be, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rare piece, virtually unchanged, a city sliver that should be protected.
Jeremiah Moss, who runs a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), has made available part of a talk in the city's history about Extra Place, published by The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a somewhat narrow and dead end alley, dark also by day and marked by rusty iron warehouse doors and back-windows, with week-old newspapers blown along the canyons."
With few exceptions, the street looked more or less the same on a recent afternoon.
A rat was cured through the back of the street and stood near the door that was used to enter the CBGB and now houses a luxury clothing store.
Graffiti on the walls and an empty beer bottle of about 22-oz were near a new batch of discarded newspapers.
Some interns said they rarely paid attention to Extra Place, but suggested it could be given a cleanup.
Mr. Fields, for his part, noted that some people underestimate the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I spent the best years of my life," he said, "in dark, damp, disgusting places."
The debate on bilingualism: immersion in the English language
In this chapter of Education Watch, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of candidates on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a senior associate in California studies and director of studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-author of the book "Not as Good as You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs School Choice."
Calling Hispanic voters effectively is a difficult business.
The education proposals made by Barack Obama are an example of that.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that “African-Americans and Latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” and this is a very true consideration.
To combat such differences in learning events, Obama’s education plan specifically advocates, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English-students.
However, the open question for Mr. Obama is whether the commitment of bilingual education, which prefers classroom instruction in languages other than English, is effective in nullifying the distance in the final results.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the eastern Los Angeles County region.
In this school the vast majority of students are Hispanic and low-income families:
More than a third of students, many of whom are newcomers, are learning the English language.
However, an incredible 100 percent of fourth-year students have been positively assessed in the 2008 math exam.
and almost an equally amazing 93 percent have mastered the English language and arts test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient than Mr. Obama favored.
Sixth Street School emphasizes review and practice, constant assessment of competencies, and does not tolerate any attitude of excuses.
In addition, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, the principal of Sixth Street, the school’s approach to teaching English to students is in “total immersion.”
Immersion in English means the almost exclusive use of language in the treatment of the contents of instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “We’ve had extraordinary successes with students like the last one who came from Mexico and that if you go into the classroom 12 months later you wouldn’t be able to pick up what was.”
"It works," he said, "we think it works."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for replicating by other schools with large populations of Hispanic-English students?
The results achieved by this school should remove any doubt about the answer, but the idea of their party’s politicians on the issue of education (the National Education Associations have long been advocates of bilingual education) and their very constant support for bilingual education obscures Mr. Obama’s prediction of the answer.
While it is that immigrants should learn English, recently Mr. Obama has trivialized the issue by letting people stop worrying about legislation that is only written in English.
and instead, he said, "you should make sure your child can speak Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to improve the system and close loopholes, he should carefully consider education models that work well, rather than disparaging or trivializing them.
Oil prices fall sharply after renewed economic fears
The price of oil dropped sharply on Monday because of concerns that the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to reactivate the economy.
Shares of crude oil fell 7 percent to $99.80 a barrel in the morning trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has dropped by more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the past two weeks, commodity markets have been rocked by the Wall Street financial crisis and a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After hitting a high of $145.29 per barrel in July, prices had fallen to nearly $90 per barrel earlier this month, before retreating, once again, due to huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety gripped investors once again on Monday, despite congressional leaders saying they had reached a deal over the weekend on the bailout plan, the largest in history.
The news was overshadowed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far from over.
The evolution that occurred in the last episode of the merger process confirms that Citigroup will buy Wachovia Corporation’s banking operations, the government said Monday.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said that, on the hectic weekend, the negotiations that led to the bailout deal “seem to have failed to reactivate market sentiment.”
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to fall.
“The prospects for global equity, interest rate and exchange rate are going to be increasingly uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that commodities will not be able to escape this contagion.
From the product perspective, our most pressing concern is whether the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Analysts at the bank have lowered their expectations for next year, as low oil consumption due to the crisis in economic growth and the forecast of a reduction in the price of oil and gas is 20 percent for 2009.
Second Quarter Madness: Team Sets Record
After spending, over the past eight seasons, more time than anyone in the Jets uniform, playing in defense, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he saw how things unfolded in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets turned an unrecorded game into a deflation game.
“I’ve never seen anything like it,” Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had lazily played under the shadows of the clouds.
At this point it happened that quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles scoring a 12-yard goal and suggesting the perfect omen for an afternoon, in which the evolution of the relationship between the players took a big leap forward.
Favre found Coles for two more goals in the quarter, one when one cornerback fell and another came with 10 seconds in the half.
"I didn't get out of my way," Favre said of all the steps that went to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, regardless of what people may think.”
While Favre and Coles were in the hold, the Cardinals' defense mistreated quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a passing shot and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith scored another pass and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was forced to miss by Warner.
In the last turnover, the fouls forced by Bowens, could have been the best.
The Cardinals had taken possession with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ball, Jay Feely kicked him 20 yards to win a final 34-0.
They are the biggest points the Jets never made in a quarter.
The team’s coach, Eric Mangini, asked him to describe the madness of this moment, said, “The second quarter or the third quarter?”
When both were answered - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said, "I can say I liked the second quarter a lot more than the third.
They’ve won a lot of points in a very short period of time.”
Gebrselassie rested tops her world record
Once again, Ethiopia’s Haile Gebrselassie has demonstrated why many consider him the greatest runner in history, beating his own world record at the Berlin Marathon this Sunday and becoming the first person able to run the 26.2-mile race in 2 hours 4 minutes.
After the victory in the comfortable flat race in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has smashed for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie has set the 26th world record in a race of impressive length so he has set a world championship or world record for any distance, from the time trial to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie did not take part in the Olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing – perhaps too alarmingly, in retrospect – that air pollution would aggravate her asthma problems.
Instead, he set out to race in Berlin.
In practically perfect conditions - sunny and with 48 degrees at the start of the race, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Sunday, using on average 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile.
Since track runners such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long distances, the marathon record has been reduced by more than two minutes in the last decade, as Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil won in Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters he had suffered calf cramps two weeks earlier and had missed a week of training.
It is obvious that the suspension left you fresh, not rusty.
"I'm very happy," Gebrselassie told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I had some doubts, but in the end everything went well."
The athlete has been the subject of some criticism – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s Afro-Eastern rival – for the style of orchestrating his races too much, in general, avoiding the encounter with many world marathon stars, relying on pacers as if it were a race track, and putting the records ahead of the sense of competition.
But this criticism does not diminish the greatness of Gebrselassie’s skills as a runner.
This Sunday, on the march of four Kenyans, Gebrselassie reached half the race in 1:02:04.
Two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to challenge Gebrselassie after his paces dwindled.
But just before three miles from the finish, Gebrselassie took a final push to break away from Kwambai, who finished second at 2:05:36, improving his best personal record by almost five minutes.
Kamathi came in third place at 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan but now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Great Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, 36-year-old Mikitenko was a surprise and won the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She also did not take part in the Beijing Games for what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and set her best-record staff in almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
He made a smart calculation run, leaving a quartet of Kenyan and Ethiopian runners to head off and then recovering them after 18 1<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia won second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a city apart, the pride and tests of life of color
Hidden by the expansion of the theme park of the great Orlando, a few kilometers from the bright, noisy and colossal city, lies a quiet village, where the pride and complications of the African-American experience are very evident.
Eatonville, the first completely black-inhabited city incorporated into the country and Zora's childhood place of Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as she described it in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 colored men, 300 good swimmers, many guavas, two schools and not even a prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Fair in Eatonville to pay tribute to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
And yet, in many ways, the city she described—making it also a tourist spot through its inclusion in the Florida travel guide produced by the Federal Writers’ Project of the Depression Season—still stands apart.
The city remains independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true ideas with the white man, who “knows so little about us and doesn’t know what’s going on.”
Even now, in the year that a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called attention to starting a dialogue on the issue of race, many remain wary of the outsider.
“We’re very cautious about how our story is told,” said Jones Hortense, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
“It has to be right.”
Eatonville has always been defined as a paradox of triumph and struggle.
It is at the same time a historical model of the affirmation of blacks and a community of nearly 2,400 people living below a poverty level double the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the rural culture of the Black South – sometimes scorned, others praised – that was born of slavery in America.
No wonder, if those who reside here are both proud and reserved.
And the concern for Eatonville's image really started with Zora, as no one here calls her Mrs. Hurston.
She introduced her hometown to the world through her deep-rooted dialect books like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in Florida’s guide transformed the city, just off Route 17, a road that runs through central Florida often forgotten in the history of blacks and human drama.
Having a concrete face in both life and literature, Mrs. Hurston took her readers to Eatonville’s first mayor’s owned store, Joe Clarke, and then into more private areas.
"Out of the left hand road," he wrote, "there is the modern brown public school with its white finishes, its well-maintained gardens and playgrounds, cared for by Howard Miller, as he can barely read and write."
She also mentions the widow's new husband Dash and writes that Glenn Lee "sells drinks of all kinds and anything goes with transient rooms."
Thus, in just a few hundred words, Mrs. Hurston relates Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, second marriage, and sex.
Obviously, this fucker didn't do it.
In fact, not everyone appreciated the portrait.
“Zora described it as it was,” said Ella Dinkins, 90, one of the Johnson girls Mrs. Hurston immortalized by citing men who were singing colorless songs about their beauty.
He added: "Some people didn't like that."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who returned frequently after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77, remembers that when Mrs. Hurston arrived in town, she did so without warning in a large Chevrolet, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still today prides itself on wearing with dignity.
Most residents were fascinated, Mr. Franklin said, while many laughed sarcastically.
“People were always so happy to see Zora,” Mr. Franklin says.
But, she adds, swaying in her chair in a backyard overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "she never stayed too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were no longer in print.
Like most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten about her.
Although she was a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only woman of color at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an anonymous grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had been living.
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorative ceremonies, no major public readings.
“I don’t think her contribution to the world or her heritage was understood,” said Valerie Boyd, author of “Wrapped in Rainbows,” a biography of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain turn came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to put a five-lane highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-lane street of the labor community.
The expansion of the Orlando area had already pushed Interstate 4 across the western edge of the city.
The proposal came at a time when Eatonville was recovering from a difficult period in its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had put an end to his relatively idyllic isolation from the community.
In the 1950s, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred closer to the community.
“During that season, a group of white boys were going around town throwing oranges and everything against the people who were sitting next to them,” Mr. Franklin said.
"They also killed a girl once.
They threw him against a car watermelon."
In a 1955 letter to Mrs. Hurston he wrote to The Orlando Sentinel, criticizing the forced integration by the Supreme Court which, in Brown v. Board of Education "insulted rather than honor my race."
A Residents today say that school desegregation, positive in some respects, had weakened Eatonville's cohesion and undermined the confidence of its youth.
“Black kids were used to being hugged — I remember this — used to hugged the teacher in the morning and at night,” said N.Y. Nathri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit organization.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students did not come from the same place.
“I wasn’t hugging your teacher because it was white — there’s a cultural gap there,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, actors, and artists who passed over prejudices, just as she did, with buoyant, confident, and lines like, “How can anyone deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, writer Alice Walker went to Mrs. Hurston's anonymous grave and began fighting to resurrect her reputation.
Five years later, an acclaimed biography of Mrs. Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in bookstores, reintroducing it into American canons.
The road project came just as Eatonville’s most famous daughter was going under the spotlight again.
And this time, Mrs. Hurston's old neighbors saw her as a savior.
In 1988, the community began planning a fair for Mrs. Hurston to show what the county could ruin with that road.
Thousands of fans arrived at the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return for the celebration.
After several years, the county has abandoned its road proposal.
“The resurrected idea of the five-lane road would have been to put in what you would call bending speed, a real civic pride,” said Ms. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said it more simply, "Zora saved Eatonville."
The victory over the road project has helped change the image of the same city.
Outsiders like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to review the past.
Eatonville entered the National Historical Register in 1998.
A new library (named Hurston, of course) opened its doors in 2006, on a reburied and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville is still an anomaly in Florida: just six miles from downtown Orlando, you can sometimes feel like on a street of the past in a summer rain, in a city as small as the one that was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880s.
(90 percent of people are black today.)
Strangers who come in search of Eatonville’s story, of its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A permit in advance is necessary to do most of the interviews, and some things – such as the murals in Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field – cannot be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a courageous and convinced teacher who has a weakness for bright red, still fear that her island community may be misunderstood.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has expanded, a higher level of natal pride has also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville in the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw her whole race: beauty, and all the problems, no better, no worse, and equally to the other racial and ethnic groups in America, proud, creative, hardworking, silly, and mixed.
It’s a sincere civic sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin’s 18-year-old nephew, Edwin Harvey, who is scheduled to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or by the Police Department, which he said might need some help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Most people, in case they dare to go this far, will have to think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to any other,’” says Alondra Kenon after going to church on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at its history, it’s a very nice city.”
Here in New York, everyone is talking about finance.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the kiosks and giant TV screens in Times Square, they would not realize they were in the eye of the hurricane.
They could never imagine that behind the glass facade of the beehive offices that lie above their heads, bankers and speculative fund managers who monopolize New York face the worst “bad office day” since the 1929 downpour.
Guys for home delivery keep resonating their metal tea carts through the sidewalks and carrying trays of muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latino men continue to drag between charged apartment buildings, just like human mules, with 50 eccentrically stamped shirts hanging from a yoke across their shoulders. Office workers are still waiting in line for their morning take-away food, and it remains impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m. on business days.
Employees are still waiting for their bagel to line up the sellers’ carts, and it’s still impossible to find a taxi between four and five in the afternoon on weekdays.
It seemed to me that there was no crisis at all, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pessimistic forecasts there are, I decided to open a new savings account.
Although I had calculated the time needed for the operation to coincide with the late afternoon calm at my local JP Morgan Chase affiliate, a queue of about 20 people was already waiting.
And not in front of the employee’s window, to withdraw their cash or make a deposit, but in front of the customer service bank, where lifelong customers order their checkbooks, tourists look for instructions to go to Macy’s department stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people preceded me, I was informed later by Starr, my “trusted personal banker,” and they were in line for the same reason I was.
Unlike me, they had already withdrawn their savings from the smaller banks in places from where they had switched them, places like New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They had taken their money from the so-called savings associations (a bit like a construction society), credit unions and savings banks of their hometown whose whites only function within the state of belonging, and who say they treat customers like their family.
Over the past year, 15 of these banks have silently failed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers headed home Friday night for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, with savings deposits of $440 billion, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers in the offices and shops that were standing in front of me, fearing another collapse, were moving their money to a bank to what is considered a safe haven, which is doing most of the rescues on Wall Street.
Ordinary people in New York City have become financial experts in recent weeks.
A woman at my local Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the failed bank, and its distraught-looking CEO, Dick Fuld, commenting on the matter with familiarity as if they were complaining about a colleague’s inactivity.
And Lyn, in her fifties and a bit of a waiter in my apartment block uniform, has changed the normal course of our conversations about Brad and Angelina or my groceries at the store.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I now have all my savings in money market funds.
The switch is done, I'm not taking any risk."
Desecrated Muslim Tombs as Austria Approaches Right
Heinz-Christian Strache, of the left wing of the far-right party for the freedom of Austria and Belgian Filip Dewinter, affiliated with the far-right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organization "Cities against Islamization" in Antwerp, on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry traffic signs representing mosques with a red line running through them.
Police are blaming far-right extremists for desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same weekend that far-right political parties made huge gains in the country’s general election.
More than 90 graves were severely damaged in the Traun cemetery near Linz sometime between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The criminals sprayed Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David on some of the graves, but investigators think this may have happened by trying to hide the real motives of extremists driven by hatred against Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident was in any way related to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic Community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the desecration, which came to Muslim clerics as the month of Ramadan was ending.
Meanwhile, Austria is preparing for a round of introspection after the turn to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that won nearly 30 percent of the vote, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, had led a campaign focused on anti-immigration vehemence and some of their slogans were considered xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the vote, campaigned against headscarves and burqas, and also voiced opposition to foods considered related to Islam.
At his last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European brotherhood” to prevent the emergence of Islam.
Both parties intend to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they were symbols of the ongoing Islamization policy in Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which have confirmed the far right as the country’s strongest political bloc, indicate that the change came mainly from young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel ban for Gary Glitter
Courts have banned Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star guilty of child sexual abuse, from traveling to France and Spain.
The judges imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the surveillance authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
Kent police issued a travel ban last Thursday after magistrates produced evidence of Glitter’s earlier convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, real name Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, but was represented by Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Court Service said: "On Thursday 25 September at the Ashford Magistrates' Court in Kent, police requested a provision to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd's travel abroad as he did to France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd didn't attend in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed authorities that he wished to travel abroad, by virtue of being under the register of sex offenders.
He has to inform the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days
and it is also necessary to inform the police of the scheduled date seven days in advance of their departure.
Kent police said they would not discuss Glitter's individual case or possible whereabouts in the county.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “The Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
A Kent Police spokesman said: “The Kent Police will do everything possible to protect children in this country, or abroad.
“From our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the UK because here we have the systems to manage all possible risks more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is the Kent Police’s primary concern and we work closely together to monitor the behavior of registered sex offenders in the county and minimize any risks that may exist to the public.”
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for the abuse of two girls, aged between 10 and 11.
When he was released Glitter flew to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities did not allow him to go through passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also denied him entry and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
He probably arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Magistrates' Court, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to register as a sex offender.
Glitter had been jailed in the UK for four months in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A source from the Ministry of the Interior reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of the Interior was reassured and glad to learn that Glitter had been banned from travelling to France and Spain.
"I capture the teacher offstage to extract his character" G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer_Photographer
No heels, no flyers, no opening costumes.
The essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration in interpretation to obtain the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On one side is the artist.
The other, the person.
Inseparable except in intimacy, in those moments alien to the public, when you find the privacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of a hands, carefree because they will not go out on stage.
The German G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Bauer alternates in "Flamenco-people" the theatricality of some staged with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser known side of these masters.
With this proposal, the photographer collects the particular iconography of flamenco from different fields.
Included in the program of the Month of Flamenco Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day", explains the creator, who clarifies that "Flamenco-people" "can be any people but, seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists on the stage.
These people portrayed "in the street" are artists capable of conveying on stage passion, sadness, joy... captivating the audience.
To capture the personality of these artists you do not have to take photos of the stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
What interested me was to create an intimate atmosphere that allowed me to capture with the camera the personality of the greats of flamenco.
With the taste of the "Song of Mines" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey to portray singers, guitarists or dancers with a plate camera.
They are portraits that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, recall the classic photography.
The application of different stylistic media breaks with the classic basis of the image, giving it modernity, an idea that reflects how Bauer himself understands flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots, which evolves and surprises every day".
It is not the action of the dance, of the song or of the touch itself, but the personality of the artist, his character, that captivates the public with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essentials, with the goblin that becomes visible in a way of feeling, of being and of being are and have been the constant of this work that is presented these days in the gallery El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata.
Famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of almost seventy photographed artists.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits exhibited in the exhibition.
Bauer's passion for portraits led him to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of Veterans Athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "I love to portray people, meet them and be able to enter a moment in their life, whether a long or short moment.
I think that within photography, portraiture is the most difficult genre.
You meet or face people, characters, who sometimes you do not know, or who leave you only a few minutes to take the photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to make my ideas come true.”
This collection of portraits of the current flamenco that bears the title "Flamenco-people" is exhibited in the Gallery El Fot<0xC3><0xB3>mata, located at number 20 of the street of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, where you can visit until October 16.
Vargas Llosa confesses that the novel he writes is "a temerity"
It’s set in places he doesn’t know yet and it’s about unknown issues, but still, Mario Vargas Llosa is committed to pushing forward the new project he’s working on, a novel starring Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived in the Congo for twenty years and went through the Amazon.
The ever-favorite Nobel Prize in Literature confessed yesterday in his passage at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project that occupies him today "is a temerity" and that "everything indicates that he should not write" the novel.
"If it were sensible, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope to finish it someday," he concluded in his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he has seen pass through the city of the Aqueduct to a hundred writers, historians and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The City and the Dogs" was one of the prominent figures of the third edition of the word party and fulfilled the forecasts.
Vargas Llosa, who has won the Hay Festival award for being the most voted writer by participants - an old edition of Dickens's "Our mutual friend", filled the void of the Juan Bravo theater.
Presented by Félix Romeo, he found before him an audience devoted to which he was made very short the hour in which the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with a great dose of humor, is inspired by how his literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure to read" and "live more of what he lived" and how he writes.
The Spanish-American novelist acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know if books change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is a pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," stressed Vargas Llosa, who said that it "has effects" and "makes people more incongruous", so he asked the writers "to give up their responsibility" and "give up" with responsibility.
The climatology reduces the fair of Pozoblanco that also remains without fences
The festival of districts that closed the fertilizer of the fair of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after checking the regionators announced that the floor of the square was not in the best conditions.
Thus, the company, according to Ferm<0xC3><0xAD>n Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather inclement weather has been primed with this fair, as finally two of its three festivities have not been able to be celebrated.
On Saturday it was the rain that prevented the celebration of the second planned bullfight.
The poster was composed by José Luis Moreno, Curro D<0xC3><0xAD>az and Juan Bautista, who were going to face a siege of Castilblanco
So, only on Friday there was a celebration.
In it, the winner was Daniel Luque who cut off three ears and came out on his shoulders, after leaving passages with taste and aesthetics.
That same afternoon Alejandro Talavante sold his two stallions with greetings and an ear, which granted more tended than his bull.
That yes, even worse was El Juli, who passed through the body of Los Llanos without pity or glory.
In his second bull, after a work of relief he won the bronze of a large part of the audience.
A control jump in <0xC3><0x81>lava in a van with two thousand kilos of hashish
Five minus ten in the morning.
Traffic control of the Ertzaintza in the municipality of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n (<0xC3><0x81>lava).
Officers stop the two occupants of a van and they flee.
Its load, more than two tons of hashish, was not like to stop.
The officers chased them and arrested one of the two occupants, a 28-year-old man identified as A. A. J., the Basque Government’s Interior Department said in a statement.
The arrested individual has been charged with drug trafficking and falsification of a public document.
The incident was recorded when several officials of the <0xC3><0x81>lava Traffic Unit carried out a transport control in the N-1, as they passed through the municipal district of Armi<0xC3><0xB1><0xC3><0xB3>n.
They were about to stop a van for inspection when the driver disobeyed orders, abruptly accelerated and skipped control.
The agents began their chase until the vehicle stopped a couple of kilometers later in the arcane, at which point its two occupants clung to flee to the race for a wooded area.
The Ertzains finally reached one of them and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they were carrying and found after inspecting the van, an Iveco Daily.
The rear of the vehicle was loaded with hashish loads, so they proceeded to move it to police stations for a thorough inspection and weighing of the drug.
In addition, the officials found that the registration had been "doubled" as it did not coincide with the collection in the documentation of the van, so the arrested has also been charged with a crime of falsification of a public document.
Ertzaintza continues with the investigation to proceed to the arrest of the other suspect, who managed to escape to the race as has been said, and determine the origin of the seized drug.
The detainee, A. A. J., 28, was transferred to police stations to carry out the corresponding proceedings and will be made available to the court in the coming hours.
Actress Heather Locklear Arrested for Driving Under the Effects of Medication
Actress Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda from the Melrose Place series, has been arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California for driving under the effects of some medication.
A witness saw her perform strange maneuvers as she tried to get out of her parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness has detailed that about 4.30 p.m., Locklear “was treading deeply on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying to pull the car out of the parking lot back and forth, and as he went back he passed several times over his sunglasses.”
Shortly after, the witness, who apparently did not recognize the actress at first, saw that Locklear stopped on a nearby highway and got out of the vehicle.
This person was the one who alerted the emergency services because “I was worried about Locklear’s life.”
When the police patrol arrived they found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which was partially blocking the road.
"She looked disoriented," so the agents took her to the specialized drug and alcohol center for a test.
According to a police spokesman, the actress was cooperative and the excess alcohol was ruled out from the first moment, although "according to the officers at first glance, we believe that Locklear was under the influence of some drug."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the effects of some unspecified substance and entered the local prison at about 7 p.m. although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear left an Arizona treatment clinic where he was recovering from an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU Federation to assume its competences in the Silva case
The general coordinator of IU and deputy of Izquierda Unida, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it will be the regional federation of the formation that will have to make a decision on the case of the former councilor of Youth and Sports of the City of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week after he was accused of performing favors to relatives.
"For these things I am very federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to take over its powers," Llamazares said about the action that the party must adopt with which he has so far advised in the Seville Consistory.
However, the IU leader argued that the need for “transparency” is present in the possible investigations into irregularities that Silva may have committed: “IU has always advocated that these types of issues have the highest degree of transparency.”
In the same line he stressed that the formation has "strict ethical codes for all public offices".
'Blood of May', Garci's epic bet
Inspired by the National Episodes of Benito Pérez Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD> recreates the famous uprising of the Spanish against the French in Sangre de Mayo, which is the most ambitious film in its filmography with about 15 million euros budget.
In this way, the filmmaker has tried to "illustrate the torrent of characters and social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the well-known novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarr<0xC3><0xAD>a at the head of a wide cast of performers.
Blood of May, with a footage of more than two and a half hours, opens this Friday in the cinemas, to become in the future a miniseries for Telemadrid of more than four hours duration.
A great admirer of the literature of Gald<0xC3><0xB3>s, José Luis Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a says that he has fulfilled with this shooting "a childhood dream", which must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid commissioned him three years ago to shoot a commemorative tape for the second centenary of May 2, Madrid, something he accepted as long as the national story is told.
The 15 million budget that the Community of Madrid has contributed in its entirety constitute for Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a a "unique opportunity" to set up with the decorations and the appropriate costumes the portrait of "an atolled Spain that was mistaken as the chief for which to fight, since, the struggle for independence led the people to enormous delay with the reign of Ferdinand VII".
But the filmmaker regrets not having had a funding like Alatriste or Goya's Ghosts - more than double that of Blood of May -, so he has not been able to shoot some scenes in a script signed with Horacio Valc<0xC3><0xA1>rcel, with whom he has collaborated in almost his entire career.
Therefore, the director of Back to the beginning, has focused on what is his usual way of working, the staging with the actors, with whom he usually rehearses before starting filming and to those who does not cast, for it seems "humiliating" and consider that "part of the director's job is to go to the theater and the cinema to work on what happens".
Many of the performers with whom he coincides in Sangre de Mayo repeat before his camera, such as Miguel Rell<0xC3><0xA1>n, Carlos Larra<0xC3><0xB1>aga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
An Oscar candidate on four occasions – of which he won one –, Garci considers that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Blood of May itself, Seven French billiard tables and the finally selected, The Blind Sunflowers, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is the one that must be made known".
With this film Garcia does not expect awards.
“In the beginning you think you work for posterity, then you realize that you only work for prosperity, and now you settle for making one more movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of professional career.
Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n recovers the essence of the Seville dancer T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia
A Sevillian dancer is going to pay tribute to a Sevillian dancer too.
Carmen T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Valencia, born to a Catalan father (Floren<0xC3><0xA7> T<0xC3><0xB3>rtola Ferrer) and an Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana neighborhood and when she was three years old she moved to London with her family.
She was a free dance dancer and specialist in oriental dances.
She had an exciting life, pioneering the liberation of women, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddhist and vegetarian and advocated the abolition of the corset that prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked a dance and aesthetic revolution in Europe between wars, fascinated Isabel Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
“I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and she introduced me to this character and I thought it was amazing.”
According to the dancer, "we do not intend to tell her life but to collect her spirit.
The titles of his dances have suggested flamenco sticks to me.
Thus, "the butterfly dance" suggested to me a guajira, or "the snake dance" some tangos.
Their dance was sensual and I have been told that my dance is also within this aesthetic,” she says.
The montage has two exceptional collaborations: that of Miguel Poveda who will sing Isabel in one again in his shows, as he did in the one of "The Open Door"; and with the teacher Matilde Coral, who has exceptionally wanted to collaborate with who was his student.
"Matilde makes Tortola older, the character of maturity.
I’m happy because I’ve accepted to act in my work and I feel very honored for it.”
The montage also features the musical composition and guitars of Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi de Mor<0xC3><0xB3>n; the percussion of El P<0xC3><0xA1>jaro, as well as the viola of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfra Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez, "who plays the role of the eternal companion of this type of artists who were always in and divas in.
The work also somehow tells the life of this woman who developed in such distant places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, in addition to throughout Europe, since she habitually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think it's those women who have a huge influence in a given time and now nobody knows and much less values her work," says Bay<0xC3><0xB3>n.
The show will begin today at 20.30 at the Lope de Vega theatre.
The publication of the "Diary of a newly married poet" also closes the Triennium
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), a place where Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a to celebrate the "Trienio de Zenobia y Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" (2006 to organize the Zenobia with the
In this way, the "Trienio Zenobia y Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n" comes to an end with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the House Museum of the Nobel and with the traveling exhibition "Juan Ram<0xC3><0xB3>n Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after traveling through the different provinces, will continue.
Also, the Ministry of Culture of the Junta de Andaluc<0xC3><0xAD>a has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacobo Pérez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal Andalusian poets.
America Likes It Less Without Paul Newman
Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.”
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "Absence of Malice", and gives the idea of the helplessness of American cinema, and of all America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman is gone.
It cost him an Oscar.
He has been retired since 2007.
And I knew he was very sick.
Still, it has been a blast for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels is beyond expression, and I have now lost a great friend,” Robert Redford cried, “my life and my country were better because of their existence.”
No one was afraid to make a fool of themselves or exaggerate.
A father of the cinema and the homeland had died at a particularly dark time, fearing terrorists and markets, with American self-esteem on the ground, desperately searching for reasons for dignity.
When time is so hard and without virtue men and very few beings to admire you remain, you do not need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
It embodied for all an almost platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was a formal enemy of Richard Nixon and advocate for lost and won causes, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of his first-born son killed by overdose to his home-made and organic food brand.
A gift to a country that has taken a long time to overcome a suicidal food culture.
The expansive wave of admiration swept Hollywood without regard to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, found that not a man has died but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was nothing short of the pinnacle of his career.
Australia’s bad boy Russell Crowe dared to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
“It has left us all a very high bar,” said George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who dares to try to live as Paul Newman did today: keeping the demand for probity high and for a serious private life away from the cameras.
This is not always easy or even possible in today’s media jungle.
But there are those who try, and Paul Newman is his example.
He divorced once but was then married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he was faithful when the chances of not being were sure.
“But why am I going to eat hamburger outside the house, if I have steak inside?” he used to joke.
In heaven, he is proud that on earth his daughters coincide with his fans, something not so common in America.
“Of all the great roles he played, none was as proud as that of a devoted husband, loving father, caring grandfather and dedicated philanthropist,” they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is to hold an Olympics in Madrid and, after the failed 2012, it may be 2016.
But I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday's race, I say no!
The perfect race was called it, and in my opinion it has been the worst race with a lot of it I’ve been in.
A pile of nonsense that, of course, if they considered it as an evaluation and I examined it, would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go parts and from the beginning.
The purposeless begin with the collection of the dorsal, which makes you have to go before.
Which I don’t think is bad, but if they already make you go they give it all (including the chip to avoid queues in the race).
Well, no.
Here they only made you go to pick up the dorsal (first nonsense, go only for that) and (after the relevant tail), surprise!, there was only size 'S' for the T-shirt (second nonsense, because I need a size XL)
What world do we live in?
Or is it that because of the crisis they have decided to buy only small t-shirts with fewer fabrics and cheaper ones?
Well, things like this are a little bit like race day.
Apart from having to go very early to pick up the chip, the queue on arrival is 15 minutes and, in addition, you have to leave the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, something incomprehensible for a race where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as was to be expected, the race began and we had not yet left the backpack, although once achieved, the pick-up was worse.
In addition, the rain eased the wait for more than 40 minutes, which was joined by popular rebellion and assault on the house.
I think that about 500 people will probably have pneumonia tomorrow, and some like me, will not even appear with the right time in the classification, because of the chip they gave me that, I guess, did not mark the exit correctly.
Of course, if they asked me about the perfect race, it wouldn’t fit in my thoughts.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a receptionist (virtual)
At the MIT Emerging Technologies conference, Microsoft has shown an advance of a new system of image recognition and human interaction, a kind of AI without much intelligence but capable of performing some basic tasks, such as ordering a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shuttle to move around the company’s campus) listening to what you hear in conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of shapes and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who they are - even remember what they are wearing - and listen and understand the keywords of their conversations.
Also group the attendees according to the conversation groups.
In the sample video the receptionist detects a third person but understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks if he is there to visit someone and tells him that he will see you soon.
All without blue screen.
Impressive.
But that, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its operating system, Windows.
This week there has been a lot of talk about a strategy change at Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if computers came with the essentials instead of loaded commercial garbage, they would go five times faster – man, Steve, it will be for less.
A whole finding considering that Microsoft, version after version, has added features and "extras" to Windows.
The change of direction is appreciated.
Microsfot is right, the operating system is losing importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome came online, I was one of those who added to the theory that it was Google’s first step in competing with Windows.
Many rightly pointed out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is the essential layer for the Hardware and Software to be understood.
It performs the same function as your wife or husband when you have to tell your mother-in-law something.
It's true.
It will never disappear but we must think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer has said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
The computer starts only to run Firefox or Explorer – or Chrome – and every day we spend more time browsing than in the window environment.
What do half of the applications that come in the system do?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be less, much less, than Vista.
Less heavy, less recharged, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services and finally being an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, in fact, and I bring you a small example.
The photo of this post was taken in one of Microsoft’s employee lounges in Redmond earlier this month.
On the soda machine a poster asks them to use their search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the web.
Last week, by the way, a delay in the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was also confirmed.
It will not come at the beginning of 2009 but at the end, rather pulling in 2010.
In Microsoft will surely look for the joint release of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more and more computer every day.
But the delay, with Android and the iPhone already on the street, will pass bill.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Blue Coast, Leonardo di Caprio wore one in Edward Zwick's 'Blood Diamond', the same as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's 'The Godfather' and is part of the uniform of the gay parish muscled.
And if we start to list stellar apparitions, we can go back to the image of that pointed mustache who was lifting weights in a walking circus.
In essence, it is nothing more than the typical men's t-shirt in cotton, sewn and sleeveless.
The 'tank', which the English call the speakers, but Le Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles stands out above all others.
First, because of its flamboyant name - although familiarly known as 'Marcel' - it has to do with the sport because it receives its name, according to legend, from the boxer Marcel Cerdan, lover of the singer Edith Piaf.
'La Marcel' stands out above all others for its excellent cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive shield and for the small Belgian flag (only recognizable) that the most emblematic T-shirt models wear as detail on the neck.
And pay attention, because the production of the Belgian firm does not only focus on its tank tops.
It also includes college sweatshirts, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, cotton pants, navy T-shirts, babies, mini shorts...
Clothing designed for underwear comfort.
It's a shame to leave them as underwear though.
They have too much charm.
"I want to be a young mom; the candidate doesn't worry me"
His enormous resemblance to his sister has not stopped him from developing his own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of vitality.
Currently the Cruz sisters take their new fashion activity very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful and famous girls who lend their name.
He has been in Paris in the promotion that the firm Mango makes at its new headquarters, in addition to the presentation of the most important fashion awards that the Spanish house sponsors.
Warm and shy, wins in the short distances.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I have come to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I have designed for Mango in this new autumn-winter season, in addition to attending the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the Opera dinner in honor of Valentino.
Come, a very intense day but, at the same time, exciting.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango in this fourth season working for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 50s and 60s; from there we get a lot of references.
Then, I really like to get lost in a city and watch women get dressed, how they combine and mix their clothes, I do it a lot.
Dancer, actress and designer, you're a very multifaceted woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything comes together and they have a lot in common.
When I was little, I liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to dig into my aunt’s closets and see her clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better than going to the amusement park.
Then, as a dancer, I always tried to take care of how I dressed.
You know, we dancers really like to do our styling for classes and rehearsals, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of actress when you are given the costume is when you really find the character.
So, everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for designers and professionalism.
You’ve been in your 30s for a long time, have you been in a crisis?
It's all right.
I feel better than ever, I like the 30s.
I find that the woman is made, has experience and tastes life with fewer mistakes.
To me, the biological clock doesn't scare me.
I have done the things I wanted since I was a child and this has given me a lot of inner happiness.
So, are you thinking of being a mother or not?
Of course, I know that I’m going to be a mother because my body asks for it and I also want to be a young mother; I don’t want to lose this.
As for the candidate, I'm not worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and educate him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you are looking forward to several premieres that you filmed last year.
That is the way it is, and I want you to see the light.
I, who am a woman who comes from the theater, I am very impatient and restless, everything I want for now and of course, it can not be.
I look forward to 'The Last Hour' and 'In Search of the Tomb of Christ'.
Let's see what they look like...
A few days ago you debuted on a catwalk with Naomi Campbell, didn't you?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not like I went up to a catwalk to model.
She just called me Naomi Campbell, whom I’ve known for a long time, to invite me to London to participate in a charity parade for her organization ‘Women for a Better World’ and the clothes we exhibited – I took two pieces from our collection for Mango – were auctioned off to raise money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that sweet heart of Naomi.
So many things are said about her that I, who know her, would tell you that many are not true.
Besides, I'm staying with that good part that she's getting involved in.
He asked me to parade for such a noble cause, but if he ever asks me to do the pino, so do I.
For the benefit of third world women, whatever it takes.
Recurring drivers for alcoholemia must install the 'alcolock'
Interior wants the driver with three administrative sanctions for alcoholemia, have to install in his vehicle a system that prevents the start of the drunk vehicle, or if it does not blow.
The initiative was announced last June and is now included in the annual report of the Attorney General of the State, according to which it is a pilot project that will have a duration of one year.
Its purpose is the reinsertion of the driver, so this will also receive a road re-education course.
In addition to the Attorney General’s Office of Road Safety, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Instituto Tecnol<0xC3><0xB3>gico para la Seguridad del Autom<0xC3><0xB3>vil Foundation (FITSA) will participate in the experience.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of motorists reported more than once for driving drunk again pick up the car.
The alcolock would avoid it since it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not blow abscesses; or when a concentration of alcohol is detected is higher than allowed.
Its cost is more than 1,000 euros and would run on account of the sanctioned.
In this sense, a study conducted in the US in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduce infringements by up to 65% during the first year of deployment.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people each year.
The measure is subject to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address those behaviors before they result in criminal offenses.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be done by ordinary means, and yet the necessary reform by criminal means requires reform in an organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial mode, although it has already been experimentally deployed in some industrial and public service vehicles.
Precisely tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on a PSOE initiative in which it is proposed to install this system on school buses, as has been done in France.
In Mexico and without 'peep-toes'
At 5.40 p.m. on schedule, the Spanish Air Force aircraft in which the Princes of Asturias were travelling landed in the Presidential Hangar at Benito Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun was retreating but its rays still forced to use the hand as a visor to watch the real couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other authorities.
Hours earlier he had asked the taxi driver if he knew that the Spanish Princes were visiting the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very good, then you can't go to the airport to charge at that time... she's from here or so...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexican press does know very well who the Princes of Asturias are and the importance of the trip.
There are many waiting in the airport hangar glued to the red carpet and to a military fence formed by 27 marines who interpret the salute of honors.
The Prince appears smiling, dressed in navy blue, and she, the Princess, melena in the wind, very sober, does not use her usual 'peep-toes', perhaps she had been told that in the DF threatened storm.
They give a smile and a escutcheon to the photographers before moving on to the room where the official entourage is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where they are staying, one of the four largest in the city, a reporter from Mexican television awaits them.
The best-endowed award in fashion
There may be no place in the world more appropriate to present a fashion award, than Paris and there may not be a more exquisite and bont live designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Bot<0xC3><0xB3>n-Mango Fashion Awards, to enhance the international projection of new fashion talents.
It is endowed with a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at her designs in the Mango shop window at 54 Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost cried with emotion.
By the way, it is the second largest store of the firm in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, coupled with the desire to thank the designer Valentino for presiding over the jury of the competition, ended up in a luxury dinner at Paris’s Opéra Garnier.
With the proximity of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, looked even more spectacular.
Nati, heartbroken and heartbroken, by the recent death of her brother, put on a suit from the House and a few props from ELAH, which cut her breath, and from the arm of her son Luis - a cannon nearly two meters long - accompanied Valentino in the presidency of his dinner tribute.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, did the honors and is so gentleman that he ended up, next to the Baron of Rotchil, without a jacket, because both had lent them to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who came to the store with pants and shirt - of her own design - and for dinner she was transformed into a black long sexy dress, was thrilled when on the night walk through the opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, we were taught the ballet rehearsal room and she, remembering other times, grabbed one of the bars and made a 'bitch'.
Inés Sastre did not stay for the walk through the palace dependencies, but before he taught us on the mobile phone photos of his son.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the view with the presence of Olivier Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nez - another canyon that travels by motorcycle - and by John Travolta, who arrived at the intercontinental hotel in Paris, with his sheets, his towels and having previously ordered, that there would be no odors in his room.
Stars under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, that's life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget the chaotic and frantic everyday life.
And if that were not enough, they are all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock almost punishes when it rings every morning at 7 a.m., but it is even worse to imagine yourself wrapped up in the hectic pace that today’s life imposes.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
But there are not one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and disconnection problems with the world of work.
No, the number amounts to, nothing more and nothing less, than 1001.
Aside from yoga positions, classic massages or spa treatments, Susannah Marriott brings together in the pages of a book a whole 'menu' of possibilities adapted to the taste and minutes of each.
The anti-stress play is called '1001 Ways to Relax' and its calmness will reach the bookstores by the hand of the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is not possible to achieve tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relationships, this 'manual' denies such a belief.
In addition, it offers other procedures such as being in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline no longer runs through your veins to restore your body’s balance and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, disconnect your mind and focus on reading.
Talking in Sleep
Some children talk at night.
I am not talking about those who wake up very awake telling us something that happened the day before, but children who talk while they are asleep.
The first time it happens, you may get scared, but it doesn’t really matter.
It is a benign sleep disorder called somnilochia.
It is quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one has been told that he spoke at night.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in a lifetime for example associated with an episode of high fever), or more periodically (every day, once a week, once a month...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There is no single cause that determines its appearance.
They are often related to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night terrors, nocturnal enuresis (making yourself sleepy) or sleepwalking, but it doesn’t have to be that way.
As we have already mentioned above, they can also be associated with very high fevers, stressful situations or overexcitement.
However, it is a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be that he speaks in a quiet tone of voice, loose words, a murmur or the opposite (crying, crying, long speeches...).
In cases where the manifestation is very intense, it is advisable to observe the child and consult with a specialist, to check if there is any issue that is generating a lot of anxiety and gives him a way out.
We have said that it is a benign disorder, so it has no treatment, unless it is associated with another sleep disorder that can be treated (for example, if it is associated with sleep apnea or a stressor).
What can be done is to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to excite the child too much before going to sleep.
So look for quiet games and avoid programs or TV series that are scary or a little violent.
With very nervous children who find it hard to relax, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain some inner calm.
This will help the child to have a quieter sleep.
Once the sleepy nights appear, try to keep calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will not remember anything that has happened.
Useful tips
Don't wake him up.
It is useless, because he is not conscious, and you will break his sleep.
Even though he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's resting.
Remember that if you are very anxious during several episodes, you should consult or find out what is causing so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he is saying (which is not usual), do not fall into the temptation to interrogate him to sound out information.
You will get nothing, because being asleep is not conscious as to organize your thought.
In addition, you will hear what he says, but you do not know what he is dreaming to say, so be very careful how you interpret the information and the conclusions you draw.
Never tell the child that you can interrogate him at night to find out his secrets.
Not even a joke.
That generates a lot of anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s not a bad thing, it’s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern at last!
The football club, Illhaeusern, finally found its way to victory on their pitch after a long period of shortage.
Without having made a good match, the team created many goal chances and was able to score a goal to win the match.
The pace was not very constant during this encounter in which the aggressors had difficulty expressing themselves.
After a first attempt by Captain Kauffmann who razed the squadron with a long shot, Illhaeusern was almost going to take the "power" and turn Fonderflick away, then with Hirn up, Romain with the toe or also Diebold came to prevent Dannemarie's defense.
In front, we did not let the midfielder pass and left only Riahi in the attacking position.
The start of the second half was crucial, first with two goals from Riahi and Temporary for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening score for the Illhousiens with the goal from Marais, well placed to pick up the ball rejected in a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the scorer Illhousiens will not be able to enjoy his happiness for a long time and will be forced to return to the locker room a dozen minutes later and thus leave his teammates in numerical inferiority.
But Dannemarie will not take advantage of the opportunity and will not be a problem for the eleven ilhousiens who stepped back a little to "compress" their defense, except in the last few seconds of the game during which, after a major foul, the ball passed very close to the cross-field.
Sarkozy Finds Angry Fishermen
Before taking off for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will tour Britain.
In the face of the demonstration of resistance from fishermen who strongly disturbed the entrances of several Breton and Norman ports last Monday, the President of the Republic decided to go last Tuesday morning to the port of Guilvinec, in the Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re, to find there its representatives.
They promised to welcome him " in a constructive spirit " and expect him " to come with concrete proposals " .
This presidential visit coincides with the general meeting of the " crisis committee " set up by the Breton fishermen to take action against the rise in oil prices, which sets a record at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.14 per litre.
According to Elysee spokesman David Martinon, the president “will discuss with them solutions that can be imagined to help their companies to become competitive again and to save the conditions of jobs and remuneration of sailors.”
The fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy on firm footing.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out operations to reduce traffic in the Morbihan and Calvados, which have caused traffic jams of almost 10 km.
The port of Quiberon has also been blocked, but connections to Belle-<0xC3><0xAE>le have not been halted.
A "filter barrier" has been put in place on the Quiberon peninsula.
The sailors already showed their determination on Monday by burning, by scratching at dawn, tires and wooden pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest, and Lorient, while demonstrations took place in Concarneau or Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bous remained in the port, or in Le Havre, where some twenty ships blocked the movements of the merchant ships.
The fishermen of La Turballe and Croisic, in the Loire-Atlantique region, stopped in the afternoon the blockade of the important refinery Total de Donges.
The fishermen of Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting that will take place at the ministry to think about possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the " crisis committee " will have to think on Tuesday about the development of the movement and its participation in the planned meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the national fisheries committee, which did not support their move.
"The strike will continue " because " the fishermen did not leave " and " they do not want to move to Paris ", announced for example Liliane Cariou, the chairman of the Lorient fishing committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on diesel, currently pay about 50 cents per liter but consider that the financial equilibrium point of a ship can be reached only with a diesel with a price of less than 0.30 euros per liter.
The Magnificent Paul Newman
The unforgettable performer of " Two Men and a Fate " has died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and also Sam Mendes welcomed the film legend and committed actor, Paul Newman, who has died at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its delivery forecasts for 2008
The Brazilian aeronautics company has 215 aircraft delivered this year despite the threats of recession weighing on the world economy.
The world’s fourth aircraft manufacturer, Embraer, maintains its delivery forecasts for 2008 with 215 aircraft delivered, Embraer President Frederico Fleury Curado said.
During the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer relies heavily on the Chinese market particularly to sell aircraft ranging from 30 to 120 seats.
Today, Embraer delivered 41 devices to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG intends to sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which has been bailed out by U.S. monetary authorities, plans to sell more than 15 percent of its assets with the goal of repaying its $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is willing to study the sale of most of its services beyond its international life insurance and retirement insurance in the United States.
AIG’s board of directors met Sunday afternoon to review possible sales, according to the Financial Times.
No confirmation could be obtained from AIG.
Assets from which AIG intends to divest include its air leasing subsidiary, International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in insurer Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the Financial Times adds.
No final decision has been made on these sales, according to the Financial Times.
AIG must quickly liquidate to repay its $85 billion loan granted to it by the Federal Reserve at the risk of seeing the U.S. authorities take 80% of its capital, diluting it with the proper ratio among current shareholders.
Analysis of the historic session of the Paris Stock Exchange
The New York Stock Exchange accused a historic fall on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson’s plan to save banks: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, a loss never seen on the stock market of nearly 800 points, and the Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index fell from 777.68 to 10,365.45 points.
In terms of points, the most significant drop in its history (684.81 points) had been recorded in the past on September 17, 2001, the day on which exchanges resumed after the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The technologically dominant Nasdaq index fell by 199.61 points to 1,983.73 and the Standard & Poor's 500 expanded index by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1,106.55, according to the definitive figures of the closure.
Already depressed by the crisis at the beginning of the session, Wall Street sank after the unexpected rejection by the House of Representatives of the plan to save the banks that would have allowed to regain some stability in the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favor, representatives denied U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson the means he asked for.
About two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
“That’s not a good signal sent to the market, which sees Congress unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
"This shows to what extent the market had this plan," added Lindsey Piegza, fearing that a project adopted within several days would come "too late."
“If the project is really dying ... the Fed and other central banks will quickly take over (the U.S. central bank, the Network N.) to manage the crisis, which would further tighten credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, head of economics and finance at Global Insight.
And further accentuating the sense of urgency, " every day that passes announces the fall of a financial institution " in the United States, underlined Mrs. Piegza.
After the bankruptcy of Washington Mutual last Friday, authorities organized the purchase of Wachovia’s banking activities by its rival Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis accelerated dramatically, prompting emergency interventions to the benefit of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, which shows that markets are facing “not only a crisis in the US but a global crisis,” the FTN Financial analyst added.
The bond market has risen dramatically.
The yield on the 10-year treasury bond fell by 3.632 per cent from 3.827 per cent on Friday afternoon, and the 30-year bond by 4.161 per cent from 4.357 per cent the day before.
Obama, winner of the first televised duel
At the first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House, another took place to find out who has triumphed between John McCain and Barack Obama.
Unsurprisingly, Republican and Democratic campaign headquarters proclaimed their own victory in this televised duel that has been followed by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes John McCain’s performance, though honorable, was not “brilliant enough” to allow him to curb his runoff in the five-week presidential election polls.
The Gallup Institute, whose public opinion poll published last Saturday gives Obama a five-point lead (49% versus 44% for McCain), says it’s the Democrat who did well.
Among the undecided voters, who are the ones counting, Obama came out victorious with 39% of the respondents, while 25% of them concede victory to McCain, according to a CBS poll.
Obama could confirm his lead on Thursday with the expected good performance of his same-candidate member, Jose Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate it.
He has good instincts,” warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
Seven-year-old McCain highlighted his indisputable foreign policy experience, underscoring his opponent’s “na<0xC3><0xAF>vety” on these issues that were at the heart of this first face.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” he accused several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president,” he said.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in Republican televised advertisements.
Obama stressed that he represented the future.
Without bewildering, it was concise and precise.
He enhanced his ability to make good decisions, and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
“McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done so,” he replied, this weekend, a Democratic television ad that reproached the Republican for not having considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on Americans.
“During the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you,” Obama said in front of 20,000 people who had gathered for an election rally in North Carolina in a rainstorm.
He did not pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers." "Financial defeat clearly favors Obama, who is considered by Americans to be the most capable of saving the economy that is on the brink of precipice.
“Next week could be a decisive episode,” said Sen. Charles Schumer, an influential Democrat.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s “good economic instincts” to those of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster “is the final consequence of eight years of poor economic policy implemented by George Bush and sustained by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming that he would nevertheless reduce taxes by 95 percent of Americans despite the Wall Street outbursts, the Illinois senator also noted that the realization of eventual energy independence of the country thanks to the promotion of renewable energies was his first priority, with the creation of a safety and health system.
McCain wants to build a park of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Prudently, both candidates sidestepped issues relating to the $700 billion (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted yesterday afternoon by Congress and extremely unpopular.
“In Minsk, have you noticed the elections in Minsk?”
Young people and opponents demonstrated last Sunday afternoon in the main square of the Belarusian capital to reject in advance the results of the legislative.
A few hundred Belarusians gathered Sunday afternoon from the close of polling stations in Minsk’s central square to protest against the fraudulent nature of the legislation.
While no results had yet been announced, numerous young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, he has to resign".
Some acknowledge not having voted: “for what, since they will do what they want with my vote,” says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime that put foreign observers in a good mood in order to renew contact with the European Union is willing to make a democratic change.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian leaders and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if these elections are considered clean for observers.
They were not, according to the opposition.
"We have been placed next to the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the counting of votes," lamented Iouri Potemkine, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous regrouping of twelve parties.
" It is a cosmetic change," said Alexandre Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, "because the important thing is who counts the votes, and in our house, the executive branch.
If some members of the opposition enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed but not elected.
“But your entry into parliament can mean appearances on television, meetings in the regions, and bills.”
The opposition must therefore enter the political game because " dialogue with the European Union must begin.
Because if our economy, which has many debts to Russia, goes into crisis, and if we do not reform, we run the risk of becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent.”
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which followed the electoral process, will not recognize the validity of the vote.
He stressed that the participation figures seemed too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of voters in Minsk) favored manipulations.
" Have you noticed the elections? Ask Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five members of the opposition to the parliament, those who are best suited to power.”
The silence of the night returns again in the square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate themselves on their success.
The interview - Blood is safe again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary of its foundation yesterday, and its president, Francine Décary, was right to rejoice, because Héma-Québec has once again become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And above all, it regained the public’s trust that had been seriously wavered by the contaminated blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As is known, national blood supplies administered by the Canadian Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service have been contaminated by Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and Hepatitis C virus during the 1980s.
In the face of this drama and public discontent, the Government of Canada conducted a public survey in February 1994, chaired by Judge Horacio Krever, which aimed to clarify the circumstances that had led to such a tragedy and to make recommendations to prevent such a disaster from reproducing.
While Judge Krever was late in presenting his relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that aimed to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this mission.
As a result of the Gélineau and Krever reports, two suppliers have been created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Quebec and the Canadian Blood Society to supply all other provinces and both territories.
" In 1998, when Héma-Québec began its activities, almost 38% of people still had confidence in the blood system in Quebec, Décary recalls.
The situation was discouraging.
Having made many efforts to improve the safety of blood products and a lot of work over the years that followed, we have regained public confidence,” he says before proudly stating that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Quebec population had successively confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary recalls, however, that “trust is something extremely fragile.”
Since its establishment on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At that time, we witnessed the birth in Europe of numerous cases of the human variant of mad cow disease, a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says Décary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
Then we rely on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, according to which when we do not know it and when a serious disease can emanate from it, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, we introduce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, we denied the blood of people who had stayed in the UK for more than a month since 1980.
But, a few years ago, it has been proven beyond any doubt that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode showed us that the precautionary principle that was applied made sense.”
In 1999, a much more sensitive technique for HIV detection appeared on the market: nucleic acid tests that allow to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against the virus, on which the tests used so far were based.
Nucleide acid tests allowed us to shorten the period between the time the person has been infected and the time when the first viruses can be detected in the blood by our techniques, the specialist explains.
We were able to reduce this period by less than a week.
We thus substantially reduce the risk that certain donors will be infected without knowing it and that we will not be able to detect them.
These improvements significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS through a blood transfusion.
Today, one person in 12 million is at risk of receiving HIV-contaminated blood.
“That means 12 million blood products will have to be distributed before someone is infected with HIV.
As Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood products each year, it will be more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission by a blood product occurs.
I think that you can receive or prescribe a blood transfusion today to recover health without worries,” says the head of the management of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
It is never known which pathogen might emerge in the system.
Last year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Reunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted by an insect in the blood.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant,” Dr. Décary pursues before stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also provide for a sufficient supply.
“Needs are increasing as the population ages.
Since the most aggressive anti-cancer treatments, patients often need an injection of red blood cells or platelets.
Aging of the population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average regroups only 3% of Quebecers eligible for blood donation.
All people in good health, 18 years of age and who meet the eligibility criteria can donate blood every 56 days, that is six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who propose their blood are not accepted, because they suffer from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they traveled to a country where malaria reigns, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3%, we managed to maintain an inventory that covered the needs of hospitals.
The hardships are very rare.
But members of this network of donors need to be renewed as they get older and can no longer donate their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood, but above all to hold them back and encourage them to be regular donors.
Since current life is very unrestrained, we rarely find the time to spend an hour donating your blood,” says Francine Décary.
With a budget of $297 million annually, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products, but also human tissues, including bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for large burns.
These tissues are analyzed, transformed and frozen before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Quebec.
The umbilical cord that was once considered biomedical waste is filled with a blood-rich stem cell that can be used to treat serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated a few weeks ago, putting on the bench our thousandth sample of umbilical cord blood and are expected to take out more than a thousand of these per year.
We would have to start proposing it for grafts early next year,” says Dr. Décary who describes this cord blood-taking program as very popular.
“Many moms are disappointed that they can’t enjoy this,” as Héma-Québec doesn’t have the resources to propose this complex and expensive program in all Quebec hospitals.
Softball - The Impact in the Semi-Finals
The Montreal Impact qualified for the semifinals of the USL First Division knockout series, thanks to a 3-1 (4-3 overall) win at the expense of the Seattle Sounders, yesterday, during the second and decisive game of the quarter-final series, at Saputo Stadium.
The midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th minute of the game.
After the first time without a goal from anywhere, midfielder David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many goal chances.
Roger Levesque was the only one who knocked out Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Recall that during the first game of the round-robin series, on Friday, the Impact had suffered a 2-1 defeat at Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the Seattle suburb.
The Impact will be measured against the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday afternoon in Minnesota, the Thunder lost 3-1 in the back-to-back game to take it 4-3, but the Whitecaps nevertheless conceded in the semifinals by 5-4.
The Impact is set to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short – Kovalev’s winning goal
The number one Canadian trio is ready to start the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn encouraged the attack in a 3-2 win from the Canadian to the free throws barrier against the Florida Panthers last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the first star of the match, scored a goal, Plekanec accumulated two assists, and Kovalev picked up a pass in this win, the fourth of the Tricolor in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by scoring the only goal.
"I'm not ready yet, I warn the Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play to the maximum in the first half, Guido Carbonneau noted.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a nice ovation."
Charest takes care of the North
The Prime Minister does not rule out launching elections before the end of the year
As soon as the general council of the Liberal Party is finished, Jean Charest went yesterday to Juan-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to get elected during today’s partial election.
Rejecting the limits of our last great northern frontier ": such is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented with visual strength staying on the front lines, at the end of the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Lévis, yesterday.
Behind him, during his speech, images were projected.
They paraded, on three huge screens, spectacular images of hydroelectric reservoirs, mining, Quebec as seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Large media such as during the election period.
The prime minister thinks the election will take place this fall, although he made it clear that his schedule was very full.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth side of a "vision" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a labor agreement with France, an alliance between Canada and Europe and harmonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the Prime Minister's speeches recently, the opening of the North - the northern territory at the 49th parallel - had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North was “a jewel of immense potential”, but did not give a term, investment amounts, or precise priority in future projects.
What could above all be more developed are: particularly hydroelectricity, the forest, but above all the mining sector, doped by the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
The North contains " nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and also diamond," according to Mr. Charest's listing.
This "territory twice as large as France," is our home, it's in Quebec.
Not only is it home to us, but it’s in us,” he insisted, as if to show that he was soliciting a national founding myth.
Quebec was built a lot thanks to its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold rush in Abitibi, Quebec engineering, James Bay.
“It belongs to us, it’s our future,” he added, after taking a theatrical break to contemplate the immense map behind it.
The North, 70% of Quebec’s territory, comprises a part of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during the press conference.
“It is a traditional position that all governments have reiterated.
There is a border line on which they have not agreed for a long time and, when the occasion presents itself, I reiterate that position on the part of the government,” he said.
In addition, "with climate change, we have to rethink our vision of the North," he said, referring to the Northwest Passage, which will open each year due to melting ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the prime minister believes that occupying the territory is a duty.
What about the inhabitants of the territory, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, particularly young people.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former member of the Quebec Ungava party), have already begun consultations with about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Beno<0xC3><0xAE>t Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role began some work.
The prime minister does not rule out an important meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a meeting in which "a common vision will be given".
The development of the North would be in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan "will be concerted, orderly and environmentally friendly," he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as one that is in continuity with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we have thought differently to transform challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a great cocktail to highlight the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s coming to power.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Central Beauharnois in the Adélard-Godbout Reservoir.
“De Godbout, who created HydroQuebec, in Lesage that made the Revolution quiet and the nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourassa that made James Bay our party knew how to forge the future,” said Juan Charest.
In the press conference, he invoked another reference, that conservative, the "Roads to the North" program of John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
On the subject of the Eastmain1a-Ruper hydroelectric reservoir project, Mr. Charest stressed that its commissioning is scheduled for 2012.
"This stays between us, but I expect to be there," he confided to his militants, arousing applause.
Indeed, the prime minister, who said in April that elections would not take place in 2008 and certainly not in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of launching a vote this fall, which the law allows.
It stresses that its schedule is nevertheless full, particularly because of a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York York summit.
The weekend general council provided the Liberal chief with a platform containing nationalist resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " that had no problems in being accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec in particular demanded recognition of the " specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Council and to have the right of veto over the decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we welcomed the great lines of the Northern Plan with skepticism.
The head of the Quebec party, Pauline Marois, highlighted the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, coming to power in 2003, renounced its application.
If he had done so, "we would have made progress today," said Mrs Marois alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (vote held today), Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise Mercure.
The Democratic Action of Quebec seemed to support the government’s adoption of a Northern Plan.
"But what is desired is that this is not just a show," said leader Sebastien Proulx, replacing Mario Dumont, who is returning from vacation today.
Letras - The Untouchables
It's Mr. Vic Toews, former minister of "Justice" (oh, irony!) in the Harper cabinet, who was allowed last summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "shame" for Canada.
Dishonor this woman who fought relentlessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration what she says about the relations between the Prime Minister and Stephen Harper.
We are in front of a government that is the only one, among all the Western countries involved, that has not repatriated its national that is locked up in the Guant<0xC3><0xA1>namo concentration camp.
It is a government that in no way takes into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young teenager when the facts that are recriminated to him occurred.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada signed the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and lets a child soldier live in inhumane conditions.
The only one who has a false justice to assess the guilt of the accused.
Recall that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, support the repatriation of Omar Khadr in order to benefit from a fair trial in Canada.
It is this government that closes its eyes to torture: it cares little that a young adult is psychologically destroyed, no doubt forever after so many years of exaggerations.
We don’t realize that yet, but we are witnessing at this moment an insidious erosion of our rights, our freedom and our “democracy,” that’s the word Harper keeps repeating and it doesn’t make sense.
The time has come when no more morals exist: we can mistreat, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen as the hitherto minority head of government wants (what will happen after October 14?).
Many voters believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government renounced what it did to the reputation and dignity of our country.
Mr. Toews the shame is caused by this resignation and nothing more.
Free Review - Barrick Gold's Orwellian Speech
In its September 17 edition, Le Devoir published a letter from Mr. Patrick J. Garver, vice president and director of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Following an Orwellian logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world’s largest goldsmith company attempted a six-million-euro defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house in order to provoke a “transparent public debate”.
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of defamation persecutions, but the law.
Unsurprisingly, this fundamental difference is completely concealed by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, would the best way to conduct a public debate be to harm anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his own?
The outcome of the lawsuit is of little importance; the authors and the publisher of the book Noir Canada will have to spend considerable sums in order to prepare their defense and fight, with very unequal weapons, against an army of lawyers held by the mine’s almost bottomless pockets.
The tactic, in these unequal struggles, is often to ruin the defendants in order to impose a friendly settlement that will stifle the opposition as well as scare anyone who dares to look at the issue again.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is before public opinion that he would have had to present his vision of the facts.
Contrary to what is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, debates in Canada are usually done by changing ideas and not by rattling.
It was enough for the miner to open her books, her files and establish a real debate, through newspapers, the media, publications and the funding of independent search teams that could have clarified the issue.
But Barrick Gold does not seem to trust public opinion and rejects petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Could Mr. Garver possibly explain how he can ask for a "public" debate by disregarding his views?
According to the Vice-President, it seems that this word designates only highly paid lawyers and not all Canadians; that represents a very limited view of the concept.
In a democracy, detractors also have the right to speak.
What Barrick Gold doesn’t understand – or doesn’t want to understand – is that the public that supports the authors and editors of Noir Canada does so primarily because it rejects the mine’s brutal manner.
This audience is willing to listen to Barrick and judge him, but based on civilized changes of argument, and not within the framework of what many people perceive as a stalking-bitch (pursuing the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just filed a request with respect to the authors of Noir Canada urging them not to use this word anymore).
In addition to Mr. Garver’s surreal speech, the Barrick Gold process is a direct attack on the freedom of university search and truth, essential for all democratic societies.
He denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that form the basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that displease the rich companies of this world in a country like Canada, under pain of many persecutions, who will be able to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, he could do so by following the scientific standards used by the authors of Noir Canada.
You have a right of reply.
The university world, to which we belong, has long been able to manage debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
Barrick Gold’s excessive persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, he does not want to have a transparent debate.
It’s a loss for the university world, but also for the public debate in Canada, and it’s time for governments to put in place devices that limit this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Rescue Operation - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republicans and Democrats, finally reached an agreement yesterday on the most important economic bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan that aims to stem the financial crisis that has rocked Wall Street for months has yet to be confirmed by both Houses of Congress.
It foresees in particular: better control by the elected representatives of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of public money invested, new provisions to contain the number of houses embargoed the lack of payment, as well as a right of control over the salaries paid to the managers of the rescued companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi, and Republican Representative at the negotiating table Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, at the end of a two-day marathon of negotiations.
“We are making great progress toward a deal that will be effective in the markets,” Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said.
“Everything has been done to cover up the economy and ordinary Americans in the face of the current crisis on Wall Street,” she said.
“It’s the bottom line: if we don’t do this, the trauma, chaos, and disruption to Americans’ daily lives will be immense,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had ended very quickly in the last few hours because they feared the effect that a new failure would have on investors’ mood.
The last hour they had set was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the US presidential election, who have been late to the negotiations, were rather favorable to the agreement, not forgetting to express their dissatisfaction with being forced to reach this extremity.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama was given certain provisions to reach the agreement, particularly one that would allow the owners to keep their home and the salary of the leaders of the surviving companies by the state.
" When taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary action because of the irresponsibility of some, there is no need to congratulate them.
But these measures are necessary,” he said on American television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, interviewed on another network to see if he would vote for the proposed plan, responded that: “I’d like to see the details, but I hope to vote for it.”
“The important points I read [show] that it is something that we will have to digest and with which we will be able to move forward.
He said the option of doing nothing is not acceptable.”
The $700 billion plan aims to buy taxpayers’ money, dubious debts, risky and unsaleable assets from U.S. financial institutions.
It comes after 14 months of a crisis caused by the bursting of a real estate bubble that first led to the sinking of mortgage risk credits before spreading to other more common forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and causing a liquidity freeze and an unbundling of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected Republicans who had the first draft of the agreement changed last week.
We believe we have come out of the stalemate since the Democrats accepted that certain “toxic” assets of struggling companies are only insured by the government, rather than bought.
In order to put an end to the harshness for everyone in Congress, we also added a provision stipulating that if the government had to assume losses for five years with this program, it could impose new rates that would purport to help it recover money.
The new plan provides for the payment of a first part of $250 billion to which an additional $100 billion may be added if the president deems it necessary.
The payment of another $350 billion would have to be confirmed by another vote on the part of Congress.
Instead of his help, Washington will get shares in the relief companies that will pay him dividends in the event of profits and that he will be able to resell when the storm is over.
The federal government will have the option of delaying the embargo procedures on homes obtained with real estate loans under this plan, as well as setting limits on remuneration and cash compensation paid to the managers of companies affected by the crisis.
The architects of the plan would like to see it submitted to the vote of the House of Representatives from today and to that of the Senate next Wednesday.
Despite all your efforts, you are still not sure that your plan will be approved.
Some people continued to protest this project yesterday, both on the part of Republicans and Democrats.
Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House Finance Committee, told his voters that “with all the evidence, Washington doesn’t want to understand.”
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are solutions.
But not what it means to profit from taxpayers.”
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, who is animator of a small group in Congress, presents the problems differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred economics professors, including three Nobel Prize winners, wrote to us to tell us: We ask Congress not to rush and carefully examine the path to be taken," he said.
At this very moment, in Europe, we once again had proof of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion dollars).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg had been necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was giving up buying its bankrupt competitor since it lost 2 billion euros ($2.9 billion) during the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest European banks and 10 largest insurers.
“This is not money lost,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said yesterday.
Instead, we regain a right to vote in the bank and influence.
It is precisely something that savers and families will appreciate now that times are uncertain.”
During this time, on the other side of the English Channel, the British government seemed to want to nationalize another bank suffering from the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all outstanding loans at the Bradford and Bringley bank and more than 41 billion euros ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander announced yesterday that it would buy the branches and bank accounts of the British bank.
Bradford and Bringley Bank would be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government would have to nationalize from the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a Committed Icon
His blue eyes represented his triumph for so long.
Had the American actor with a charming smile been freed from his narcissistic side?
Yes and no.
His modesty, sensibility, and a talent that was evident will also have taken him away from the register of power that the true sacred monsters have.
What a great runner!
Paul Newman, who died Friday at the age of 83 from lung cancer at his Connecticut ranch, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the glittering years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, who looked very much like him and who was long regarded as a rival in cinema, more prudent in his play, certainly more fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the outbreak of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often makes magnificent children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without excessive ego, last quality mark.
Because he projected an entire country in love with the self-made man, the wounded Pacific War fighter, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, then attended Actor's Studio in New York, before succeeding in theater, television and soon in film.
This man who campaigned for civil rights was also the car driver who qualified second in the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
The secret sides of this secret star, discreet and committed, allergic to the scandals of the world of the show that we do not know very well disappear with him.
He is an honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The death of Paul Newman caused vertigo to moviegoers this weekend as their big roles clashed on the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of the seventh-century American art in perpetual motion parades through it.
Many memories come back to mind as the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gata on Tennessee Williams' adapted zinc roof in 1958.
Closer to us (1990), we evoke his sensitive Mr. Bridge, disturbed by a marriage that did not fulfill all his promises.
Others like Paul Newman have gone down in film history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delinquent, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Marked by Hate), by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean, repeated after his death, who truly launched Newman in 1956.
This cute manga in the sumptuous film The Sting, Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
Bitter and vengeful billiards player in Robert Rossen's magnificent film The Hustler (1961), he will repeat the character in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earned him his only Oscar in 1987 among nine nominations.
This face that changes with the years, it was him.
Still him.
Times change during his career.
He is best known for George Roy Hill’s Slap Shot (1977) in Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
His fans saw him again in 1994 in The Hudsucker Proxy of the Coen brothers.
With a final role as the godfather of the Irish Mafia in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003, the curl was curled.
Contrary to several film legends who soon abandoned the career, Newman stayed a lot in the film world, denouncing Hollywood, its golds, its splendors and its concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier viewed it, with humor, "as a challenge that lives on in " underplaying " and that judges its performance too supported.
The profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman to whom the roles came for a long time without doing anything.
However, he less often played the role of a young gallant than a marginal one: neurotic, alcoholic, bastard or desperate, whose traits reflected rebellions.
As a director, Newman revealed sides his true pudicial sensibilities not very well known.
His film Raquel, Raquel, in 1968 (according to the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the lead role, described a female portrait of melancholy.
He who lost his son Scott to overdose dedicated his film Harry and Son to him in 1984, a work of shame and sadness.
Among the numerous tributes that were unleashed yesterday for Newman, his great friend and former comrade-in-arms Robert Redford (who had worked together on The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) stated, very sadly, "my life and my country were better because of their existence."
Generosity, love of existence are important traits of the deceased actor.
On the other side of his legendary career, he also hides a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, an anti-Hollywood protestor.
We will have seen much of his face reign over the cans of vinaigrette sauce, sauces, cookies and other foods, judging this method as a method of bad taste, although it began as a gag.
The profits from these sales were given to his Foundation for Children in Difficulty.
Newman, rather than content with his myth, will have committed himself to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing these phrases: "Always and to the end, your father was incredibly grateful for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there.”
And a privilege for us to have followed the career of such a lucid and generous American artist.
In short, a model citizen.
What were they producing at the Zuschlag &amp; Co. invoicing factory?
Very soon, on October 8, the criminal proceedings will begin against J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag and his accomplices.
The politician and his accomplices are accused of committing fraud of significant damage, in a business manner, continuously and in an organized manner in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor’s Office, the funds obtained in public tenders were used for their own purposes, often justifying the fulfillment of the tasks with false invoices.
The public funds and that of the municipalities - in total about 65 million HUF - stopped partly in the treasury of the organization Fiatal Baloldal and partly in the pocket of private individuals.
The method, which was disclosed by the researchers as well, was to justify the collection of funds obtained in public tenders with false invoices behind which there was no actual execution, the different associations never fulfilled their assumed obligations.
According to the indictment, most of the invoices were fake.
For this they obtained the studs in the market of the District of J<0xC3><0xB3>zsefv<0xC3><0xA1>ros and the circular stamps were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of which company the forged invoice was to be made was decided, among others, on that tour of the Upper Balaton Region where J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag sent Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados.
The latter confessed that for this purpose he had to choose hostels and restaurants.
He asked for an invoice for his consumptions and these served as a model to prepare the invoices that they presented, among others, in the competitions of the Ministry of Youth and Sports Affairs, in the Ministry of Social and Labor Affairs, as well as in the City of the Capital.
These invoices were mostly signed by Istv<0xC3><0xA1>n Lados and his accomplice Andr<0xC3><0xA1>s <0xC5><0x90>ri, who according to our information rather wrote the reports necessary to obtain the public subsidies.
During one of his "study trips" Lados chose a brewery.
According to two invoices issued in 2003 by Zuschlag and its accomplices, this gastronomic center provided food for a group of ninety people from the Biztos Pont Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let Association.
However - according to the manager of the center - so many people do not fit in that place at once.
Similarly, the bill issued in the summer of 2002 for the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Foundation - later called Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt to Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért - was full of formal and contextual errors.
For a hostel in the town of Badacsonytomaj had only three rooms and more than ten people could not stay there in one night, however on the bill consisted one hundred and thirty people.
But the big fanciful bill makers also exaggerated when they pointed to the Pigal Kft. food center, because in the bookshop of the same - according to the information given to the Prosecutor's Office - there were no documents in the name of Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért and Hopp<0xC3><0xA1>.
Gy<0xC5><0x91>z<0xC5><0x91> Farkas, the company’s manager, informed hvg.hu that when he was summoned by the prosecutor’s office and shown the invoices, he already knew that they were fake documents.
"On the label the name of our company and the NIF appeared in the wrong place."
In addition to the formal problems, he also did not agree that according to the bill a hundred people were accommodated, since they have only eleven rooms in which not so many people fit.
In addition, meals were also included in the bill, while the restaurant has not worked for a long time.
The enthusiastic invoice makers also did not report that the chosen travel agency in Budapest organizes trips abroad exclusively, so that in the cash payment invoice they foolishly indicated as a service a trip within Hungary, which also did not coincide with the practice of issuing invoices from the agency.
In addition, as was known during the investigation, VAT was also included in the document, despite the fact that trips outside the European Union were tax-exempt.
Among other things, the VAT measure was also incorrect in the four documents issued by the Hotel Révf<0xC3><0xBC>l<0xC3><0xB6>p Kft. for the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért foundation, since the services of this company are not charged with a 25 but only with 15 percent VAT, in addition the hotel employees only extended invoices made by machine however the invoice was manual.
In addition, the "senders" made other mistakes as well, such as in the case of a company in which they put on the invoice as an activity carried out the road transport to which - it was known during the investigations of the prosecution - does not make the company founded as an investment consultant.
Also due to formal differences - improper format of the invoice, false stamp - it was known that the invoices issued for Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt to Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alapitv<0xC3><0xA1>ny, for XXI. Sz<0xC3><0xA1>zadi Kultur<0xC3><0xA1>lis Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let and for Biztos Pont are false.
As in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehért<0xC3><0xB3> Sports Camp, whose representatives refused to issue such invoices.
Neither did the counterfeiters pay attention to the fact that when the group of Fiatal V<0xC3><0xA1>rosért Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let ate there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Ny<0xC3><0xAD>regyh<0xC3><0xA1>za was in the process of liquidation, so the person in charge of the liquidation process - according to our information - denied having issued such a document.
Consciously sent out the bills.
Another group of fake bill makers are made up of those who were aware that they had to issue fictitious bills.
The Esely Budapestért Alapitv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifj<0xC3><0xBA> Szocialist<0xC3><0xA1>k, issued an invoice worth about four million HUF on behalf of the Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt Foundation to Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért.
The manager of Collab Kft. - according to the indictment - was persuaded by one of the defendants, Ludovic Gy<0xC3><0xB6>rfi, to issue fictitious invoices.
In the same way he collaborated with Zuschlag and its accomplices Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, which in 2003 provided invoices worth approximately HUF five million to the Jobb J<0xC3><0xB6>v<0xC5><0x91>ért Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny Foundation, the Atlasz Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let Association and the V<0xC3><0xB6>r<0xC3><0xB6>sfeny<0xC5><0x91> Egyes<0xC3><0xBC>let Economic Association without.
There was no movement of capital either, because then they canceled the prepared invoices but forgot to record in their documents this entity.
The next group of fake bill makers includes those who have some connection to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the plaintiff of the Ukrainian manager of the fictional Delta Trio SL based in Budapest, which dealt with the trade in fuels and vehicles.
This company issued numerous invoices worth approximately HUF 18 million in the months of October, November and December 2005 on the sale of computer media.
According to the research data, these invoices were purchased by the Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas, which since September 14, 2005 is under liquidation process.
The manager of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov should have also dispatched the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov acknowledged during the investigation that he issued invoices on behalf of the company for the Atlasz, for the Hoppa and for Egy<0xC3><0xBC>tt to Armadik <0xC3><0x89>vezredért Alapitv<0xC3><0xA1>ny charging the amount himself.
Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were founded by Romanian masons at the express request of Ivan Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually functioned due – according to the defendant – to the fact that they did not receive work.
But he took advantage of these companies, since at the request of his accomplice, lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the company’s registration documents, sent invoices on behalf of the companies for the organizations linked to Zuschlag: for Atlasz and for Y-Generation.
Kubatov on behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 invoices to various entities worth HUF 14.2 million.
The Prosecutor’s Office considered that Kubatov received the VAT and 10% of the amount of the invoices.
That man even took advantage of the Szi-Beri partnership to issue fictitious invoices used in the Biztos Pont contest.
The Y-Generation and Sz<0xC3><0xB6>vetség to Modern Magyarorsz<0xC3><0xA1>gért presented a contest in January 2006 to T<0xC3><0xA1>ncsics Mih<0xC3><0xA1>ly Alap<0xC3><0xAD>tv<0xC3><0xA1>ny (TMA), an entity of public utility of the Socialist Party.
They won HUF 500,000 from the contest, respectively, but did not use the money for the purposes of the contest.
In order not to reveal this, they presented to the TMA five fictitious invoices received from the Works Team Kft.
These were the invoices found during the registration of the office that <0xC3><0x81>rp<0xC3><0xA1>d Kemecsei had at the headquarters of the Ministry of Education.
Some of the defendants will likely report in the trial – as they did in the Prosecutor’s Office – the course of the falsification of the invoices.
The most interesting may be the confession of the main defendant J<0xC3><0xA1>nos Zuschlag himself, if he decides to dismantle everything.
For his confessions so far have not been very detailed and although he repeatedly promised to talk about everything, this has not done so until the present.
The question is: what interest does he have to do it?, because perhaps in exchange for the return of most of the money - fifty million HUF - the socialists came to an agreement with him so that Zussi would assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days could even be offended, since to relieve his prison conditions he requested house arrest, but was repeatedly denied.
While the numerous perpetrators of far superior economic crimes, who never returned the money, walk freely or at least can wait in their own home for the sentence, he has no chance for that.
Psychology of Overlays: Why Do We Spend More Money?
Auctioneers are likely to spend more money and overvalue the product.
Neurologists and economists at the University of New York discovered the neurological-economic basis of this known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to the study, which appeared in the journal Science, people do not want to lose in competitions such as eBay auctions, so they prefer to pay even an excessive price.
The scientists attempted to establish the neurological scheme of this "game" through experimental auctions.
One of the groups of volunteers played the lottery, the other participated in an auction and meanwhile the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment were examined by means of the functional magnetic resonance system (fMRI).
In both games the participants could earn money, but during the auctions, where it is fundamental to bet more than the other, losing the game intensified the functioning of the complex called stratum located under the cerebral cortex.
This area of the brain, in addition to many other functions, plays a role in the auto-reward mechanism of the nervous system.
Thus, according to scientists, the increase in bets is explained as a prevention so as not to provoke an intense reaction of the stratum.
To substantiate their theory, the economists of the scientific group also conducted a financial follow-up study.
In this experiment, three groups bet against one person under different circumstances.
The control group was simply told the actual value of the product in question, and its members bet.
Another group was also promised that if they won, they would receive an additional $15 in prize money.
Instead, the third group received exactly $15 before the auction, but in case of losing the auction, the members of the group even lost that money.
Thus the only difference between the two groups was that for one the triumph was highlighted and for the other the failure.
However, checking the neurologists hypothesis, the members of the group that played "against failure" were willing to bet even more than the members of the control group and the "winner" group.
“These results cannot be deduced from any previous economic theory.
For those until now explained the phenomena of auctions only with the joy of winning and with the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped resolve this contradiction between the two theories, so we now come to a third explanation,” said Andrew Schotter, professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
In the world some five hundred million people suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, and in Hungary chronic liver disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of infected people in this country is estimated at one hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many of the sick do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the common name for different liver diseases caused by viruses.
The symptoms are very similar; liver infection and jaundice are characteristic, but their pathogens and diseases are very different.
Hepatitis viruses depending on the pathogen are spread by two main forms: hepatitis A and E through food (e.g. with water or contaminated food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and with body humors (sperm, vaginal humor, saliva).
It is advisable for travelers to protect themselves by vaccine against A and B viruses, against C there are no vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after eating the infected food, manifested by a poor general condition, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After that appear on the skin and on the whites of the eyes jaundice, excrement becomes clear, dark-colored urine and healing can last even two to three weeks.
Every year, one million people worldwide die from liver cancer and cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of the disease.
The main reason for this is that according to calculations, only one in ten infected people receives pharmacological treatment.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: without treatment it can cause liver cirrhosis and even cancer.
Most of the infected do not know that he is sick because this pathological agent gradually destroys liver cells and often the first symptoms appear only 20-30 years later.
Therefore, it is very important early recognition, systematic medical control.
This disease is much more common in three groups: people who had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and those who wear tattoos.
There are currently about 200 million people in the world suffering from chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with routine laboratory monitoring as well, it is worth consulting with your family doctor when experiencing any unknown symptoms.
The disease has a cure if it is discovered in time, it is possible to exterminate the virus from the body, so you can suppress the infection and prevent cancer.
September 30 is World Hepatitis Day, which was first organized in 2004 by organizations representing the sick.
Its aim is to draw attention to the causes of chronic liver infections caused by viruses and to the importance of their premature recognition.
Does it hurt less those who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a calming effect that also alleviated the death of the martyrs of Catholicism.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment: they analyzed that religious belief in how it influences human pain – reported the British newspaper Telegraph.
As part of this unique experiment they applied electric shock to 12 Catholic believers and the same number of atheists, while all were looking at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the human brain scan technique, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to activate that part of their brain that is responsible for regulating pain.
This experiment is the first in a series of researches in which scientists, philosophers and theologians from different departments of the University also participate alongside academics.
The analysis occurred as follows; they fixed a shimmering instrument on the patient’s left hand, which applied electric shock.
The researchers asked the participants of the experiment to fix their gaze on two paintings; the Virgin Mary, a 17th-century work by Sassoferrato and the 15th-century Lady of the Arminian by Leonardo da Vinci.
The researchers hoped that the Virgin Mary show would provoke a certain religious mood among the faithful, while they chose Leonardo’s oil because it was not too different from the other, and thought it had a calming effect.
The patients spent half an hour on an MRI scanner, receiving 20 electric shocks in four successive parts while observing the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics claimed that when they looked at the Virgin Mary they felt “safe” as “protected” people, “they calmed down and peace reigned in their hearts.”
When they looked at the religious picture, they felt 12 percent less pain than when they looked at Leonardo’s work.
The psychologist Miguel Farias who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any image so shocking you can achieve a similar effect with atheists too, you just have to find the right image.
“We should find a portrait of a person they feel very positively about, like a mother or a father,” the psychologist said.
Anglican Bishop Tom Wright celebrated the result of the investigation.
“The exercise of faith should and in many cases does change our personality,” Wright added.
After these formidable results, only one question remains: what effect would it have on the regulation of pain if the faithful were shown the Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of his size?
Would the vision of a high-quality Virgin Mary yield even better results?
You are what you say about yourself
On his tenth birthday, Google can claim: he can be found both in people’s pocket and in the sky above his head; he knows where they spent their vacation, what doctors they visit and what is of interest to them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company’s executives, this is still not enough.
On the other hand, skeptics who make a parallel with the Orwellian vision do not see the essence of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s main goal is to gather as much personal data as possible about its users, and this is necessary to meet the original goals of Google’s founders: “We gather in one system all the information in the world!”
According to the leader of Google, the company, even after ten years of work that turned the world around, is still in the initial phase of the effort to be able to process all the information.
To the question of what is going to happen in five years Schmidt answered thus: I would like Google to be able to answer questions like "What to do tomorrow?" or "What would be the best job for me?" - however, the software will not be able to answer questions seemingly so simple as long as there is not enough information from users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the search keywords, IP addresses and the pages where they went when the search ended are accurately stored during their browsing on the Web.
Thanks for example to Personalized Search that debuted two years ago, users can store their own browsing history, they can re-visit what they were looking for before, what they opened and thanks to this history will generate much more personalized searches - on this same logic will be based the Recommendations, on which the system will offer us products and services based on the preferences defined above and stored.
What will happen if they take advantage of my data against myself, if they collect information about my activities? – ask those users who are concerned about seeing the information monopoly of Google.
In most cases rather the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remorse, fear of punishment, longing for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that not only retain, but in justified cases also cede to third parties all the expressions sought, in these cases there is nothing that protects the personal rights of Internet users.
Perhaps the most debated example of recent times was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, when Google gave the Brazilian government information from its website, called Orkut, to identify pedophiles.
Instead, internet users who care about people’s rights in May were relieved when the company, together with the EFF, the electronic rights advocacy organization, successfully demonstrated before the court that it was right in its dispute with the FBI: according to the ruling, Google will not be forced, by any of the points of the constitution, to request FBI to supply any kind of information.
(At the same time, the federal government managed to get its pretext to strengthen the child protection law passed years ago, about fifty thousand Web addresses and about a thousand searched phrases, but without getting the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of Web pages and keywords of the last two months.)
This is quite contradictory opinion about Google: it is criticized by those who are afraid to provide their personal data because they think that their privacy, their private life is harmed when they start using Google services, and they rebel against it as against the multinational companies of conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and its enthusiastic followers, netizens and users from other countries, see in them the future generation, the "vanguard corporation", not so to its rival, Microsoft, cataloged by its Windows as conqueror of the world, no matter how much they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask users for any identification code, nor money for their applications, the code is open source and the free program package, constantly updated and seems more youthful, more collaborative than the practice of the official software giant.
But it may also be because geeks accurately see the very problematic relationship between people’s rights and the Internet that came about precisely by one of the most mentioned keywords in recent years: Web 2.0.
Web 2.0 is about collaboration, leaving intentional footprints behind us and taking advantage of the available communication channels, and while the measures of these vary individually, the essence remains the same: to show ourselves.
A normal young person can have a profile on numerous collective pages, from Facebook to Shanghai, and can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers a list of their music habits, then these can be included in a tracking system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also have a blog, in which the most recent photos are automatically stored on Flick.
We can know numerous cases from which it turns out that for example the bride, seeing the flow of photographs of the next morning of ordinary friends, finds out with whom she spent the night before her fraudulent boyfriend or can fire the employee of a company because he writes his sincere opinion on his blog about the direction of the company: one thing is for sure, the definition of complete reva life.
A person's "online" life is what she shows of herself - this is the definition that lies behind the behavior of youth today.
And anyone who wants to hide something, or at least pretends to dodge Google’s monopoly, can do so (starting with, for example, the Scroogle that uses Google’s search engine, but leaves no footprints).
There are many people who don’t want to sign up on collective pages to avoid being able to find them, but they can replace Google’s “online” apps, from text-writing software to image-reading and news-reading apps with alternative versions that don’t connect with giant servers or prepare the most perfect profile possible on us.
Public opinion almost openly expects the day Google shows its true face.
The company with its current value of 156 billion dollars is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), the advertising surfaces of AdWords/AdSense threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, while the services that are introduced more and more quickly cause Microsoft not only severe headaches.
Critical observers, however, will find the alarming contradictions too: for example, the top management flatly rejected the employee protest after doubling the price of the company's childcare, considered too expensive the unlimited number of feeding employees, but all this is nothing compared to the fact that in 2006 Google gave in to the pressure of the Chinese government and the company's good news.
One of the internal regulations of the company says that they will not announce any new service in advance, but that only when it was already ready to operate, which if it is certain is that the foreseeable problems of the coming months and years will be able to stir up the world: while some believe that the project of scanning and archive of books and magazines from Google will acquire such dimensions that the company will soon be sued by the courts.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, will provide a good raw material for science fiction writers, the Scroogled, novel by the popular Cory Doctorow, describes in an Orwellian way that future, in which a man only of Google's data can be described alarmingly well.
Two minors helped to erase the fingerprints of the perpetrator of the double murder in the city of Ozd.
Police questioned two minors about the double murder of <0xC3><0x93>zd who, according to reasonable suspicion, helped to erase the traces of the crime, the spokesman of the General Public Order Commissariat of Borsod province said on Tuesday.
The young women acknowledged the crime they were charged with, and are currently accused of the crime.
The two children - according to the information of the Hungarian News Agency it is two girls - will be able to defend themselves in freedom.
For complicity they can receive up to 5 years in prison.
The accused of the double murder of Ozd - a 23-year-old man - has been in pretrial detention since Sunday.
He is accused of murdering several people with premeditation and greed.
During the investigations it was revealed that the 23-year-old owed a large sum to a 53-year-old man.
The defendant did not want to pay his debt, so on Wednesday last week he quoted his creditor to the headquarters of an Ozd company, where he killed him and then also killed the victim’s 9-year-old daughter.
According to reports from MTI, the young man was prepared much earlier to carry out the crime, as he committed the murder with a weapon previously hidden at the crime scene.
The police analyze with an expert the weapon and the circumstances of its use.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange presented an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange offered two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech crowns - for one hundred percent of the shares of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwig Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange confirmed the offer made by the Poles, despite the Czechs having previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is in the hands of the state.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which wants to sell 60 percent of the shares within a few months.
The Czech economic daily E15 reported that the offer of Poles has been the highest among those offered by those interested in the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the Deutsche B<0xC3><0xB6>rse have so far been offered.
Petr Koblic, the head of the Prague Stock Exchange, declared last week that among those interested the worst new owner would be the Warsaw Stock Exchange and did not rule out the possibility that the Prague Stock Exchange would disappear in the future.
Experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at about 5 to 10 billion crowns.
Under the shareholders’ agreement, approximately 90 percent of the shares could be sold.
The majority owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with a stake of approximately 25 percent, followed by Cesk<0xC3><0xA1> Sporitelna Bank with 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European press
The main European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis speak of a "second 11 September".
The global financial catastrophe is due to the U.S. president - according to The Republic of Rome - the president has not even been able to get the support of his own party for the hastily made bill, whose goal is to solve this desperate situation...
Instead of a new “Pearl Habor,” which billionaire investor Warren Buffett was talking about, it’s more correct to talk about a “September 11 second.”
According to a part of the Madrid press, Washington is the scapegoat.
In El Mundo’s opinion, the mistake of the political leadership of the United States was the one that brought the world economy to the edge of the abyss.
The danger of the collapse of the U.S. monetary system is growing, and it will affect the entire world.
Although Bush’s plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote the danger arises that Washington does not offer a political instrument to deal with the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air - just as one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
This threat cannot be ignored, says the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva.
Some states today can still throw life belts at shaky financial institutions, thus saving them from bankruptcy with taxpayers’ money.
But if, like the dominoes, more banks are collapsing, then neither new funds nor new improvisations will be enough.
It is necessary in the long term that the member states of the European Union put aside their nationalist egoism and centralize control over fragmented financial markets.
Financial institutions in crisis received more than 100 billion euros on Monday alone - recalls the Viennese Der Standard, adding that concerns are increasingly real that, as Americans did, European taxpayers will also have to pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has so far not taken seriously the crisis that passes like a cunem through the Old Continent.
The "saviors" will not have to present hundreds of millions of euros immediately, but it would be good if they defined: in what cases is it justified to use taxpayers' funds to avoid a greater evil?
The intelligent car imitates the flight of the bumblebee
What would be the best method to develop technologies to avoid collisions, if not mimicking existing obstacle sensors in nature?
For example, the beekeepers.
In a surprising project presented at CEATEC in Japan, the bumblebees gave the starting point for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collision prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the nature-imitating BR23C robotic car steering system, which was given the characteristics of bumblebees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can dodge all collisions.
During the flight each bumblebee creates its own particular oval space that actually looks a lot like our safety protective capsule - explained in the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, technological director of RP and development and research.
The compound eyes of bumblebees that are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees play an important role.
To copy the function of the compound eyes, the engineers used the laser length measurement system.
This identifies the obstacles in front of the BR23C within a distance of 2 meters, at an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a signal to the microprocessor of the vehicle that immediately transforms into a maneuver to avoid collision.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle imitating the movements of the bumblebees, modifies the direction by rotating the wheels to the necessary extent.
Unlike any system currently in existence, this maneuver is totally instinctive.
“If not, the vehicle robot could not react quickly enough to dodge obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the vehicle robot project.
It must react immediately and instinctively, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable inner layer of the safety protective capsule, in a layer within which all types of collisions are currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bumblebee does to dodge other bumblebees.
This process should be performed at an opening and closing of the eyes.
However, unlike bumblebees, the movement cannot be directed upwards, downwards or diagonally, but can only be two-dimensional and exclusively in the direction of rotation of the wheels.
In this way, instead of the infinite possibilities that exist for the bumblebees to dodge other bumblebees, here they only used as a possibility for the robot of the car rotational movement and acceleration in addition to braking.
The BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries that are lighter and higher in energy density, which means they have a longer service life than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the important thing is the instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, let alone the storage capacity.
This apparatus in every second only has to process some input signals and react as the case may be.
It is not necessary to store this data or react with an instinctive logic based on the data from the previous maneuvers, so it uses only a few tens of kilobytes of memory.
No gigabytes or megabytes are needed.
This is the first step in developing the technology to immediately dodge obstacles, which Nissan estimates will be able to incorporate into mass-produced models within 10 years.
Another possibility for its application is to incorporate the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system to take the driver to his destination, avoiding the obstacles existing in his way.
This precious child has a name.
A written version of the $700 billion financial bailout package has been prepared, which will be implemented in several phases in order to buy bad loans from banks.
In the first phase, half of the money will be spent.
According to East Coast schedule during the new consultations that lasted until after midnight on Saturday, congressional leaders reached an agreement around the $700 billion bailout package in total, after several days of discussion.
We have made significant progress,” said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic president of the U.S. Congress, saying the deal needs only to be formalized in a document.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the finance minister, speaking about the outcome of the compromise said: this program will work and will be efficient but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning it back to the economy’s chariot.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. on Sunday before 8 p.m., according to Washington time (i.e. before 2 a.m. on Monday, according to Central European time), without causing a spectacular jump in the stock markets.
On Monday, the U.S. Congress and then the Senate will vote on a bill called the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.
President George W. Bush on Saturday night consulted with Pelosi and then the White House also celebrated the news about the deal.
“We are pleased with the progress made overnight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy,” White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program is different from the Bush administration’s original proposal to spend all of the $700 billion to buy low-quality credit-fund securities.
Now only half of the $700 billion can be spent, using $250 billion immediately after Congress votes, probably on Monday, of this sum the Ministry of Finance will buy credit-fund securities, of poor grade and the fate of another $100 billion depends on the decision of the president.
This program will be controlled by a special body, in which the president of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The other half of the $700 billion could be spent after a new Congressional decision.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic: it will be able to simultaneously buy bad loans, mortgages and debt securities, as well as other credits of the "poisonous" type as well.
The purchase can be made at auctions or directly - informed competent persons of the ministry.
The law allows affected companies to participate in an insurance program where the financial portfolio guarantees the items of concern, for which the companies will pay the amount corresponding to the foreseeable damages.
Henry Paulson stated: The law thus secures the necessary financial means, which can even reach 700 billion dollars to meet the urgent needs of the American financial system, whether it is the purchase of bad financial means, their insurance or the prevention of risks that could lead to the collapse of some large financial institutions.
We do everything necessary to be ready to introduce the law as soon as they sign it.
Instead, the heads of the banks that are in trouble and expect state aid will be able to count on the official limitation of their compensation, which the American slang term simply calls golden parachutes.
Only in certain cases will the payments be limited, in addition the limitations depend on the form of aid of the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of an auction, an extra tax will be imposed for the gold parachutes, unless the failed head of the bank retires.
By buying bad loans directly, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the bosses’ compensations are not exaggerated.
In addition to the above, the existing gold parachute contracts are not going to be changed, the limitations refer only to the new contracts to stimulate participation in the program.
This is the first case in U.S. history that a legal limitation on the revenue of CEOs will be in place, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the congressional committee responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire shares in the banks participating in the program, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, since ultimately they will even be able to make profits with the transaction as soon as the economy recovers and with it the bank.
Under the bill over the next five years, the president will have to submit a proposal to Congress on how to repay taxpayers for financial sector losses.
On both sides, of course, there were those who expressed their reservations about the project.
“This is not what the American citizens have ordered us to do, that is, they are not protecting taxpayers’ dollars,” said California Republican Congressman Darrell Issa.
Her fellow Ohio Democrat, Mary Kaptur, said the measures were urgently needed by those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industrial prices continue to rise
In August 2008, domestic industrial sales prices increased by 0.1 percent compared to last month's prices and by 12.9 percent compared to August 2007 prices, the Central Bureau of Statistics (KSH) reported.
Industrial export prices rose by 1.1 percent compared to July 2008 and decreased by 3.9 percent compared to the previous year.
And as a result of changes in domestic and export prices, industrial production prices increased by 0.7 percent compared to the previous month and by 3.2 percent compared to the previous year.
Industrial sales prices increased only to a minimal extent, by 0.1 percent.
The domestic sales prices of the processing industry sectors increased minimally, by 0.1 percent compared to July.
The largest increase in the magnitude of prices occurred in August 2008, in the leather and footwear production sector (2.8 percent), primarily due to the 4.6 percent monthly increase in bags and belts and the 2.5 percent increase in footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical base materials resulted in a significant monthly increase in the prices of the chemical materials production branch (1.6 percent).
There was a decrease in price in the petrochemical sector, (1.4 percent), in the production of electric machines and instruments (0.9 percent), as well as - to a minimum - in the wood processing sectors (0.1 percent).
The prices of papermaking, publishing and printing did not change.
In the rest of the processing industry, there was a price increase between 0.2 and 0.9 percent.
In the supply of electricity, gas, heat and water, which represent a significant weight within domestic trade, there was an increase of 0.3 percent in August, primarily due to the effect of the increase in official prices from the first of July.
In a comparison of a twelve-month period - in domestic sales of the processing industry sectors - the largest price increase was recorded in the petrochemical sector (32.4 percent).
In the metalworking sector, an increase of 13.2 percent was observed, while in the food, beverage and tobacco industry, of decisive weight, there was an increase of 11 percent.
There was a decrease in prices in the textile industry (2.5 percent), as well as in the manufacture of electrical machines and instruments (0.3 percent).

Will you no longer need a visa to go to the United States next year?
Kinga G<0xC3><0xB6>ncz believes there are many possibilities for the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement to come into effect around January 12 - the foreign minister spoke about it in Chicago, before the Hungarians living there.
In his opinion, "practically everything depends on the timely construction of the electronic access and control system on the other side of the Atlantic."
At the same time he warned that in the new system will disappear the entry premise, but tourists before their departure from the country of origin must register.
As of today, the head of Hungarian diplomacy is holding talks in Washington.
He will meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice by handing her the Middle Cross with the Order of Merit Star of the Republic of Hungary and hold negotiations with international policy advisers of presidential candidates, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Both Barack Obama and McCain are in favor of the banks’ bailout package.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both candidates for the presidency of the two major U.S. parties, on Sunday assured their support for the administration's $700 million banking aid program, but there are politicians demanding the resignation of the finance minister.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after several days of marathon-type negotiations, announced in the early hours of Sunday: an agreement of principles on the financial rescue package of the banks was reached.
The financial package aimed at resolving the Wall Street crisis and defrosting the frozen credit market became the central theme of the presidential election campaign.
Both Obama and McCain want to show that they are more capable than their rival to get the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls, by putting economic issues first, Obama regained some advantage and the advantage McCain had gained after the Republican convention with Sarah Palin’s candidacy for vice president disappeared.
At a campaign rally in Detroit on Sunday, Obama expressed hope that Congress would quickly pass the $700 billion package bill.
He stressed that the proposal includes those consumer protection points, which he himself supported.
"We have to act now and responsibly ... employment, saving you, entire industries and the stability of the entire economy are in jeopardy," he told a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not miss the opportunity to call McCain’s economic concepts obsolete.
In an interview with ABC McCain, he explained that “we will all swallow this to the brim ... but not doing anything is simply not a viable path.”
The Republican senator said that the proposal includes the establishment of a commission to control the minister of fines and the limitation of executive compensation, he was the one who insisted on that.
Obama told CBS that McCain did not play any important role in the consultations, instead he consulted with the minister on a daily basis.
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that congressmen will likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Press magazine of the German-speaking area
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself the most conscious voters became – says Der Spiegel on the weak electoral result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider and his followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a rogue coalition.
The Mirror (spiegel.de)
In the electronic edition of the left-wing German magazine Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution devours its parents" he analyzes the reasons for the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU had begun long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo had taken over.
Social Christians for several decades were developing Bavaria – and now it is precisely these modern citizens who turn their backs on it.
The change of an era is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as of Angela Merkel.
The failure was not entirely surprising for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that had been foreseen for almost ten years: the undisputed hegemony of a state party disappeared.
Ten years ago, in 1998 the CSU gained 47.7 percent, for the first time below 50 percent since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago, in the 2005 Bundestag elections, that is, even during the so-called Stoiber era.
The reason for this is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they have made a lot of mistakes in the pace. However, the secularization, the results of education and the settlement of the North Germans in the developed regions of Bavaria had their negative consequences on the loyalty of the voters of the CSU.
With modernization the possibilities are also increased and this also has political consequences.
The right-wing group is intact, only that within the group itself the more conscious, more critical, and more stubborn voters became.
It is surprising that in the last few weeks it was precisely the conventional groups of citizens who strayed the most from the CSU; the self-employed, the small industrialists, those who have baccalaureate degrees and the graduates.
This resulted in less than 40 percent support for the CSU.
The Press (diepresse.com)
The conservative daily in Vienna: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "The presidents of the parties are very reserved on coalition issues" - it deals with the confusing situation of domestic politics after the Austrian elections.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The <0xC3><0x96>VP prohibits the SP<0xC3><0x96> from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZ<0xC3><0x96> is open in all directions to negotiate, but the Greens do not yet want to consult on the coalition.
Elections were already held, now everything revolves around the coalition; in the debate held on public television, party leaders barely showed anything of their decks.
Werner Faymann, the president of the SP<0xC3><0x96>, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the <0xC3><0x96>VP.
The SP<0xC3><0x96> wants to show that collaboration between the two parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social associations.
Fayman left open the question of whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the <0xC3><0x96>VP, in the position of Vice-Chancellor.
He claimed that in any case they disapproved of the Sch<0xC3><0xBC>ssel-Molterer era.
It is not possible to follow this political trend.
Molterer cautiously reacted to the red offers.
He said cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere in <0xC3><0x96>VP’s internal affairs.
It is still open in the party whether they will choose the opposition or join the coalition, these issues must be discussed without a doubt, within the <0xC3><0x96>VP itself.
The president of the BZ<0xC3><0x96>, J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, was open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are willing to take responsibility for the government,” Haider said.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit for Equal Opportunities has started today in Paris, with France hosting it, which is also the President of the European Union this year.
L<0xC3><0xAD>via J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka, Member of the European People's Party for Fidesz, in her message addressed to the plenary, as one of the main speakers of this professional meeting, called attention to segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations that hit Roma children and is also the biggest obstacle to the prevalence of their interest.
This high-level conference was opened - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner responsible for Jobs, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The meeting was attended by representatives of governments, European social partners and representatives of the most important European social rights organisations.
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka - according to the press office of the Fidesz group of deputies in the European Parliament - warned that in addition to employment discrimination, Gypsies are left out of the labor market in the first place because of their low level of education.
“Most young Gypsies have not finished middle school and because of the poor quality of basic education, only a negligible part can obtain a university diploma.”
J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a decisive role in the prevailing foundation of other human rights as well.
Investment in the education of Roma children at an early age can strengthen the economy of the Member States of the European Union.
According to the MEP, it is necessary to raise awareness of these issues widely among both Roma and non-Gypsies.
For the earlier a gypsy student starts school, the more chances he will have to become an active member of the labor market; through income and consumption taxes they will also contribute to the national budget.
"Gypsies, as citizens of the European Union, must be guaranteed the right to quality education and ensure the abolition of segregated and low-level education," said Livia J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
According to the MEP, the objective and active unity of the European Union is necessary to accelerate immediately the processes of school desegregation, for this it is of fundamental importance the correct compliance with the existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment, we must offer Roma children the possibility that guarantees the democratic space so that they can contribute to the future of Europe as full citizens" - demanded J<0xC3><0xA1>r<0xC3><0xB3>ka.
The aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities, which has been held annually since last year's Berlin meeting, as part of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities", is to ensure a unique forum to promote the abolition of discrimination and equal opportunities at European and national level in the Member States.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
A decision on the fate of the failed duo Huber-Beckstein will be made at the end of October
Despite the serious electoral defeat, no heads have yet been cut off at the summits of the Bavarian CSU, so far the debate on personal issues has been postponed.
Erwin Huber, president of the party and G<0xC3><0xBC>nther Beckstein, provincial prime minister still remain in their posts, but it is not known how long the grace will last.
The fate of the duo, who suffered a catastrophic electoral defeat of 17 percent, will be decided at the extraordinary congress of the party that will be held on the last weekend of October.
The members of the critically acclaimed duo let themselves be seen: they do not cling so much to their posts.
They sought to reassure the furious members of their parliamentary group and grassroots organisation, who a day after the “Bavarian tsunami” demanded personal consequences due to the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - although under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber who was at the top of his career - the Christian social union reached 60.7 percent, instead now, a year after the coup attested against Stoiber, they achieved only 43.4 percent.
The CSU for 46 years had “monopoly” in Bavaria that gives 18 percent of German GDP.
Although in the southern province, which is of key importance to the Hungarian economy, conservatives continue to dominate, in the future they will no doubt have to form a coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the party’s restructuring, Vice President Horst Seehofer, Federal Minister of Agriculture, one of Huber’s possible successors, also holds a position in the small intelligence group that starts negotiations with the liberal FDP and the right-wing Free Voters over a possible government coalition in Munich.
The strange thing about fate is that in the list of Free Voters enters the parliament that Gabriele Pauli, whose performance against Stoiber was taken advantage of for the coup of the duo Huber-Beckstein and then cruelly erased from the stage to the ambitious local politics.
The top CSU leaders are now investing all their energies to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transition will receive an active role Stoiber also that until now was moving the strings in the background, the former provincial head of government and former president of the CSU called September 28 as the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday Huber made some critical remarks to the CDU, in his opinion they would have deserved much more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and to Angela Merkel herself as well.
After the September 2009 Bundestag elections, Merkel will not be able to be chancellor if they are not able to highlight together the CSU that played a significant role in the successes of the 2005 national elections.
According to Merkel, who could hardly hide her disappointment at the failure, the losses of the CSU will not negatively affect the great Berlin coalition.
Which of course is relative: it will not be easier to treat the injured CSU and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent achieved its worst result since 1946 in Bavaria.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After Sunday’s elections, there will be no opposition MPs in the Belarusian parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained by the well-being and stability that Alexander Lukashenko guarantees in the country, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), this is rather explained by the violations of the law committed during the counting of the votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognise the election result.
Although the country's 10 million-strong legislature, composed of one hundred and ten deputies, had no opposition more than a decade ago, before yesterday's elections the united opposition under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODSZ) hoped that Lukashenko, who for the fourth time renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections, would "constitute" this amendment for dubious legitimacy.
Thus the ODSZ suppressed the boycott that it originally wanted to do.
At the bottom of the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, which increasingly depends on Russia economically - which took a credit to moderate the import of natural gas increasingly expensive from Russia and contributed to the sale to Russia of the Beltransgaz, owner of the pipeline that passes through the country - wanted to improve its relations with the European Union, which does not give it political to have a level of entry.
It was a sign of détente when the OSCE, in assessing the election campaign, placed emphasis on positive phenomena rather than errors – such as a ban on taxing one-third of opposition candidates.
However, Monday's OSCE primary report criticized even the campaign itself - in which opposition candidates could not appear in the press - and especially that the opposition could not be present in the counting of votes.
With all this in the opinion of the opposition there is an improvement in the political climate: political prisoners were released and Minsk is ready for a small confrontation with Moscow, denying the recognition of the separation of South Ossetia and Abkhazia from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus theoretically constitutes a federal state - already a month ago considers the two regions as independent.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the European Union has started," Milinkevich told the newspaper.
According to the opposition candidate of the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable to maintain this situation, despite the fact that "the regime fears to allow the entry of even one opponent into that weightless parliament".
The opposition does not plan to organize protests on seeing the results, rather it tries to get its message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
- This clearly causes us many problems because we must print the opposition press in Russia, local authorities put difficulties in their distribution, but even so I see that more and more are supporting the change among the elderly as well - said Milinkevich, alluding to the fact that the Lukashenko regime, which believes that their main result is the creation of social security, if they do not consider it to be the most appropriate.
Due to the country’s indebtedness and increased trade deficit, it is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security that “looks like the silence of cemeteries” – Milinkevich opined.
Russian observers, unlike the opposition politician, called the election democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, head of the Commonwealth of Independent States mission, told the Russian news agency Ria Novosti: "People do not believe in words but in facts", so the lack of opposition is nothing more than a testimony to the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on you have breakfast before you start working"
It has never happened in the history of Chigi Palace that they set automatic doors to control the entry and exit of staff.
but from today it starts with this measure against who signs up and then goes to the bar to have a coffee at work.
This news was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and by the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The automatic doors - says Brunetta - are an instrument to work better, with greater productivity, more presence and more services," the minister said.
“A new season of accountability and transparency is now opening.
This is Reformism,” Brunetta stresses again.
With Palacio Chigi, the installation is completed in all the buildings of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi "the choice of automatic doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
No resistance has been found on the part of the employees, says the Secretary General: "it has been a change shared by the workers and there was collaboration on part of them."
In short, no more breakfast during working hours; no more coffee and half-moons.
Brunetta's word, which suggests, smiling, "a good cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand."
During a convention at the Higher School of Public Administration
“In three months the absences due to diseases of public employees have been reduced by 50%, which means 60,000 more people to work in a year.”
And he adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more effective
“In the last 8-10 years, wage dynamics have been double that of the private sector and well above the inflation rate.”
For now, millions of public employees have joined to oppose the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the Codacons-backed petition.
“As the Minister of Public Function shows the numbers, the lowest absenteeism from work due to disease causes – writes the Consumers Association – the people of the ‘vague workers’ are constantly increasing.
There are indeed millions in Italy of correct and productive civil servants who have joined together to declare war on the illegitimate norms of the decree.
In particular, the Tar will answer the exclusion of economic treatments added due to illness due to service; the extension of the time zones in which the sick employee's medical check-ups are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Accidents at work, Napolitano: "Crucial prevention"
Every day in Italy, 2,500 accidents occur at work, 3 people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail data effectively confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1,200.
Figures testifying to the severity of a phenomenon that is one of the leading causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To draw the attention of the institutions, social forces and the media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the 58th national day for the victims of work accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data disseminated by the Anmil and the same tragic news these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the president of the Anmil, the National Association mutilated and disabled by work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his "great appreciation for the constant associative commitment to the prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance to the families of victims and the awareness of public opinion".
"It has manifested itself, a 'enough', sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, due to their dimensions, provoke the clamor of the media and the participation of public opinion, but everyday reality proposes dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamics."
Napolitano does not hide that "there is undoubtedly a resource problem: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
The numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness of young people entering the world of work take on particular significance.
It is a duty to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to restrain the alarm about social gravity, to apply and improve legislative rules.
For his part, the Speaker of the House Gianfranco Fini has stressed "how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a determined effort to urgently put an end".
“Data on accidents at work seem to indicate a slight positive trend, but this does not take away that the number of white deaths is equally impressive,” said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
“We don’t really want this ‘trend to decline’ to translate into less attention, because it’s precisely when attention diminishes that tragedy explodes.
"We believe that at a general level too little is still done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the remedy can be exercised through multiple actions.
They are necessary, in our view - has highlighted Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school ".
"A further effort is needed - he added - as far as communication and public awareness are concerned.
But above all, it serves a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers regarding a phenomenon that represents a social emergency.”
Mercandelli has denounced "the progressive deterioration of the level of subsidiary protection envisaged for victims of labour" and the "assistive diversion to which the system is heading in recent years".
"The goal is to return the worker the insurance guarantee - he has added - because the luck of the accidenter does not have to depend on the gift arranged by the legislator each time."
MP3 Players Under Charge Put Hearing at Risk
Listening to high-volume music over a long period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing injuries.
In a statement released in Brussels, the European Commission cited the opinion of the EU Scientific Commission on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (CSRSERI), published today.
"From this scientific opinion - it is read in the note - it appears that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable musical devices weekly for more than an hour a day having the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing."
“I am concerned that such a high number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and high-acoustic cell phones can unconsciously ruin their ears in an irreparable way,” says Meglena Kuneva.
“From the scientific evidence – the EU’s responsibility continues – a clear risk emerges and we must react quickly.
What matters is raising awareness among consumers and making this information public.
We must also re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific opinion so that they are widely effective and keep up with the new technology.”
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, seeing the large use of portable musical instruments and the increase in the number of young people exposed to the noise that that originates.
"Scientists confirm that this is a cause for concern and the European Commission will now, together with Member States and stakeholders, examine what measures could eventually be taken to better protect children and adolescents from noise exposure from portable musical instruments and related devices."
Currently, there is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music devices to 100 dB, but concern is growing as hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such sources of noise.
It is possible to greatly limit these damages by resorting to solutions such as the reduction of levels and the time of exposure to noise.
In its view, the EU Scientific Committee points out that users of portable music devices listen to high volume (more than 89 decibels) music for only 5 hours a week exceed the current limit on the maximum noise allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a period of 5 years.
It means that it affects 5-10% of users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, German paves the way for the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it begins, in March it closes, in June the accounts will be made.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and for the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Commission members will discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, the board and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects, in order to present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official bubble" of the Municipality and its intendant Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas - it tends to underline German - It will have to provide proposals for the development of Rome in which those who decide politically, the board and the municipal council, will then be able to endorse.
There is no superfluous position of roles, only the will to have a place where to draw up a great project for Rome.
By the end of March the work will disappear, because this experience must have a precise time limit.
In June, we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of the capital of Rome.
To whom the Commission accuses it of being useless, since its opinions are not binding, Alemano replies: "It all depends on the work that will be able to be done by the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If quality is present, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am also sure in Rome, its contribution will be fundamental.
Almost always the policy is crushed in ordinary management and in emergencies that back and forth manifest themselves.
We, on the contrary, want to look further and longer term, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
The mayor of Rome also tends to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a triviality: it is absolutely free, does not cost a euro to Roman citizens and will serve to involve and reason the best minds that the capital expresses".
For German, indeed, "it is necessary to have a strategic design as a reference, not closed or stationary, to allow our city to make an authentic level jump, of which we have an absolute need, thinking in a unitary spirit to its future."
A future that, the mayor of Rome says, "would not be limited only to the current communal boundaries but would look beyond" not only from the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as Capital but "also considering the role that Rome can and must develop as Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president.
He wrote an American political note that interests him as an independent: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions reduced the U.S. economy and piped relations (as he also does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
Attacks on Obama are on the rise as the election date approaches.
a Miami lady wrote on a Web site: "This person is full of ambition.
“Obama has a big stone face: he believes he will win the highest office in the nation that has had two governors and five black senators!”
In reality, they are attacks that don’t say much; they are attacks that are clearly racial in nature and don’t answer the question of voters: will he be a good president? And there are also polls; everyone says Obama won and with a good advantage.
Also in this case there are those who speak with the heart but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper, in the bowels of the southern United States, has written an editorial: once in the voting booth we will know well who the American patriot will vote for.
Out comes one side of the American mentality covered to the last.
“Say what you want, we’ll think about where to put the cross, whether it’s about Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear: if Obama wins, we will leave America.
things never said before now, which seems almost certain the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these reasonings, the winning weapon for the Democrats is George Bush.
They have asked 1500 people: what have been the mistakes made by Bush during his term? 89 percent have answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home kicks in the ass.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who have lost their lives and the Americans have not been forced to pack their bags.
Iraq, for the most part, has also been Bush’s weak point.
Whoever takes over as George W. Bush will have a huge duty to develop.
In the US, the economic collapse is also felt by journalists: in the newspapers it is time for cuts. Many blame the Internet, the "murder" of printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists have been asked by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control for the future.
Today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, journalists have not openly stated they are less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel isolated as they once did.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the room where the editors work to make the newspaper, is a big problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if traditional journalism as understood by the majority of the public is not to be reduced substantially.
A clear but complex pessimism prevails today over the American journalist.
Six out of ten journalists and executives are convinced that journalism at the national level is following the wrong path.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against emission.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web is going.
The largest publishing houses open a gap in the Internet, for many seen as the “killer” of the printed letter.
The “economic pressure” that journalists warn has increased by up to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed have admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope of “doing something good” for journalism.
The biggest break today in American journalism is between who runs the newspapers – that is, the directors – and the journalists who work for them.
56% of executives nationwide are sure that their journalists share the same values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “work safety.”
Executives who plan to lose their jobs in 3 years are 47% nationally.
For the journalistic staff it is 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In an immense nation like the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and the Internet, employers often offer what they want and thus become a matter of “take it or leave it”.
Directors almost always get good salaries, while writers can earn up to $10,000 a month, plus retirement and social security.
For the holidays, the reasoning becomes complicated: a total of days the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by his admission, get "sick" followed throughout the year.
It is all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL OF ROME, DANILO COPPOLA STAYS IN GROTTAFERRATA
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the instance of the real estate agent Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his city, Grottaferrata, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in the context of the investigation into the contra pact relating to the Unipol-Bnl escalation.
In the course of the arrest process in his charge, last week, he has obtained home release, transforming it into a mandatory residence to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked for the real estate to be able to travel the route from the city of the province to a room in the capital.
According to the court, these trips (for which the PM has voted against) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
The Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the vote of the House of Representatives against the $700 million bailout plan put in place by the White House: a significant portion of Americans were, and this, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times confirmed yesterday that the ongoing crisis is disarming the Republican party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, supportive of federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "those of Washington" and the world of finance, strong in the South and especially in the South.
The soul, in fact, has become prepotent with the vote of the one who spoke at the beginning.
This is just one example of the mutations, of the great mutations, that the ongoing economic earthquake announces: not only in the United States but in the entire West and not only here.
Both in the United States and in Europe for a long time the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubation phenomena that with the new climate solidify and come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary reactivation, of the dual state-sovereignty category in relation to a type of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking institutions – financial institutions that have, yes, strong financial relations with the outside world, but above all, the balance sheets of families living in a single country and in a single state are much more compromised.
The one that immediately creates a political problem for those who govern it: that is, how to respond to the difficulty and protests of those people and those families who, on the other hand, are voters.
The crisis appears economically worldwide but is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially out of the question or has little to say: the crucial test is the European Union which, as always, is divided between different interests and different state strategies, fails to decide any common policy.
It is from the government of each state that everyone expects an intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and above all the grant of funds: from the moment you arrive at the court is only the state that has the economic resources and the mass of financial resources to remedy things.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances in which no market and no organization can probably ever dispose of to the same extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the nation-state is in perfect harmony, with the greatest importance provided that the new development of the economy tends to attribute it to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had entered the network of increasingly sophisticated technology, of the immaterial, while we were convinced that global finance was already destined to dominate the world, we realized that our future will instead have to do more and more with the immaterial things like water, crops and oil.
All things, you see, can certainly be transported from one place to another of the earth but are equally united in an absolute way in a circumscribed space, a territory.
So whoever finds himself sovereign certainly has many more letters than he who is not, and who has the misfortune of living in a post without crops, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty that but foreshadows a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics and Leadership.
In this sense, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand the objective awareness of the need for leadership, the request of someone who knows how to take the situation in hand.
On the other hand a wave of discredit for the existing leaderships, of an economic nature relieved inadequate with many dark areas.
And together something deeper and in a certain unsettling sense: a discredit, an intolerance, an inadequate image, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class of the Western countries in increasing numbers.
It seems to advance more and more, in various places of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same as those of the hitherto booming social elites, the same way of feeling and being, their culture in the comprehensive exception of the term, to have made the time itself and to be stranger to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, in short, subterraneanly feeds a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and of the traditional political structures, which manifest themselves in an electoral "revolt" or in the sudden changes of collective moods of recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavaria to the re-collapse of the Great Consensus.
There is the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their format would say some, always make it more difficult to understand and then to represent, what from today that is taking shape are the deep strata of Western society and that the economic crisis renews, increases and potentially agitates.
In the face of all this, to speak of a “mass rebellion” today is frankly exaggerated.
But having your eyes open certainly isn’t.
The super glue to walk on the walls
Overcome the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future walk on the walls as the spider man.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has come pretty close.
With an adhesive of only 2.5 square centimeters, scientists have been able to stick a 100-kilo body on a vertical wall.
The American journal Science has published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of researchers is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular carbon structure, called carbon nanotubes.
“The glue principle can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
Scientists have been inspired by the legs of geckos, coated with microscopic hairs that can ensure the animal a perfect adhesion.
Tests done on different materials, such as glass, teflon and sandpaper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the legs of this reptile and at the same time “easily peels off the walls,” explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
"This material could be useful as a transient adhesive," adds Liming Dai.
Layers to walk through the walls exactly like Spider-Man? Layers yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications may have to do with aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
The University of Berkeley, California, is also devoting itself to the search for a new adhesive.
In an article in the American Chemical Society, Californian scholars have presented an adhesive made of microfibers like hair that self-cleans itself from the dust during movement on a surface to always maintain perfect adhesion.
Drugs: never with fruit juice
Pay attention to grapefruit juice, orange juice and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in summer because they are refreshing and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some drugs, their absorption is altered by amplifying or decreasing, as the case may be, the efficiency with serious consequences for health.
To repeat the risk of fruit juices are packaged freshly associated with the intake of some medicines David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who since the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in progress to Philadelphia sends a new alarm: just a glass of grapefruit juice, orange and apple juice to reduce the health effects of some beetroot, orange and apple.
Grapefruit juice had already been under indictment because it was held responsible for increasing to toxic levels some anti-arrhythmic, antibiotic, anxiolytic, antihistamine and neurological drugs.
The same Italian drug agency had given the news in a newsletter two years ago alarming doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger that resulted from this mixture and to pay attention to what is drunk in the case of taking a drug such as Diasepam or Methadone.
Not just the grapefruit – According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
A long list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan, said: “These discoveries in general are pointed out to the various international and national drug agencies that eventually provide to change the information notes of the same.
Therefore, it is always necessary to read the illustrative leaflets of the medicines that are taken and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not let us impress, ask clearly the doctor or pharmacist,” stressed the expert of the agency Ansa.
The Economics Novel by Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics has been awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies, his models of trade and on the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Keynesian Neo who teaches at Princeton University and is a noted New York Times columnist.
Krugman is one of the biggest critics of the Bush administration’s decisions regarding the economy and foreign policy.
A few months after the September 11, 2001, attack on Enron, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequence for the United States.
A prediction that triggers much controversy and that for several years came reproached to the economy, but that has now been revealed exactly.
“I’m surprised and a little upset by how the memory of the Enron and Worldcom collapse scandal has quickly disappeared from the public eye,” Krugman said in a statement.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi of the European Central Bank’s executive committee, Krugman is a “high-value economist,” but also a whistleblower with a “very aggressive, particularly critical, style against the excesses of liberalism in the Bush administration.”
Open Office, echo the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package
It is the launch day of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to attract more and more users, from home to the office to public administration professionals, as a free alternative to the well-known Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by the volunteer developers, whose backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several new features: to the welcome screen and the less coarse magazine interface, more consistent ones are added, such as compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new format ODF(Optima) 1.
Also paying attention to the multifunction with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of the PowerPoint presentation, useful for example, to send it via e-mail, or the possibility of importing the PDF file in the graphic drafting module, preserving the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "Hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the Adobe format with the elements of a spreadsheet or a word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received different improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet can intervene in various users, avoiding conflicts of modifications, in the elaboration of texts, each collaborator is given a color in the comment for better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version can be downloaded at http://en.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English version that was in the mirror since Friday.
As well as for Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent home or to work.
And if the theme of the free can be a hook for dissemination in homes, it is in the business sphere that Open Office suite tests, tries the big bet, and can already count on several projects carried out in the public administration and in schools.
And not even the realities that offer an ideal training, consultation and assistance service for small and medium-sized companies, in which business prospects could be opened.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for video writing the corresponding Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that replaces Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint presentation; Dbase, eat in the case of the well-known Access is the program that allows you to work on the data base; and finally Draw the graphical module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that to date we have reached almost 3 million 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that the expected figure can be exceeded.
Kohl also tested positive for the fourth doping case
New positive case on the French tour: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third ranked and winner of the best rower of the climber.
To give the news is the site of the newspaper L'Equipe.
Kohl, 26, is the fourth positive EPO runner of the third generation, after the Italians Riccardo Ricc<0xC3><0xB2> and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from the Gerolsteiner.
Analysis of Kohl’s blood champions is among those carried out in recent weeks in the Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-tests confirm that it is positive, the Austrian will lose the third place in the Tour and will be angry at the two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl’s positive doping to the third generation EPO is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who has told the Associated Press that he has notified the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian has positioned himself on the podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, being awarded the rowing of the best climber.
IMMIGRANTS:NEW YORK TIMES wonders, IS ITALY A Racist?
Italy as an emigrant country has only recently become a privileged destination for the “hostilely welcomed” immigrants.
This is what the New York Times asks in a long article that has devoted to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed the previous month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case demonstrates what the New York Times defines as the “Northern Paradox”: the northern regions are at the same time those where there is “more integration and more work” but also the highest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the highest support of the Northern League.
As confirmed by the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, the New York Times has also cited episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not only that.
Also the new legislation wanted by the League tightens the brake on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
According to the Pope, “Giorgio Napolitano, meeting Benedict XVI in Congress, has called for the state and the church to work together to combat racism.”
Students victims of expensive rent, up to 900 euros per room
The rental market for college students is not aware of the crisis.
According to the latest Sunia survey, the tenants’ union, renting a single room could cost a student 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"the phenomenon has already assumed very serious characteristics to the point of excluding the right to study a large proportion of young people for the very high costs that the family would have to bear - explains the head of the Sunia studies office, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand has totally distorted the market to the point of triggering a process of widespread increase even for residents."
Except that in most cases the rental offers contain a number of violations: free type contracts, unregistered, no canon limit, sub linked rentals.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are necessary that, through the revision of the tax, prices can be regulated.
Looking in detail at the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in Brianza area, they serve approximately 450 euros; for a single room from a minimum of 650 (Bande Nere area) to an average value of 800 (Lambiate area, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a bed costs an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the areas near the University, they serve 250/280 euros for a bed in a double room and 370 to 500 euros for an individual.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) you are asked about 600 euros for a single room and 450 for a bed in a double room.
Only slightly lower values (550 euros for a single room) in areas near other Universities (Ostiense and Cinecitt<0xC3><0xA0>).
It becomes economy only if you change peripheral area: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a single room in zone Prenestina, Centocelle and surroundings.
In Naples for a bed you serve 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bed you serve 250/350 euros, at least 350 for an individual.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but it has a greater weight in the city’s economy.
In cities such as Perugia, where the phenomenon of student and extra-community rents is more frequent, there is a further anomaly: a 25/30% increase in the canon for foreign students compared to Italians.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso, the cities cancel the historic rooms
Historical movie theaters close favoring the Multiplexes.
“A city without cinemas in a blind city is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the big Italian urban centers and also in the provincial cities.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, which with the birth of the great meticons on the periphery and the consequent disappearance of the mono rooms in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and indisputable event with all the characteristics of a true cultural crime.
To disappear are almost always historical places, full of memory, "it is as if a friend died, an acquaintance with whom a piece of place was shared and so much emotion", observes the director of the new cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won the cousin Oscar and the grand prize of the jury in Cannes, which told the poetry of a cinema in a way lost and the nostalgia for cinema that time to live.
The figures given by Anec, the main association of merchants, are clear: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas have closed, and most of the rooms in the main cities are to be paid for: 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 less in Turin and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures are first, Emilia-Romagna with 82 fewer cinemas, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
It is a demonstration that the responsible for his disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these three Italian regions that have registered the largest number of new meticone cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 in Tuscany than in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian exercise has developed irrationally,” observes Paolo Protti, president of the Anec, “it would be useful to build new structures but it would be necessary to guarantee the permanence of those already existing, because when a city hall closes, not all its frequenters are willing to transfer to the meticons.
Not to mention the lack of funds in favor of traders: the previous debt of the state is approximately 10 million euros.
It is shameful from an ethical and moral point of view that the government does not respect the laws that exist.
To sustain the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year.”
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city concerned about the closures, decided to repair itself with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to promote and protect the cinema mono sala either in the historic center or on the periphery.
Among the planned rules there are fiscal facilitation measures in favor of managers and advantages for the public in terms of mobility: spectators will be able to enter the restricted traffic area and will have special rates for parking.
“It’s an initiative that I like,” observes Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope that other cities will follow Bologna’s example by putting other measures in place.
It is true, that to contrast the extra power of meticons, traditional rooms have to improve the quality of sound and image because the public today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a topic that for me was always important: the closure of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to make the "New Cinema Paradise", which I had already thought of for 10 years.
I have been living in Rome for 25 years, and when I pass the Rialto or the Quirinale of Via Nazionale already closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, so as not to see the posters blackened by the dust, I turn to the other side.
Link between politics and 'ndrangheta, has been arrested the mayor of Gioia Tauro
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was available to standardize the elections of the Municipality for those interested in the Piromalli cosca."
The charges that the magistrates of the Anti-Mafia Directorate of Calabria give to the intendant and the deputy intendant of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the intendant of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafia association, are heavy.
Also arrested was Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson lawyer, the boss's namesake, already convicted of mafia criminal association and to indemnify 10 million euros.
"Disrespecting any legal and moral norms, and of good sense," the prosecutors write, the two local administrations had expressed a willingness to pay for consultations to lawyer Piromalli.
“The mafia family would have been allowed to officially enter the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of control and command of the public administration.”
The president of the Calabrian regional board Agazio Loiero does not hide that "agreements between bad organized life there is a lot" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the ‘ndrangheta, heroes who stay clean.’
This morning’s arrests add up to those of last July after police announced the head cut of the Piromalli mafia family.
Since the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro had been dissolved, already in 1991 and always due to alleged conditions between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been relieved of the task of managing the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, intendant, of the Udc at the time of the dissolution, after the ballot in May 2006, had been elected as head of a center-right coalition.
I explode a scandal when the Prefecture orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call in the case of the Deputy Minister of the Interior who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having organized everything on a political issue, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that Piromalli had even come to ask for the variation of the A3 road project.
From the environmental interceptions made to Dal Torrione, the judges write, emerges "the willingness to favor the demands of an entrepreneur, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration over the interests of mafia families".
When the energy is born from the waves, the great ones come down to the stage.
It is an exterminated deposit that occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface and is being discovered now by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources that greats like Chevron look at.
The possibility of gathering energy from the movements of the sea has been studied for a hundred years and in the 70s along with the first oil crisis, investigations intensified.
When the price of oil was low, in 1980, the idea of harnessing marine energy was put aside, but now that environmental cases and the new oil increase give impetus to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London has estimated for 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity needs could be covered by implants that exploit the movement of sea waves.
This would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
And there would also be currents and tides.
Giants on the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build an implant in Northern Portugal.
When the intention was announced it seemed a revolutionary step.
Two years away from betting on marine energy are always more and among these companies who have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technology,” a spokesman for a company associated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question is about obtaining permission from the U.S. Energy Commission to carry out a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It’s a pretty important sign, considering that in Alaska the U.S. continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has activated a plan to make new drilling.
In addition to Chevron is Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the path of energy coming from the sea, the total invested so far, although not detailed indicate an increasing interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts talk about a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now, impacts such as those of the Portuguese or Scots are small and do not seem to create major problems for the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, a technology with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the options are several: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of wells joined together.
The force of the waves, which causes the buoys to move up and down becomes hydraulic pressure with pistons and cylinders inside them.
The pressure rotates a turbine which in turn feeds a generator.
Electricity is sent to the coast via submarine cables.
For now there are four such implants in development, waiting only for federal approval, apart from energy, could serve for a military facility.
Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping mall and parking lot, using underwater turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of the water when there are tides, turns the blades of the turbines, creating a rotating movement that feeds the generator.
Verdant has said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary authorizations to use the energy.
After the waves, the tides.
A particular interest, they say at the Institute for the Development of Electric Power, deserves at this time the potential of the tides.
While it is an intermittent phenomenon, tides are more preventable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is above all about the tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others that are approaching the coast, have invested 7 and a half million dollars in 2008 and an investment of 35 million is planned for 2009.
