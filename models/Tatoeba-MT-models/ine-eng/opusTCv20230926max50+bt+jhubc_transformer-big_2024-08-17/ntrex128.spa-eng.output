Members of the Assembly (AM) of Wales are concerned about "looking like muppets"
Some Members of the Assembly are puzzled by the suggestion that their title should be changed to Members of the Parliament of Wales (MWP).
This confusion arises from plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that this may be ridiculed.
A member of the Labour Party Assembly said his group was concerned "that he would stay with Twp and Pwp".
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means fool and pwp means poop.
A member of the Welsh Party Assembly said his entire group was "dissatisfied" and has suggested alternatives.
A member of the Conservative Party of Wales said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that the MWP's pronunciation jump to muppet was small.
In this context, the pronunciation of the letter w in Welsh is similar to that of the letter u in English of Yorkshire.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently drafting legislation to introduce the name change, states: "Of course, the final decision on any descriptive element of the name of the Members of the Assembly will be a matter for the Members themselves."
The 2017 Welsh Government Act gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals which revealed broad support for calling the Parliament of Wales to the Assembly.
On the question of the title of Members of the Assembly, the Commission preferred Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP), but the MWP option gained most of the support in a public consultation.
Members of the Assembly appear to be suggesting alternative options, but the struggle to reach a consensus could bring the head of the Speaker of the Assembly, Elin Jones, who should submit the bill on the changes in a few weeks.
Reform legislation will include other changes related to the functioning of the Assembly, such as rules on disqualification of Members of the Assembly and the design of the committee system.
Members of the Assembly will have the final say in the question of what they should be called when deliberating on legislation.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on a referendum on the name change of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether their country's name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was called in an attempt to resolve a decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has always insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly opposed its candidacy for membership of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the plebiscite on the name change, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay to join the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin remain silent because of the difficulties of the churches of Harlem
“Historically, the seniors I’ve talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Adams said.
“Today, there is neither one thing nor the other.”
He noted that the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“Now people socialize in a different way,” he says.
“Bars are no longer the living rooms of neighborhoods that neighbors regularly go to.”
With regard to churches, he worries that the money obtained from the sale of goods will not last as long as leaders expect and that “sooner or later, they will return to the starting point.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment buildings filled with the kind of people who won’t help the sanctuaries left in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white people," he said, "and therefore will accelerate the closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will end up being members of these churches."
The two churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis: the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin a decade later.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 30s of the 20th century.
A black congregation that was worshipping nearby acquired the building.
A black congregation took the reins of St. Martin, under the direction of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of 125th Street merchants, a Harlem shopping street, who resisted hiring or promoting black people.
In 1939, a fire left the building severely damaged and, while Father Johnson’s parishioners were making plans for its reconstruction, they also commissioned the carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, son and successor of Father Johnson in St. Martin, proudly called it “the campaigns of the poor.”
In July, the expert who played the carillon called it “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
In addition, the expert, Tiffany Ng, of the University of Michigan, noted that it was the world's first carillon used by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who went to play the larger Riverside Church carillon, 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather commented that St. Martin did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin in recent months has been a complicated history of architects and contractors, some brought in by lay church leaders and others by the Episcopal Diocese.
The parish board, the governing body of the parish, made up of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July commenting on its concern that the diocese "attempts to pass the costs" to the board, although it had not participated in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Wounds 13-Year-Old Boy Diving for Locusts in California
A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California the day the lobster season opened, officials said.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told San Diego-based KSWB-TV that he had been diving with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the child asking for help, so he approached a group to get him out of the water.
Hammel commented that, at first, he thought he was just excited about catching a lobster, but then realized that "he was screaming that he had been bitten.
,
He had a broken collarbone," Hammel observed as he reached the boy's side.
“I yelled at everyone to come out of the water because there was a shark,” Hammel said.
The boy was transported by helicopter to Rady Children Hospital, where he is in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
The rescuer, Captain Larry Giles, said at a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but that it had not been considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim showed traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed access to the beach, from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Encinitas, for 48 hours to investigate and for security reasons.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans boost UK beauty market
Sainsbury's acquires Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, which have many employees specializing in the hallways of their style and beauty establishments.
In order to significantly boost the UK beauty market, valued at <0xC2><0xA3>2800 trillion and with growth going up compared to the fall in fashion and household goods sales, the largest beauty aisles will be put to the test in 11 stores across the country and, if they pass it successfully, the same will be done in more stores next year.
The investment in beauty comes at the same time as this supermarket chain is looking for ways to use the space on shelves that used to be intended for TVs, microwaves and household appliances.
Sainsbury’s said it would double its beauty offering with up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
In addition, the existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be given more space, with areas similar to those of other establishments, such as Boots.
The chain will also relaunch its Boutique makeup range with a majority of animal-friendly products, something increasingly demanded by younger customers.
The Fragrance Shop will also test its concessions at two Sainsbury’s establishments, the first recently opened in Croydon, South London, last week, and the second at Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online stores and the shift towards daily shopping for small amounts of food at local stores force supermarkets to strive to convince people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, the chief executive of Sainsbury’s, has said the stores will increasingly resemble shopping malls as the supermarket chain tries to fight discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more non-food services and products.
Sainsbury's has integrated Argos discount points into hundreds of stores and has introduced several Habitats since its purchase of these chains two years ago. This is considered to have boosted grocery sales and further monetized these acquisitions.
The previous attempt by the supermarket chain to renovate its beauty and pharmacy departments was a failure.
Sainsbury's put a joint operation with Boots to the test in the early 2000s, but the collaboration ended after a discussion on how to split the revenue from drugstores in their supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after the sale of the 281 pharmaceutical establishments from Sainsbury’s to Celesio, a company owned by the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
It is noted that Lloyds will participate in the plan, adding an expanded range of luxury skincare brands, such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer, Sainsbury’s, said: “We have transformed the look and feel of our beauty aisles to enhance the environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in a specialized staff who will be available to offer advice.
Our brand offering is designed to fit every need, while an attractive environment and comfortable location make us an irresistible destination for beauty products, challenging the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'furious' after Holly Willoughby breaks <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal
Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, went "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby broke an 11 million pound deal with her lifestyle business line to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time to devote to fashion brand and accessories Truly.
This business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced that she was leaving the business on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has infuriated Dragon’s Den star Peter Jones by abandoning his lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on his extraordinary new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to the sources consulted, Jones was "angry" when the TV gold girl admitted that her new deals, valued at up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million, did not leave time to devote to Truly, her fashion brand and accessories, during a tense meeting held Tuesday at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire.
The business had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was shaping up as a favourite to double Willoughby’s fortune of about <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, announced that he was leaving the business on Instagram, Jones was leaving Britain to go to one of his vacation homes.
As one source commented, “Truly was, by far, Holly’s top priority.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would keep her for the next two decades.
His decision to leave left everyone involved totally stunned.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so close to the launch.
There’s a warehouse full of merchandise at Marlow headquarters, products ready to go on sale.”
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of Britain’s most profitable stars, could cost the company millions due to the significant investment in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothes, and possibly further delay its launch.
It could also mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, are parents to three children and have a close relationship with Jones and his wife, Tara Capp.
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couples went on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin’s television production company.
Willoughby will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said that last night "no business issues were talked about."
A difficult conversation "and then we fell in love"
He joked about the criticism he receives from the media for making a comment that some would consider "unpresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so many things?
Trump commented in his mocking voice as a “news presenter.”
“I have not given up on anything.”
He said Kim is interested in meeting with him again after Trump hailed the first meeting held in June in Singapore, which he considered a major step toward North Korea’s denuclearization.
However, negotiations for denuclearization have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, explained to world leaders gathered at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that his country does not see an “adequate” U.S. response to the first steps for North Korea’s disarmament.
On the contrary, he noted, the U.S. continues to apply sanctions in order to maintain pressure.
Trump’s perspective was much more optimistic in the speech he gave during his rally.
“We’re doing great with North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have a fantastic relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile tests, help to free hostages and bring the remains of U.S. soldiers back home.
In addition, he defended his unusual approach when talking about relations with Kim.
“It’s very easy to be presidential, but so, instead of 10,000 people out there trying to get into this crowded stadium, we’d have about 200 people right here,” Trump said, pointing to the people standing right in front of him.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate an island, leaving hundreds dead
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were informed that their help was not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of the Lombok population had had to move, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for catalyzing international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they do not request international assistance, which complicates things a little bit,” Ms. Sumbung explains.
Although Save the Children is preparing a team to send to Palu, they are still not sure if foreign staff can work on the ground.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national emergency agency, explained that authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations were allowed to provide assistance.
Given that the land is constantly moving in Indonesia, the country remains incredibly unprepared when nature unleashes its wrath.
Although tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, not many are seen in other coastal areas.
The apparent lack of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, even though there was a previous warning, is likely to have contributed to the loss of life.
At best, traveling from one island of Indonesia to another is a challenge.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to serve the victims of the earthquake is heading to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s worn-out infrastructure the central axis of his election campaign, and has spent quite a bit of money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of funding has affected Mr. Joko's administration, which is facing a re-election next year.
In addition, it must cope with the pressure of persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people died and tens of thousands had to leave their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets using machetes, bows and arrows, and other rudimentary weapons.
Watch this: Daniel Sturridge, from Liverpool, equals the score against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League loss to Chelsea with a goal in the 89th minute on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri just over 27 metres from Chelsea's goal when the score was 1-0.
He placed the ball in his left foot with a touch before throwing it to the second stick.
The action sent him over the area and headed to the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball passed over Kepa Arrizabalaga who tried to stop him with a jump and fell into the net.
"I was trying to put myself in that position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play very far ahead, so I tried to give myself as much time as possible," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante approaching and I gave him a touch. I didn't think about it too much, I just fired the shot."
Chelsea were going to win 1-0 in the first half after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues midfielder made a heel pass to Mateo Kovacic in that play, before turning making a regatta near the midfield and entering the Liverpool field.
Kovacic quickly passed the ball and ran out in the middle of the field.
Then he made a nice pass to the space that led Hazard to the area.
Hazard stood in front of the defense and finished by throwing the ball into the net of the second post with a kick with the left foot that Alisson Becker of Liverpool could not stop.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League. The match will be held at St. Paul's Stadium, in Naples (Italy).
Chelsea face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
Indonesia's Tsunami Death toll rises to 832
The number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832, as reported by the country's emergency agency early on Sunday.
Many people were trapped among the rubble of buildings that collapsed during the magnitude 7.5 earthquake that occurred on Friday and triggered waves up to six meters, the agency’s spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said during a press conference.
The city of Palu, with more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered with remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man as murder suspect after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been opened after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
The 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, on John Street, which led to the arrest of a 32-year-old man as a murder suspect.
The police have urged people in the area who have seen or heard something to turn to the police.
Inspector Brian O'Hagan commented: "The investigation is in the early stages, but I would encourage anyone who was near John Street in Birkenhead to see or hear anything suspicious that they had contacted us.
In addition, I would recommend anyone, especially taxi drivers, who has been able to pick up something on dashcam to contact us as they may have vital information for our investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and that she was inside a property.
This afternoon some people who think they know the woman arrived at the crime scene to find out where they had found her this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and police have reported that they are in the process of informing the victim’s relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to re-enter his apartment, but police tell him that no one can enter or leave the building.
He was puzzled when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now informed that they will be allowed to re-enter within a few hours.
Someone heard an agent tell a man that the whole area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared on the spot in tears.
He keeps saying, "It's terrible."
At two in the afternoon, there were two police vans inside the cordon and one more outside.
Several agents remained standing inside the cordon controlling the floor block.
Anyone with information is asked to send an email to DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, September 30 registration 247.
Cromwell's Parliament statue becomes the latest commemorative success for "rewriting history"
His ban would be an act of poetic justice for this Taliban-style destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious objects carried out by his fanatical Puritan followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's suggestions as a "crazy" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, commented: “In the current debate about the removal of statues, it was inevitable that removing Oliver Cromwell’s figure from the Palace of Westminster would become a goal.
The iconoclasm of the English civil wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
He may sacrifice himself to the wrong Cromwell for the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, during the previous century.
The magnificent depiction of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is a proof of the 19th century opinion and part of the historiography of a figure that many consider worthy to celebrate.
As Mr. Goldsmith pointed out to The Sunday Telegraph: "Many consider Cromwell, perhaps more in the late 19th century than at present, a defender of parliament from external pressure, in this case, it is clear, the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate description is a matter of continuing the historical debate.
What is true is that the conflict of the mid-seventeenth century has shaped the further development of our nation, and Cromwell is a recognisable figure representing a face of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and commemorating."
A killer pig attacks a Chinese rancher
A pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwestern China, according to local media.
The man, identified only by his last name "Yuan", was found dead with a severed artery and covered in blood near a well in the Liupanshui market in Guizhou province, as the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs from a well in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly traveled with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that the door to a nearby well was open.
He said there was a big pig in the well with blood in his mouth.
The forensic examination confirmed that the nearly 250-pound pig had attacked the rancher to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bleeding and broken,” the cousin, who is referred to by his last name, “Wu,” told The Guiyang Evening News.
The security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market Thursday at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told The Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from attacking anyone else, while police collected evidence on the spot.
It appears that Yuan’s family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although they are rare, this is not the first time a pig attacks a person.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm, leaving the man seriously injured.
Ten years earlier, a nearly 295-pound pig cornered a rancher on his tractor until his wife scared the animal.
After pigs were eaten by an Oregon rancher in 2012, a Manitoba rancher told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “shooter.”
“They’re just playing.
They are like children, very curious... their intention is not to do harm.
What needs to be done is to have proper respect for them," he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will leave widespread heavy rains in the southwestern U.S.
As expected, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the coldest waters of Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will leave torrential rains throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa caused wind gusts of more than 136 km/h, a Category 1 hurricane, from Sunday at five in the morning (Eastern time) and was located almost 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia (Mexico).
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, in the Pacific Ocean, low pressures are beginning to generate, moving eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to propel the intense tropical rains northward toward the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will leave more than 25 centimeters of rain in some areas of Mexico on Monday.
Finally, when the tropical rains collide with the low pressure that is approaching, there will be widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 2 and 10 centimeters of rain will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
The intense tropical rains will cause rainfall of almost 5 to 8 centimetres per hour in specific areas, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most of Arizona.
Due to the scattered nature of tropical rains, sudden floods with rapidly worsening conditions may occur.
Because of this threat of tropical torrential rains, it is not recommended to venture into the desert on foot at all.
Heavy rains could turn the canyons into brackish rivers and storms will cause ragged winds and dust clouds locally.
The approaching low pressures will leave heavy rains in specific parts of the southern California coast.
The torrential rains may leave up to nearly two centimeters of water, which could cause small debris flows and make roads slippery.
It would be the first torrential rains in the region during the wet season.
Some scattered tropical raindrops will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before rain becomes widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and throughout Wednesday.
In October, we will be able to observe some intense temperature changes in the U.S. due to the cooling of the Arctic and the warmth of the tropics.
Sometimes, this involves drastic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of these temperature differences is what will happen across the center of the U.S. on Sunday.
There will be a nearly 7-degree difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the prolonged summer heat will try to recover and expand again.
In much of the central and eastern U.S., a warm start to October is expected, with widespread temperatures around 26 degrees from the Southern Plain to parts of the Northeast.
On Tuesday, temperatures of up to 26 degrees, about 12 degrees above average, could be reached in New York.
Our long-term forecast shows high above-average temperature probabilities for the east of the USA during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's appearance
More than 20 million people followed the heartbreaking testimony that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of alleged sexual assault in the 1980s, gave on Thursday on six television networks.
Meanwhile, politics remained stale and the media disrupted their usual schedule to broadcast Friday’s latest news: an agreement designed by Arizona Senator Jeff Blake for the FBI to conduct an investigation into the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he is absolutely certain that Kavanaugh touched her in a drunken state and that he tried to take her clothes off at a high school party.
During his impassioned testimony, Kavanaugh said he was absolutely sure that had not happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people who commented on Nielsen on Friday have seen it.
The company counted the average audience on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available to other channels that broadcast it, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
In addition, Nielsen usually has some trouble calculating how many people see something in the office.
To put it in perspective, it is an audience similar to that of an American football game of the playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose Tertullians have strongly supported Kavanaugh’s nomination, fueled the leading channel, with an average of 5.69 million viewers during a full-day appearance, Nielsen said.
ABC took second place, with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
After the appearance, there was still a great deal of interest.
Flake was the central character in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying it would vote in Kavanaugh’s favor, on Friday morning CNN and CBS cameras captured how some protesters shouted at him as he tried to climb a lift to attend a court appearance.
While receiving these accusations, broadcast live by CNN, he was shot.
“Looking at my face,” said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He continued, “You have power when there are so many women who don’t have it.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and, before the elevator doors closed, that he would count more things in his appearance before the Commission.
Cable and broadcast television broadcast it all live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee had to vote to propose Kavanaugh’s Senate candidacy for the vote.
However, Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the allegations made against the candidate over the next week, which some Democrats had been calling for.
Flake was convinced, in part, by the conversations he had had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and several senators later, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was critical, as it was clear that Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without that investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of ‘making politics’ with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics with her plan to leave the European Union of “making politics” with Britain’s future and undermining the national interest in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview published alongside his on the newspaper's cover, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson insisted on his attack on Chequers' alleged Brexit plan, stating that a proposal for Britain and the EU to charge each other's tariffs was "totally absurd."
Wayde Murder: Police Arrest Dyteon Simpson as Suspect in LSU Player's Death
Police have arrested a suspect for the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player, during a shooting.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on a second-degree murder charge, according to the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Authorities released a video of the clash between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses at the crime scene and said they had found Simpson's DNA in them, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, police say they admitted to shooting Wayde.
A bond of $350,000 has been established, according to the defense.
The Baton Rouge District Court of Instruction issued a preliminary report Friday in which it indicated that the cause of death had been a gunshot wound to the back of the head.
The department recognizes the merits of the Louisiana State Police fugitive unit, the State Police forensics lab, Southern University police, and citizens for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, LSU’s sports director, thanked the area’s police forces for their “diligence and pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The player, who measured more than two meters, grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He had averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in a game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said his team is "devastated" and "in shock" by Wayde's death.
“These are the things that people always care about,” Wade said.
A volcano casts ash in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the neighborhoods south of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after the crater showed activity and recorded 183 gas and ash emissions in 24 hours.
The center recorded several tremors and tremors.
On social media, the images showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of vehicles in neighborhoods in Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since a 7.1-magnitude earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police face Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence referendum
Six people were arrested Saturday in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with anti-riot protesters as thousands took part in opposition demonstrations coinciding with the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarised referendum on secession.
A group of hooded separatists who had been cut off by rioters threw them eggs and powder paint, creating dark clouds of dust in the streets, which are usually filled with tourists.
Clashes also occurred in later hours and police used clubs to contain the fight.
For several hours, pro-independence groups, with messages such as “neither forget nor forgive”, confronted unionist protesters with the cry of “Viva Espa<0xC3><0xB1>a”.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests, according to local media.
Tensions remain high in this region a year after the October 1 vote, considered illegal by Madrid but held by Catalan separatists.
Voters overwhelmingly chose independence, although participation was low, as people who were against secession largely boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to block voting at polling stations across the region, where violent clashes took place.
Pro-independence groups camped out on Friday night to avoid a demonstration of support for the National Police.
The demonstration continued, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who was attending the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer had any hope of Catalonia becoming independent.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy for being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite achieving a vital, albeit narrow, victory in last December’s regional elections, pro-Catalan parties have struggled to retain momentum this year as many of their best-known leaders, whether in self-imposed exile or detained, are awaiting trial for their role in organizing the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in support of police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians from both sides.
"It's getting more and more tense," he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would participate in next year’s European Parliament elections.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the regression in democratic values and the repression we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: men arrested for stabbing a house with a car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after repeatedly ramming a Londonderry house into a car.
The incident occurred at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday at Ballynagard Crescent.
Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the entrances and the building itself.
At some point, he may have shot himself in the car with a crossbow.
A Menga attack gives Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
A promoted Livingston impressed the Rangers by scoring the second loss for Steven Gerrard in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's attack made the difference; Gary Holt's went up one spot, with the Hibernian in second place.
This season, the Gerrards have not yet achieved any away victory and next Sunday they face the Hearts, leaders of the table with eight points advantage.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday in the Europa League.
In the meantime, Livingston are extending their winning streak in the division to six games. Holt, head coach, has not yet tasted defeat since he replaced Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lets opportunities pass in front of a hard-hitting visitor
Holt’s team had to have gone one step ahead long before scoring, causing all sorts of problems to the Rangers for their direct play.
Scott Robinson overtook the defense, but failed his attempt in front of goal, and then Alan Lithgow was shot off after innings to finish Craig Halkett's head center in front of goal.
The host team was content to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that they could cause visitors problems with stopped ball plays.
That’s how the decisive goal came about.
The Rangers gave them a free-kick and Livingston sought an entry, with a combined play by Declan Gallagher and Robinson for Menga, which hit the ball and scored from the center of the area.
At the time, the Rangers dominated possession, but failed to pass the defense of the host and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was quite calm.
That game continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stoppage of Kelly.
Rangers goaltender Allan McGregor rejected a shot from Scott Pittman in one shot, and Lithgow stayed away from another Livingston play.
In the Livingston area, long passes were constantly entering, but they were always cleared; two penalty requests were rejected, one after Halkett's entry over substitute Glenn Middleton and the other by one hand.
"Phenomenal" by Livingston (analysis)
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Stadium
A phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
The unanimous opinion is that they made an excellent game that continued to exceed expectations of an upward trajectory.
His playing style and staff have barely experienced changes since his rise, but this is largely due to Holt’s way of reinforcing the team since his arrival.
I had a lot of heroes.
Halkett, the team captain, was huge and led a magnificently organized defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on alert at all times.
However, the Rangers lacked inspiration.
Although they had very good times with Gerrard, they were short.
They failed to materialize the moves, as they only managed to get into the opposite field once, which is a wake-up call to the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan has received an ambiguous reception in Cologne
On Saturday, September 29, there were smiles and a blue sky during the breakfast of the leaders of Turkey and Germany in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of re-establishing relations between NATO allies.
They have discussed issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed to Cologne to inaugurate a huge new mosque.
The city hosts the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police claimed security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many sympathizers stood nearby to see its president.
Hundreds of opponents of Erdogan, many of them Kurds, were also heard condemning both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to receive him into the country.
These manifestations reflect how divisive this visitor is, received as a hero by some German Turks and considered an autocrat by others.
Traffic accident in Deptford: a cyclist dies after colliding with a vehicle
A cyclist has died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwookd Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 a.m.
The driver of the car stopped and the cyclist was taken care of by paramedics, but he died right there.
The accident comes after another cyclist died after being run over by a vehicle that broke out on Childers Street, nearly two kilometers from the scene of Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roads have been cut and buses diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured After Riots
Six prison officials have been injured in an altercation at a high-security men’s prison, according to the prison’s management.
The riots began at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire around 9:30 a.m. on Sunday and are still ongoing.
Specialists of an elite team (called "Tornado") are in charge of controlling the altercations, in which eight inmates participate and which affect a pavilion.
The officers were assisted by minor injuries to the face on the spot.
A prison service spokesman said: “Specialized prison personnel have been deployed to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison.
Six staff members have received health care for injuries.
In our prisons, violence is not tolerated and we make it clear that those responsible will be put in the hands of the police and could spend more time between bars.”
Long Lartin Prison is home to more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison director had received hospital medical assistance after a prisoner attacked him.
In addition, in October last year riot police were asked to go to prison to deal with a serious altercation in which prison staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flash floods (arid areas could benefit)
It’s unusual for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that’s exactly what could happen early next week when the last collections of Hurricane Rosa pass through the southwest of the desert, with the risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood alerts for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada and southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to head directly to Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving rain at the end of Monday.
The Phoenix National Weather Service said in a tweet that only "ten hurricanes had maintained their tropical storm or depression status within a 321-kilometer radius of Phoenix since 1950.
In 1967, Hurricane Katrina approached nearly 65 kilometers from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict between 5 and 10 centimeters of torrential rain, which can reach 15 centimeters in isolated areas of the Mogoll<0xC3><0xB3>n Scarf, in Arizona.
It is likely to fall between 2 and 5 centimeters of rain, with the possibility of reaching 10 in isolated places, in other areas of the southwest of the desert, including the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin.
In places that are not at risk of sudden flooding, the Rosa rains can be considered a blessing, as the region is affected by drought.
Although a flood is a very serious matter, some of these torrential rains are likely to be beneficial due to the drought conditions currently being experienced in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category, as reported on weather.com.
First, the itinerary of Hurricane Rosa will hit the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Rosa, which on Sunday morning will still have a hurricane force with maximum gusts of 136 kilometers per hour, is 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia (Mexico) and moves north at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm is finding colder waters in the Pacific, so it is losing strength.
Thus, it is expected to rain in Mexico with the intensity of a tropical storm throughout the afternoon of Monday.
Heavy torrential rains could fall in parts of Mexico, which are at considerable risk of flooding.
“We expect torrential rains of between 7 and 15 centimetres from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with the possibility of reaching 25 centimetres,” according to weather.com.
Rosa will then head north from that Mexico as a tropical storm, before arriving at the Arizona border in the early hours of Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, then travel through Arizona to southern Utah at the last hour of Tuesday night.
“The main danger for Rosa or her remains is heavy torrential rain in Baja California, northwest Sonora and southwest U.S. desert,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause dangerous flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, as well as landslides in mountain areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old have been arrested as suspects in an attempted murder after another 16-year-old man was found with gunshot wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m. on Saturday.
He was transferred to a hospital, where he remains "stable".
A 17-year-old, two 18- and one 20-year-old were arrested that same night in the Radstock area of Avon, according to Somerset Police.
The agents have appealed to anyone who may have recorded what happened with the phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh “suffered the meanness and anger” of the Democratic Party
“To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote against the Democratic Party’s ruthless and outrageous tactics,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has "suffered the meanness and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, emphatically denying Christine Blasey Ford’s allegation that she had been sexually assaulted decades ago as a teenager.
Ford also testified at the hearing on this charge.
On Saturday, the president said that on that day, “Americans saw the cunning, quality, and courage” of Kavanaugh.
“To vote to confirm Judge Kavanaugh is to vote to confirm one of the most accomplished legalists of our time, a lawyer with an admirable record in the service of the public,” he told his West Virginia supporters.
The president made indirect references to Kavanaugh’s candidacy by talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections of our lives.
I’m not running, but it’s a race,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going from place to place fighting to get great candidates.”
Trump claimed the Democrats are embarking on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
The first key procedural vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's appointment is expected to take place no later than Friday, a senior Republican Party leadership official told CNN.
Hundreds of dead in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami, the number is on the rise
At least 384 people have died and many have been swept away by the huge waves sweeping the beaches after a strong earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered to celebrate a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when waves of up to six meters reached the coast at dusk, dragging many to death and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami occurred after an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When it was warned yesterday that a tsunami could occur, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so they were victims,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), told a press conference.
"The tsunami didn't come alone, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it devastated everything on land," said Nugroho, who said the tsunami had moved through the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
He also added that some people had climbed trees to escape the tsunami and had survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the agency showed the destruction of many buildings and shops, broken and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Replicas continued to hit the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
The Agency for the Evaluation and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s big earthquake was 200 times higher than that of the atomic bomb that fell on Hiroshima in World War II.
He added that the city’s geography, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, may have magnified the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "important" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said the bodies of some of the victims were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings, and 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be higher along the 300 km of coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the earthquake’s epicenter.
The communications "were totally paralyzed and there was no information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"There are more than 300,000 people living there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could be much worse,” he said.
On Saturday, the agency received much criticism for failing to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials say the waves had already reached the coast when the alert was issued.
In a recording captured by an amateur and shared on social media, a man is heard standing on the top floor of a building warning people on the street that a tsunami was approaching.
In a matter of minutes, a wall of water hits the coast, carrying buildings and cars in front.
Reuters was unable to validate the material immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major blackout that cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue work.
The army began sending cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but the evacuees still need food and other commodities.
The city’s airport has reopened for relief work only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo has a scheduled visit to Paul's evacuation centers on Sunday.
The number of victims of the Indonesian tsunami is more than 800.
It's a very bad thing.
Although Donggala’s World Vision staff have arrived safely in the city of Palu, where employees take refuge under tarpaulins installed in the garden of their offices, they have seen a devastating panorama on their way, Mr. Doseba said.
“I was told that they had seen many houses destroyed,” he said.
It's a very bad thing.
Even as aid groups set in motion the gears of disaster assistance, some people lamented that they were not allowing the movement to Palu of experienced co-operators.
Under Indonesian law, foreign funding, supplies and staffing can only be used if the affected site is declared a national disaster zone.
And that hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a Red Cross spokesman in Indonesia.
“As soon as the government says it considers it a national disaster, we can start providing international aid, but it hasn’t happened yet.”
Falling the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the people who were still missing were still hoping that their loved ones would be the miracles that would shed some light on the devastating stories that write natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small child was taken out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under the rubble for two days next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, an instructor on Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier that month in Indonesia.
Others who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel, Mr. Mandagi included, were his students.
“From my experience in the paragliding field, I carry my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon recalled how, in the hours following the news that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed in the paragliding community, he had sent desperate WhatsApp messages to Palu’s competitors, who were participating in the beach festival.
However, his messages showed only one check mark in gray, not two in blue.
“I think that means the messages weren’t delivered,” he said.
Thieves take $26,750 while recharging an ATM in Newport on the Levee
On Friday morning, thieves raided a Brink employee recharging an ATM in Newport on the Levee, taking $26,750, according to a Newport Police Department press release.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM located in the leisure center and was preparing to recharge it with more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the note.
While he was busy, another man “came running after Brink’s employee” and stole a bag of money destined for the recharge.
According to the note, there are witnesses who saw several suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about their identities should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is going to be called Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday: "The person previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has long been nicknamed Ye, a name he used as the title for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album, Yandhi.
It replaces singer Ariana Grande, who had to cancel her performance for "emotional reasons," as the show's creator commented.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West had previously said that the word had religious significance to him.
“I think it’s the most used word in the Bible, where it means ‘you’,” West said earlier this year as he talked about the album’s title with radio host Big Boy.
"It's you, it's us, it means us.
It went from being Kanye, which means ‘the one’, to Ye, a reflection of our good, bad and confused things, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of the many famous rappers who has changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
A former West collaborator, JAY-Z, has used his name in uppercase or lowercase, with or without a script.
Mexican AMLO vows not to use army against civilian population
Andres Manuel L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador, Mexican president-elect, has vowed never to use the military against the civilian population, as the 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliation against students in the country approaches.
On Saturday, L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador promised in Plaza Tlatelolco that he would “never use the army to repress the people of Mexico.”
On October 2, 1968, troops fired at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were entrenching themselves throughout Latin America.
L<0xC3><0xB3>pez Obrador is committed to supporting young Mexicans by giving monthly grants to those who study and opening more free public universities.
He claimed that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities led young people to integrate into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for I.A.
Now that China is more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its investment in research in this field, says Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and I.A. professional who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments then emerge as I.A.-related announcements from various parts of the U.S. government, even when, in general, the U.S. lacks an official I.A. strategy.
Meanwhile, China unveiled its plan last year: its goal is to become the No. 1 in innovation in AI by 2030.
“Duplicateing the budget for I.A.’s research would be a good start, given that all other countries go way behind the U.S. We’re looking at the next breakthrough in the I.A. field,” Lee says.
Double funding means double the chances that the next big achievement in I.A. will be achieved in the U.S., as Lee stated in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's leading I.A. companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an I.A. system that beat Othello's best American player, later executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee gave recognition to previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the DARPA Robotics Challenge, and asked when it would be next, which would identify the next generation of visionaries.
In the U.S., researchers often have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
“It’s not China that is taking the academic leaders; it’s the corporations,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired prominent people from universities to work at I.A.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. step up its I.A. initiatives.
“I think doctors in I.A. should have permanent residency cards automatically,” he said.
The State Council of China presented its Plan for the Development of the Next Generation of Artificial Intelligence in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China funds people from academic institutions just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations fund American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to attract partners from the industrial and academic fields. For its part, the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
In addition, this month DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the National Science Foundation, it currently invests more than $100 million a year in I.A. research.
Meanwhile, U.S. legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not carried out any action in months.
The Macedonians decided in a referendum on whether they will change the name of their country
The people of Macedonia decided in a referendum held on Sunday on whether their name will be changed to "Republic of North Macedonia", a gesture that would resolve a decades-long conflict with Greece, which had blocked their bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbor is a claim to its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments reached an agreement on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic population, mostly in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether participation will reach the minimum 50% required for the referendum to be considered valid.
In the ballot, the question was posed: "Are you in favor of joining NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, claim it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the countries emerging from the disintegration of Yugoslavia, to try to gain access to bodies such as the EU and NATO.
"Today I have come to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the auspices of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all," said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although it will not be legally binding, many Members of Parliament have said that they will respect the outcome of the vote to make it decisive.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The State Electoral Commission stated that, at one in the afternoon, no irregularities had been reported.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% of the last parliamentary elections held in 2016, when 66% of registered voters cast their vote.
“I have come to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who was voting in the capital, Skopje.
Zoran Zaev, Macedonia’s prime minister, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko cast their vote in Macedonia’s referendum on a name change that would pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica (Macedonia) on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov prepared a small stage and withdrew chairs in front of tents planted by those who were going to boycott the referendum.
“We are in favor of joining NATO and the EU, but we want to do it with our heads held high, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they do not want us to enter Macedonia, we can establish relations with other countries, such as China and Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would provide the investment Macedonia so badly needs, whose unemployment rate is above 20%.
"I think the vast majority will be in favour, as more than 80% of citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a positive outcome would be a “confirmation of our future.”
A poll published last Monday by the Institute for Policy Research said 30 to 43 percent of voters were going to participate in the referendum, which means less participation than required.
Another survey conducted by Telma TV, from Macedonia, revealed that 57% of respondents had planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70% said they would vote in favour.
For the referendum to be considered a success, the turnout must be 50% plus one vote.
If it fails, it would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it came to power in May last year.
Watch this: Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero, from Manchester City, dodges all Brighton’s defense to score a goal
Sergio Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero and Raheem Sterling smashed Brighton's defence in the 2-0 win that Manchester City won on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
For Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero, it was ridiculously easy to score a goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine midfielder received a pass in the midfield at the beginning of the play.
He ran between three Brighton defenses before entering the open field.
Once there, he was surrounded by four green T-shirts.
He dodged a defense before overtaking several more on the edge of the Brighton area.
He made a pass to the left, where Sterling was.
The English forward used his first touch in the area to return the ball to Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero, who hit him with his right foot to avoid goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot that reached the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems in his foot," City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We said he would play between 55 and 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at the time.”
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial lead in the Premier League contest.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
In that play, Ag<0xC3><0xBC>ero received the ball well within the Brighton territory.
He made a nice left flank ball pass for Leroy Sane.
Sane gave him a few touches before leading Sterling to the second pole.
The Sky Blues forward threw the ball into the net just before breaking out of the bounds.
City face Hoffenheim in a Champions League group match on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to water the party to the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from the playoff game, there was no reason to force another opening.
Still, the always-competitive Scherzer hopes to step on the mound Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if these, who triumphed against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West Division, still have opportunities in the playoffs.
The Rockies secured at least one wildcard spot thanks to a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but are still chasing their first division title.
“Even if we don’t play anything, we can at least tread the rubber with the certainty that the Denver crowd will be excited and that the other team will probably play at the highest level I’ve faced this year.
Why wouldn’t you want to participate?”
The Nationals still have to announce an opener for Sunday, but it seems they are inclined to let Scherzer pitch in that situation.
Scherzer, who would make his opening number 34, made a practice session on Thursday and will return to his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington's right-hander record is 18 wins and 7 losses, with an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts with 2/3 in 220 innings.
Trump there and meeting in West Virginia
The president made indirect references to the situation around Brett Kavanaugh, his selection for the Supreme Court, in talking about the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
“In November, everything we’ve done is at stake.
There are five weeks left for one of the most important elections of our lives.
It’s one of the most important. I’m not running, but it’s a race, that’s why I’m going from place to place fighting for great candidates,” he said.
“We have this terrible radical group of Democrats, it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by all necessary means, you see meanness, evil.
They don’t care who they hurt or who they have to go over to get power and control, that’s what they want, power and control. And we’re not going to give it to them.”
The Democrats, he said, are embarking on a mission of “resistance and obstruction.”
"We've seen it these last four days," he said, saying the Democrats were "angry, they were bad, horrible and fake."
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee by appointing Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who received booze from the public.
"Do you remember his answer?
Do you filter the document?
Mmm, Mmm, what?
No, no, I'm waiting for an answer. His body language was terrible, the worst I've ever seen."
The Labour Party already encompasses a wide range of opinions.
It is intolerant of people who say what they think
When Momentum activists from my local party voted to censor me, I was hardly surprised.
After all, I am the last of a line of Labour MPs to be told he is not welcome, and just for saying what we think.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, has received similar treatment as being categorically against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure criticized me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
I disagreed with the importance of a responsible economic policy, in terms of national security, on Europe, and it is ironic that these were issues where Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
As stated in the notice of Friday’s Nottingham East Labour Party meeting, “we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive.”
For most of the eight years I’ve been a Member of Parliament for the local Labour Party, that’s exactly what the Friday night meetings of the General Committee have been.
Unfortunately, this is not the current tone of many meetings and the promise of a “kinder and kinder” policy is already more than forgotten, if that actually applied at some point.
It is increasingly clear that dissenting opinions are not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on whether party leaders consider it acceptable or not.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues with whom he previously thought he shared a similar political vision began to expect him to radically change his mind and adopt positions he would never have agreed with, either on national security or on the EU’s single market.
Whenever I speak in public, no matter what I say, there is a diatribe of insults on social networks demanding my withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the center, telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party.
I'm not the only one who's experienced it.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues, as comments about me tend to be political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, but never run away.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is the normalization of insults.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer have that wide range of opinions and, with every "censorship" motion or every change in the selection rules, the party becomes narrower.
In the last two years, I have received many tips that advised me to keep my head down and not make myself heard so much and that would "be good".
But I didn’t get into politics to do that.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a high school student, motivated by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left my comprehensive school classroom literally in ruins, I have tried to support the improvement of public services for those who need them most, either as a councilman or as a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ideas, not even in the last election.
It is impossible for anyone in Nottingham East to ignore my political stances or areas where I disagreed with current leaders.
The only thing I would say to those who promoted Friday’s motion is that I don’t understand this desire to waste time and energy with questions about my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party when the country heads for a Brexit that will affect homes, businesses and public services.
The real message is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for voters, whether from the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or any political opportunism will prevent me from acting according to what I believe is best for all of you.

Ayr 38 - Melrose 17: an undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
Two tries at the end of the game may have decided the final result to some extent, but Ayr certainly deserved the win in this entertaining Tennent's Premiership day game.
They now top the table and are the only undefeated team out of the ten that participate.
In the end, it was the superiority of his defense, as well as his ability to better seize the opportunities, that gave the victory to the local team, so coach Peter Murchie had every right to be happy.
“We’ve been tested in every game and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie, of Melrose, commented: “The Ayr deserve recognition, they took advantage of the opportunities better than we did.”
Grant Anderson's test in the 14th minute, converted by Frazier Climo, put the Ayr ahead; but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, loan from the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to take advantage of this disadvantage of the opponent and Jason Baggot got an unconverted test.
Climo extended the advantage of Ayr with a penalty. Earlier, just in the half-time, he scored and converted a solo test, which left the score in 17-5 in favor of Ayr at rest.
However, the Melrose started the second part well and Patrick Anderson's essay, converted by Baggot, reduced this difference to five points.
Then there was a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who they had to pull out on a stretcher, and, as the game resumed, Ayr advanced with a Stafford McDowall trial converted by Climo.
The yellow card to Blair Macpherson, captain of the Ayr, allowed Melrose to retake that they had one more man with an unconverted essay by Bruce Colvine, at the end of a period of enormous pressure.
However, the locals recovered and, when the yellow card was shown to Struan Hutchinson by scoring Climo without the ball, from the penalty line, MacPherson made an essay when he was in the back of the advancing maul.
Climo converted it, as he had been doing almost since the game resumed, after Kyle Rowe received the ball sent by David Armstrong with a kick and sent the winger Gregor Henry to the bottom to do the fifth rehearsal of the premises.
The protagonist of Still Game wants to orient his career towards the restoration sector
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, seems determined to move into the catering sector after it turns out he has been appointed director of a restaurant chain.
The 56-year-old actor is Jack Jarvis on the famous BBC show, who writes and co-stars with his long-time comedy partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the ninth season will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is making plans for his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, though a Scottish Sun source said Kiernan wanted to get involved in Glasgow’s “flowering restoration market.”
"The sea belongs to us": a Bolivia without a coastline hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors guard a naval headquarters in La Paz.
In public buildings there are blue flags.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, naval bases display the motto: "The sea belongs to us by right,
“Recovering it is a duty.”
Throughout Bolivia, a land without sea, they still vividly remember the coast lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources that took place in the 19th century, in addition to the desire to re-navigate the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes may be the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits an International Court of Justice resolution by October 1, after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and, of course, is waiting for the result with a positive vision,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will watch the International Court of Justice’s ruling on large screens spread across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia’s claim that, after decades of intermittent talks, Chile has an obligation to negotiate to grant Bolivia a sovereign exit to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic indigenous president of Bolivia, who is waging a controversial battle for re-election next year, also has a lot to say about Monday’s resolution.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean,” he promised at the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that it is unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia and that the situation would change little if it did.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice’s ruling comes just six months after the final allegations indicates that the case “wasn’t complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
Far from promoting Bolivia’s cause, the past four years may have hindered it.
“The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
In addition, he suggested that Morales’ belligerent rhetoric has undermined any residual Chilean goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk at some point, but it will be extremely difficult to hold talks after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was unusually fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will be offered "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and the possibility of "ending 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America, would use the maritime issue as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean,” he added.
“The resolution is an opportunity to see that we have to leave the past behind.”
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can rely on the U.S.
Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, says his nation will never be the first to carry out nuclear disarmament if it can’t trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to honour the promises made during a summit held in Singapore among rival leaders.
His comments come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears set to resume stalled nuclear diplomatic talks more than three months after this summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong U.
Ri points out that the continuation of continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration that ends the Korean War to subdue the North, is a “chimera.”
Washington is wary of accepting the declaration without Pyongyang making any significant disarmament moves sooner.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold another summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism about Pyongyang’s seriousness in renouncing an arsenal that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare another summit among the leaders.
Paris fashion shows reveal the latest line of huge hats that are about to land on a shopping street near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or completely protect yourself from the sun, look no further.
Valentino and Thom Browne’s designers unveiled a set of eccentric large-sized hats for their spring-summer 2019 collection on the catwalk, dazzled by the style of Paris Fashion Week.
Impossible hats have flooded Instagram this summer and these designers have brought their spectacular creations to the catwalk.
Valentino’s most outstanding piece was a beige hat with a wide wing adorned with feathers that wrapped the heads of the models.
Other large complements were watermelons with jewelry, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also presented a selection of bizarre masks, just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had sewn lips and were more reminiscent of Hannibal Lecter than the haute couture.
One creation was reminiscent of a full diving team, snorkeling and glasses included, while another looked like a melted ice cream cone.
If you like large size fashion, you are in luck.
Style hunters predict that huge hats might start to show up on the shopping streets.
The big hats arrive stepping strong by the hand of "The Bomb", with a straw hat with a wing of more than 60 centimeters used by all, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind this impractical hat that flooded social media presented another great creation on the catwalk: a straw beach bag as big as the swimsuit model that wore it.
The dark orange raffia bag, decorated with raffia fringes and a white leather handle, was the main piece of the La Riviera de Jacquemus collection for the spring-summer 2019 season at Paris Fashion Week.
As famous fashion designer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "Next summer, I hope to see huge beach hats and bags on the shopping streets. Since the designer has had a big impact, it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large accessories."
John Edward: Language skills are critical for the world’s citizens
Scotland’s independent educational centres have a track record of academic excellence that has continued in 2018 with another set of extraordinary results in exams that is reinforced by the individual and collective successes gained in the fields of sport, art, music and other community projects.
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland, these centres, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to deliver the best level of service to students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students to continue their higher education studies, for the career they choose and for the place they occupy as citizens of the world.
As an educational sector that can design and implement an adapted curriculum, it is observed that modern languages remain a popular and desired subject in the centers.
As Nelson Mandela said, “If you speak to a man in a language that he understands, the message comes to his head.
If you speak to him in his language, he comes to his heart.”
This is a powerful reminder that if you want to build relationships and build trust with people from other countries, you can’t rely solely on English.
If we take into account the recent results of this year’s exams, we can observe that languages are at the highest of the classification tables, with the rates of approved being the highest in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained an A, the highest grade.
The data, collected from the 74 centers that are part of the SCIS, showed that 72% of the students obtained an A in Mandarin, while 72% of those who studied German, 69% of those who studied French and 63% of those who studied Spanish also got an A.
This shows that Scotland’s independent schools support foreign languages as a fundamental competency that both children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
At present, it is considered that, as a subject, languages are at the same level as CTIM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and everywhere.
A 2014 survey by the United Kingdom’s Employment and Skills Commission found that, for employers’ reasons for the difficulties they encountered in filling jobs, 17 % were attributed to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly indispensable in preparing young people for their future careers.
The potential job opportunities that require languages are increasing, so these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of the career that someone chooses, if they have learned a second language, they will have a real advantage in the future thanks to a competition like this, which will last a lifetime.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries will allow that person to automatically advance to the competition.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75% of them did not speak any foreign language well enough to have a conversation, and the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage, 15%, was French.
For this reason, investing in language teaching is now important for today’s children.
If they know several languages, especially those of developing economies, children will be equipped to have better opportunities to find quality employment.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Some centres will focus on the more classical modern languages, while others will teach the languages considered most important for the UK by 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the interests of a child, in independent schools you can always choose between several languages taught by specialized teaching staff in this field.
Scotland’s independent education centres devote all their efforts to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds for them.
At the moment, it is undeniable that, in a global business environment, languages continue to have a vital importance for the future of the country, so this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered "competences for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer these options, diversity and excellence to young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Colleges.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait for fans to see LeBron James debut in his first game with the Los Angeles Lakers is about to end.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play the opening game of the preseason on Sunday against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, it remains to be determined how many minutes he will play.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James was likely to play for a limited number of minutes.
After a training session earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers’ six-game preseason program.
“At this stage of my career, I don’t need pre-season games to prepare,” he said.
Trump rally time in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump kicks off a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of Trump’s five rallies scheduled for next week, including stops at places with supporters like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With his candidate’s confirmation vote to cover the pending Supreme Court vacancy, Trump aims to gain support for the next midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time is the Trump rally in West Virginia tonight and how can you watch it online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch it online through a live stream on YouTube.
Trump is likely to comment on this week’s appearances of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who strained over allegations of sexual misconduct and have been waiting for an early Senate confirmation vote for at least a week while the FBI investigates them.
However, the main goal of this series of rallies is to help Republicans facing the November elections take momentum.
President Trump’s campaign said the five rallies next week were intended to “encourage volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand the majorities they retain in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
"Congressional control is so crucial to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the campaign," a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Scheduled at Wheeling’s Wesbanco Arena stadium tonight’s rally could attract fans of “Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as have coverage in Pittsburgh’s media,” as reported by the West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in a month that Trump visits West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, a Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging behind in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and give him a boost in the polls," said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
Ryder Cup 2018: The U.S. team proves they dare to fight to keep hope alive for Sunday’s individual matches.
After three individual sessions, Saturday afternoon foursomes may be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging impulse pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, even more so in competitions like these.
So where would they say the momentum is now?
“They were taking us six points and now they’re taking us four, so I guess that can be considered a small boost,” Spieth said.
Europe has an advantage, of course: four points ahead with twelve more in play.
As Spieth points out, Americans feel they have some wind in their favor and plenty of reasons to be excited, among other reasons for the pair formed by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and scored three points out of four each.
Spieth has been lethal from tee to green and preaches by example.
The gutural shouts of celebration went up in volume as his round progressed, introducing a vital putt to tie the fourth game as he and Thomas went two down after two holes.
The putt that gave them the match in the 15th was received with a similar shout, from those who broadcast that they believe that the American team has not yet been left out.
"What needs to be done is to redouble our efforts and focus on the party," Spieth said.
That’s what these players have done.
18 holes to leave a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
The strange and adorable couple from Europe wears four out of four and nothing can go wrong with them.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but also avoided the bogeys on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and in the last nine holes on Friday morning.
That streak and the way his energy flows with the buzzing crowd make it clear that these are the players to beat on Sunday, and that there will be no other players as popular as Fleetwood and Molinari to seal a possible European victory when the sun sets at Le Golf National.
Preferably, the two at the same time in different holes.
Even so, it is still premature to speak of European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson dispatched Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the hero of the four morning balls, after partnering with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles in the first nine holes buried the Spanish and the Swedish in a hole from which they could not get out.
But on Sunday there will be no help to get out of the holes.
Fourballs and foursomes are fascinating to watch closely because they appreciate the interactions between couples, the advice they give and the advice they don’t give, and the way a strategy can change in an instant.
So far, Europe has played better as a team and has a big lead in the last day, but this foursomes session also showed that the U.S. team dares to fight, something that some, especially Americans, doubted.
Europe advances 10-6 on the last day of the Ryder Cup
Europe left with a good lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup, after finishing the fourballs and the foursomes with a result of 10-6 over the United States.
The motivated duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the race with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods, four points ahead of Le Golf National.
European Thomas Bjorn, trying to keep the trophy that they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an American team that made many mistakes during the morning fourballs, which ended 3-1.
The U.S. offered more resistance in the foursomes, winning two games, but failed to shorten distances.
American Jim Furyk needs to get eight points from Sunday’s 12 individual games to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight points, and he and Molinari, who were nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are the second pair to win four points in their first four Ryder Cup games.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, their magnificent union served to defeat a disheartened Woods and American rookie Bryson Decahmbeau by a resounding 5-4.
Woods, who hadn’t featured much in Saturday’s two games, had occasional moments of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 fourball and foursome games, and seven straight.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning fourballs, returned to be Henrik Stenson's partner in the foursomes, defeating Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, number one and number three in the world respectively, with a 2-1 result.
Although the day was nice and quiet in southwest Paris, Europe didn’t have it all on its side.
The three-time winner, Jordan Spieth, and Justin Thomas served as a reference to the Americans, scoring two points on Saturday.
They won an exciting 2-1 victory over Ian Poulter and Spanish Jon Rahm in the fourballs and then defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the initial two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, that a team recovered from a four-point difference in individual matches has only happened twice, although Furyk, as the trophy holder, only needs one draw to keep it.
Although they have been the second best for two days, it seems that carrying out a counterattack on Sunday is beyond their possibilities.
North Korea says “there’s no chance” they’ll disarm first unilaterally if they don’t have confidence
On Saturday, the North Korean foreign minister informed the United Nations that the continuation of the sanctions deepened his distrust in the United States and that there was no possibility that his country would unilaterally renounce nuclear weapons under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the international body's annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant goodwill measures" over the past year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling nuclear test facilities and committing to nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear technology.
“However, we do not receive any similar response from the United States,” he said.
“If we don’t have confidence in the United States, we can’t have confidence in our national security, and in those circumstances, there’s no chance that we’ll disarm unilaterally first.”
Although Ri repeated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s resistance to a “phased” denuclearization formula that rewards the country as it takes gradual steps, his statement is important as he did not without further rejection of unilateral denuclearization, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump following the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, when Kim pledged to work for the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula” and Trump guaranteed North Korea’s security.
North Korea has pursued the official end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must give up its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to ease international sanctions on North Korea.
“The United States has insisted on denuclearization in the first place and has increased pressure through sanctions in order to achieve its purpose in a coercive manner, even by objecting to a declaration of an end to the war,” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can make us fall on our knees is a chimera of people who don’t know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions deepens our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of the plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, announced by the American leader to the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings held between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea had been the party interested in denuclearization instead of the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not be in such a stalemate.”
Even so, the tone of Ri’s speech was radically different from last year’s speech when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to steer North Korea’s missiles toward U.S. soil after “evil president” Trump, on a suicide mission, called Kim a “rocket man.”
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea, praised Kim for his bravery in advancing disarmament, but said there was still much to be done and that sanctions needed to be continued until North Korea denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no set deadline for this: “We can take two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia claim that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its progress.
However, as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The imposition of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and without breach until we realize definitive and fully verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006, in an attempt to cut funding for Pyongyang's ballistic and nuclear missile programs.
Pompeo spoke with Ri outside the UN General Assembly and later said he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July saying there had been progress, but, a few hours later, North Korea denounced his "requirements as those of a mobster."
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States applied “appropriate measures.”
He said Kim had told him that the “corresponding measures” he was seeking were the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on how to get enough rest
Thanks to a new course being taught this year at Harvard University, all college students are sleeping longer in an attempt to fight the growing male culture of studying all night drinking caffeine.
One professor found that students at the world’s number one university often have no idea about basic self-care.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School, and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital designed the course, is believed to be the first of its kind in the U.S.
Her motivation for starting the course came after giving a talk about how sleep deprivation affects learning.
“At the end of the course, a girl came up and asked me why she just found out about this now, in her senior year.
He said no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, given for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance, as well as improving overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after discovering that students barely slept during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a bedroom, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, sneakers and books that inform them of the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on sports performance and the importance of establishing a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, embolism, depression, and cancer.
Then, a campus icon with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
“We know it’s not going to change students’ behavior instantly.
However, we believe that they have a right to know, just like anyone has a right to know the health effects of smoking tobacco,” added Professor Czeisler.
He claimed that the culture of pride in “staying up late at night” still exists and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure that students are subjected to meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Getting enough sleep and a good quality sleep should be the “secret weapon” of students to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety; even to avoid gaining weight, since sleep deprivation causes the brain to generate a feeling of hunger, that’s why they want to eat all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes the previous year during his first year at Harvard.
He noted that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to extend it to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all graduate students to complete a similar study program before joining the competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler’s recommendation is that students think about putting one alarm to go to bed and another to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of the “blue light” emitted by the screens of electrical appliances and LEDs, which can alter circadian rhythms, so they would end up having trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - Rangers 0: Menga's goal burys Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another episode of out-of-home depression when Dolly Menga's attack banished Steven Gerrard's disarticulated team to a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibroxs wanted their first win away from home since the February 4–1 win at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team defeated Gerrard's for the second time in 18 games as a coach, leaving his team eight points from the Hearts, loose leaders of the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga's attack came minutes before halftime and the Rangers' uninspired lineup was not up to par at all.
Now, the Rangers go down to sixth position, Livingston goes up to third, behind the Hibernian for the goal difference.
The Rangers may find themselves in more trouble, as line judge Calum Spence had to receive medical assistance for a head injury after someone allegedly threw an object from the visitor background.
Gerrard switched to eight of the holders who won the match against Ayr, entering the Scottish League Cup semi-finals.
Holt, for his part, pulled out the 11 Livingston players who scored a point for the Hearts last week and would have been delighted by the way his highly organized team drowned the opponents at all times.
The Rangers may have had more possession, but Livingston took better advantage of the ball when he had it.
They should have scored within two minutes of the start, when Menga made a space pass for Scott Pittman who passed between the defense, leaving him alone in front of Allan McGregor, but the midfielder sent her out.
Keaghan Jacobs made an in-depth foul for Captain Craig Halket, but his partner in defense, Alan Lithgow, could only send her off by the long stick.
The Rangers regained control, but there seemed to be more hope than conviction about their game in the last third.
There is no doubt that Alfredo Morelos felt that he had been penalized in the 15th minute of the match, when he and Steven Lawless collided, but referee Steven Thomson made deaf ears to the Colombian's request.
The Rangers scored two shots in the first half, but Ibrox's former goalie, Liam Kelly, barely found himself in trouble to deal with Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's boring pitch.
Although the goal scored in the 34th minute by Livingston came against all odds, no one can deny that they deserved it for the dedicated effort.
Again, the Rangers were unable to cope with Jacobs’s deep ball-stopping play.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball for Scott Robinson, who remained calm and passed it to Menga to score the goal.
At rest, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which had an almost immediate impact as the steering wheel passed to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly stepped out of his line to block him.
Still, Livingston continued to lead visitors exactly to the kind of game he liked, with Lithgow and Halkett clearing out one long pass after another.
Holt's could have taken more advantage in the final stages, but McGregor remained firm to reject Jacobs before Lithgow finished a corner head that didn't come in.
Rangers substitute Glen Middleton claimed a penalty towards the end of the game after an encounter with Jacobs, but, again, Thomson looked the other way.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from the Almanac section of "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, and counting... was born in Germany the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that culminated in the device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger, who has since become a pillar of science, also became a pillar of pop culture, as in the 1950 film “The Crowning Bells,” with actors Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in the seemingly incompatible roles of cowboy scientists:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, it's used to locate radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put on your headphones, you can hear the effect of the waves emitted by the radioactivity of the minerals.”
Evans: "It's like a radio!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, when he was about to turn 63.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” malignant cells and kill them.
As part of the treatment, the vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method requires the extraction of immune cells from a patient and altering them in the laboratory.
Thus, they can "see" a protein common to many cancers and re-inject them.
A vaccine trial is generating promising results in patients with different cancers.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells, saw how her ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method requires removing immune cells from a patient and altering them in the lab so they can “see” a protein common to many cancers, called HER2, and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 "promotes the growth of different types of cancer," such as breast, ovarian, lung, or colorectal cancer, Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach of taking immune cells from patients and “teaching” them to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a type of leukemia.

It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed at the Saturday Night Live studio after an erratic performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in the 2020 election.
After the third song of the night, called Ghost Town, during which he wore the cap with the Make America Great Again message, he began to depose against the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I often talk to a white person and he asks me how I can like Trump if he’s a racist.
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the Matt Damon sketch show in which the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanaugh’s statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not rebroadcast, comedian Chris Rock uploaded West's broncho recording to social media.
It’s not clear if Rock was trying to ridicule West with the publication.
In addition, West told the audience that he had had a bad time behind the scenes wearing that cap.
“They messed with me.
They told me not to go out with the cap on.
They messed with me!
And then they tell me I'm asleep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see how sleepy I am?” and added that he was “going to put on his superman cape, because that meant no one could tell him what to do.
Try it with love.”
His comments received public acquiescence on at least two occasions and SNL members appeared to be embarrassed, Variety reported, one person told the magazine: "The studio was totally silent."
West had been invited to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days ago.
West baffled many when he went on stage to sing I Love It dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from the leader of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR RESISTING AGAINST MUCH.
Karen Hunter, host of an interview show, tweeted that West was simply “being himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I choose NOT to reward someone (by buying their music or their clothes, or supporting their art) who I consider to be embracing and spreading a dangerous ideology to my community.
He's free.
We too,” he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that the name had been changed, saying he was now "the person previously known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His colleague, Snoop Dogg has also been called Snoop Lion, not to mention the missing music legend, Prince, who changed his name to a symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Charge of attempted murder by stabbing in a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear in the Belfast Court of First Instance on Monday.
Prosecutors will review the charges.
Kit Harington, Game of Thrones star, attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is famous for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series, Game of Thrones.
The 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the male hero, saying that those on-screen roles often passed on to young boys who had to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believes "something has gone wrong" and questioned how to address the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married her cast partner in Game of Thrones, Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that she thinks it's "quite important" to address this issue.
“Personally, it seems to me quite important right now, where have we gone wrong with masculinity?” he said.
"What have we been teaching men as they grew up, thinking about the problems we see now?"
Kit believes that television may have some responsibility for the growing toxic masculinity due to its so masculine characters.
And he continued, "What is innate and what is taught?
What is taught on television, and on the street, that makes young people feel that they have to be this concrete form of man?
I think that's one of the big questions of our time. How do we change it?
Because it is clear that something has gone wrong in the education of young people.”
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not participate in any Game of Thrones prequels or sequels when the series ends next summer, stating that he is "tired of battlefields and horses."
From November, Kit will star in True West, Sam Shepard’s theatrical play that tells the story of a movie producer and his brother, who is a thief.
Recently, the actor revealed that he believes meeting his wife Rose is the best thing he has ever pulled out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the show, so in that sense she has given me my future family and my life from now on,” she said.
Rose portrayed Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 on a farm belonging to Leslie’s family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% more new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
There are more than 820,000 people affected in the country, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, some 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of these were sexually infected, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people who contract HIV in this way has been reduced in its entirety, Chinese health authorities said at a congress in Yunnan province.
Every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increases by about 100,000 people.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but the LGBT collective suffers a lot of discrimination.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies have calculated that between 70% and 90% of men who have sex with other men will end up marrying women.
Many of the transmissions of diseases are due to not using adequate protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV drugs as part of an attempt to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies a member of her staff leaked data from Republican Party senators and says it is “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday criticized allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal data of three Republican Party U.S. senators on Wikipedia pages about lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat said those accusations were fueled by commentators and “extreme right” websites.
“Lies, lies and more vile lies,” Waters said in a Twitter post.
Allegedly, the published information included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
On Thursday, an unknown person from the Capitol posted the information on the Internet during a Senate panel session regarding allegations of sexual misconduct made against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak took place sometime after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative sites, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was associated with the Waters office and made public the data of a Waters staff member, according to the Capitol.
“This groundless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations, was not at all responsible for leaking this information.
This groundless allegation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters' statement sparked immediate criticism on the Internet, including that of former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
“Debunk this information with anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that not the temperance needed to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn’t do, they shouldn’t get angry.
He must not rebel.
He should not question the accuser's motives.
He must remain calm and serene.”
It appears Fleischer wanted to compare Waters’ reaction to Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom critics accused of looking too angry during Thursday’s appearance.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true, it’s very serious,” he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted “relevant authorities and law enforcement entities to these fraudulent allegations.”
"We will make sure that the authors are found out," he continued, "and that they are considered legally responsible for all these destructive and dangerous actions for all members of my staff."
Johnny English review: Rowan Atkinson's spy parody gets cut short
Now it has become a tradition to look for Brexit winks in any new film with a British approach. It seems that this is what to do with this new installment of the parody action and comedy franchise Johnny English, which began in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Returns.
Will this self-satisfied irony about how clearly crazy we are the nation’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his jumpy eyes and his inexpressive face, has renewed his license to step foot for the second time. Only his name already gives hints that, most of all, it is a comic creation designed for non-English-speaking cinematic territories.
Of course, he is the ridiculous secret agent who, despite his strange claims to throw away glamour, has a bit of Clouseau, a touch of Mr. Bean and a bit of that kind that played a single note on the theme of Fire Trucks that was played at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
In addition, at its origin it was based on the mysterious traveler and international man represented years ago by Atkinson in the already forgotten Barclaycard television ads, sowing chaos behind him.
In this last installment, there are one or two good moments.
I loved seeing Johnny English approaching a helicopter dressed in medieval armor as the propellers collided against the hull.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy comes into view, but the humor is rather short and strangely superfluous, especially now that "serious" movie franchises like 007 and Mission Impossible add comical ingredients seamlessly.
The humor seems more directed at children than adults and, to me, Johnny English’s absurd misadventures aren’t as witty and accurate as Atkinson’s silent jokes in Mr. Bean’s role.
Now, the repeated argument today is that Britain is in serious trouble.
A hacker has infiltrated Britain’s top-secret spy network, revealing the identities of all of his active agents in the face of the agent’s dismay on duty, a woefully small role for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the drop that fills the glass for the prime minister, a pompous, cornered character who is watching her political popularity sink: Emma Thompson gives her best in this character who’s almost like Theresa May, but the script doesn’t leave much room to work.
His intelligence advisers inform him that, as all active spies are in danger, he will have to resort to someone who is retired.
That has to be the clumsy Johnny English, who now teaches in a sleazy school, although he gives unofficial lessons on how to be a secret agent: there are some good jokes, as it is a spy academy similar to that of the Rock School.
English is moved to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunites with his long-suffering ex-girlfriend Bough, represented again by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a married man with a submarine captain, a nice role for which Vicki Pepperdine is not used enough.
Thus, the Batman and Robin who do things terribly wrong in His Majesty's Secret Service return to action, with the beautiful fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova, represented by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is falling into the dangerous clutches of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims she can solve Britain’s computer problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of absurd situations: they disguise themselves as waiters, set fire to an elegant French restaurant, unleash chaos by hiding in the luxurious yacht of Volta; in addition, English becomes pure anarchy by trying to use a virtual reality helmet to get acquainted with the interior of the house of Volta.
Definitely, they were thoroughly employed in that last sequence, but, funny as it is, the set still conveys a somewhat childish feeling.
A fairly regular product.
As with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help wondering if the British film industry couldn’t give Rowan Atkinson a role that would do true justice to his talent.
The Labour Party denies that it is working out a plan for the British to work four days a week, but they charge five
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is going to think of a radical plan with which the British would work four days a week, but charge five.
Supposedly, the party wants the owners of the companies to allocate the savings obtained thanks to the revolution in artificial intelligence (AI) to the workers, giving them an additional day off.
Thus, employees would enjoy a three-day weekend for the same salary.
According to the sources, the idea would "fit" into the plans and economic agenda of the party to tilt the country in favor of the workers.
This shift to a four-day week has received support from the Congress of Trade Unions, as it is a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
As a senior Labour official told The Sunday Times: A revision of the directive is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
“It will not be achieved overnight, but the four-day workweek is definitely a matter that the party hopes to incorporate to rebalance the economy in favor of the worker, as well as in the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first to back such ideas, as the Green Party has already promised a four-day workweek in its campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at the moment, not all the Labour Party supports this decision.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day work week is not part of the party’s policy and will not be discussed at this time.”
Shadow Finance Minister John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference held last week to expose his idea of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to recover powers from “anonymous directors” and “take advantage” of companies that provide public services.
The minister’s plans in the shadows also include the idea that the current shareholders of the water companies do not recover their full shareholding, since a Labour government could apply deductions that correspond to perceived irregularities.
It also confirmed its intention to include workers on company boards and create inclusive property funds where 10% of private sector companies’ shares are to be allocated to employees, resulting in annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in "60 Minutes" about the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh and whether it could make them change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote for confirmation as a Supreme Court judge for at least a week, and also raises the question of whether the findings could influence any Republican senator who ultimately decides to withdraw his support.
In an interview to be aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI could bring to light information that would make them change their minds.
Kennedy was more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course, of course," Kennedy said.
"I was in favor of proceeding with the hearing, I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after all this happened, made the allegation come out and asked him, 'Did you do it?'
He was strong, determined, determined.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems irrevocable.
“I already have a decision made around Brett Kavanaugh and I would ignore the accusation,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I do know this: Brett flatly denied it,” Graham said, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she names have been able to confirm it.
36 years ago.
It’s always the same, I don’t see anything new in this case.”
What is the Global Citizen Festival? Have you managed to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival, where an impressive star-studded poster gathers for an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
This year, in its seventh edition, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people travel to the Great Lawn in Central Park to enjoy performances by Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: ending extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international awareness group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
If you want to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you can afford a VIP ticket), concert attendees have had to complete a series of tasks or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending emails to a world leader, making a phone call, or anything else that serves to raise awareness about your goal of ending poverty.
However, what has the Global Citizen achieved after 12 years of reaching its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding with a free concert a genuine way to persuade people to take action or is it just a form of so-called “clictivism,” which is called the stance we take when we think we’re doing something really useful when signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen claims to have registered more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters in favor of a large number of diverse goals.
Thanks to these actions, they claim to have made world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which will impact the lives of more than 2250 million people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that arose from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the guaranteed funds have directly influenced nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the most important commitments is "The Power of Nutrition", an association of UK-based investors and executives united with the common commitment to "help children grow and develop to their full potential". To this end, they have proposed to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end the country's malnutrition after receiving more than 4700 Cizen Global twee
“Thanks to the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens collaborators like you, we can mark a small milestone in the history of social injustice of malnutrition,” Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition, told the crowd during a concert in April 2018 in London.
The group also said that after carrying out more than 5,000 actions to try to improve nutrition in the UK for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, Power of Nutrition, with which 5 million women and children will benefit from nutrition-related interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website about what we believe can be done to remedy extreme poverty,
A Global Citizen contributor said: “It will be a long and hard road and, in many cases, we will stumble and fall.
But, as human rights and anti-apartheid movements have achieved before, we will achieve our goals, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are some of the performances we will have at this year’s New York event, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. Could Use Navy to Carry Out Blockade on Russia's Energy Exports - Homeland Security
“If necessary,” Washington could turn to its Navy to prevent Russian energy from shaking markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s alliance with Syria, particularly where it operates at the behest of the legitimate government, is nothing more than a pretext for expansion into new markets.
“I am convinced that they are in the Middle East to negotiate with energy, just as they are in Eastern Europe, becoming the southernmost supplier in Europe,” he said.
In addition, according to official information, there are ways and methods to address this issue.
“The United States, with its Navy, has the ability to ensure that sea lanes remain open and, if necessary, could even block them to ensure that energy doesn’t end up on the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed people who attended an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that defines itself as the “voice of the energy consumer” in the United States.
In it, he compared the approaches Washington maintains in its negotiations with Russia and Iran, and warned that they are, in fact, the same.
“The economic alternative in Iran and Russia is basically to take advantage of and replace fuels,” he warned, noting that Russia only knows how to do one thing, which is to base its economy on fossil fuels.
These claims come as the Trump administration has been trying to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and relieve Russia of its role, which is the cheapest option for European consumers.
For this, members of the Trump administration, including Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to abandon the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says will turn Berlin into a hostage to Moscow.
Moscow has insisted at all times that the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which reaches a value of $11 billion and is intended to double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s fervent opposition to the project responds only to economic motives and is a further sign of unfair competition.
“I think we all share the idea that energy cannot become a pressure tool and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow last September.
The US stance has been met, however, with the rejection of Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
The leading industry organization in Germany, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has asked the US not to intervene in the EU’s energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"It's a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will look closely at the possibility of running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would consider joining the presidential race after the midterm elections.
During an appearance at Holyoke City Hall, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that this challenge was being raised.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington to amend our fractured government and finally have women among the leaders,” she said.
“After November 6, I will seriously consider the possibility of running for president.”
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during a City Hall appearance and stated that he was “leading the country down the wrong path.”
“I’m really concerned about the damage Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” he said.
Warren spoke bluntly about Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet last Friday, Warren said that "it is absolutely necessary for the FBI to investigate what happened before the vote."
A poll was published on Thursday in which, however, a majority of Warren’s own voters do not believe he should run for the 2020 election.
58% of "possible" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not appear, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
32% of respondents did, however, support their candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38% support for a possible candidacy and 48% against.
Other recognized members of the Democratic Party spoke about the possible 2020 candidacy of former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin talks about Track Palin’s post-traumatic stress disorder at a Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“The situation that my son is going through, because of everything that has happened since he came back, is well known to the other families who suffer the effects of PTSD and other injuries with which our soldiers return,” he told the audience that gathered at a rally in favor of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin referred to this arrest as the great taboo that no one wants to talk about, and commented on his son and other war veterans who "return with a different, hardened behavior, wondering if there really is that respect towards what their fellow soldiers and airmen, as well as all the other members of the army, have given their country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, on charges of domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a report of domestic violence and possession of weapons under the effects of drugs or alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla’s police department.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge to achieve a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a judicial appeal to the new U.S. policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or gang violence.
Representatives from all 18 states and the district filed a “friendly” letter Friday in Washington to show their support for an asylum seeker facing the current directive, NBC News reported.
The plaintiff’s full name has not been disclosed in the “Grace v. Sessions” case filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) against federal policy.
She said her partner "and her children, who are members of a violent gang," abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers representing these states defending Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate a large number of asylum applications to the U.S., as nations facing widespread problems related to domestic violence and gangs.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Board of Migration Appeals (BIA) that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence could apply for asylum in this country.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine made a statement on Friday in which he said the new policy "ignores decades of international, federal and state law."
“Under federal law, all asylum applications must be unsuccessful by virtue of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim and, instead, this exception violates that principle,” the amicus curiae states.
The lawyers also said in the letter that the policy denying entry to immigrants harms the U.S. economy by claiming that they tend to become entrepreneurs more often and “suppose a necessary labor force.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic abuse and gang violence in June.
“People who leave their countries of origin for reasons of persecution or threats by race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political opinion can apply for asylum,” Sessions said when announcing the directive on June 11.
Asylum was never created as a measure to alleviate all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people around the world face on a daily basis.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll rises in a race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation was increasingly dire.
“The situation is very tense,” Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told us as she tried to comfort her fevered baby at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
“Every minute, ambulances arrive with more bodies.
And clean water is scarce.”
Some residents have returned to their destroyed homes to search for the few drowned belongings left in an effort to recover what is possible.
There are hundreds of people injured and hospitals, also damaged due to the magnitude 7.5 earthquake, are overflowing.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who has his back and shoulder broken, were resting on the outside of Palu Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside the building due to the continuous, also very strong replicas.
He could not help but cry when he told us about the violent earthquake that he lived while on the 5th floor of the hotel with his wife and daughter.
“We didn’t have time to be safe.
I got caught in the wreckage of the collapsed wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press. He and his family were in town to celebrate a wedding.
“I heard my wife asking for help and then a tremendous silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they're okay."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of “bullying” with “propaganda ads”
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper promoting the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread its propaganda.
Last Wednesday, US President Donald Trump referred to China Daily’s payment supplement on the Des Moines Register, Iowa’s best-selling newspaper, after accusing China of wanting to meddle in the Nov. 6 U.S. Congressional elections, something China flatly denies.
Trump’s indictment of Beijing’s attempt to influence the U.S. election marked what U.S. officials told Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign initiated by Washington to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to issue advertisements to promote their trade activities, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has led them to increase tariff levels on imports by both sides.
China’s countervailing tariffs that applied at the start of the trade war were thought to fall on exporters from states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former governor of Iowa, which is a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed U.S. workers, farmers and entrepreneurs.
As Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register, China “is further intensifying that pressure with ad publications in our free press.”
“To try to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America’s cherished tradition of free speech and free press in attempting to publish a payment announcement in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“Instead, in the street kiosk where we are here in Beijing, you see only a few dissenting voices and no real reflection of the disparate views that people in China may have about the worrying trajectory that their country’s economy is taking, as the media is controlled by the firm pressure of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that "one of the most relevant newspapers in China evaded the offer to publish" his article, although he did not specify which newspaper it was.
Analysts point out that Republicans are distancing themselves from women before mid-term voting with Kavanaugh’s debacle
As many prominent Republicans are closing ranks in favor of Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh in the face of various allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that there may be a setback, especially on the part of women, in the upcoming mid-term votes.
The emotions surrounding this have been very intense and there are many Republicans who have said they want to move forward with the vote.
“In these kinds of issues it is not possible to back down,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the University of Syracuse’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake’s latest attempt to position himself in favor of the FBI investigation was enough to calm voters upset with the matter.
“Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday; they are not going to forget it tomorrow or in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters who gathered at the doors of the Senate chanted “November is coming!” (November is coming soon!) at the time the Republicans who controlled the Judiciary Committee decided to move forward with Kavanaugh’s candidacy, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is out of the question," Stu Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, told the news site.
“People say the impact is already very relevant and indeed it is.
But she could be even older, especially among undecided women in the suburbs and younger voters, aged 18-29, who don’t usually vote even if they don’t like the president.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing his allegations of sexual abuse against the Supreme Court candidate, analysts indicated that there could be a setback if Republicans went ahead with the confirmation.
“This issue has become a big mess for the Republican Party,” Michael Steele, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s no longer just a matter of the committee’s vote or the final vote, not even if they sit on Kavanaugh’s bench; it’s also about how Republicans have handled all of this and how they’ve treated her,” Guy Cecil, director of US Priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news channel.
However, Americans seem to be divided; they don’t know who they should believe after Ford and Kavanaugh’s testimony, although a few more are putting themselves on the side of the latter.
In a new YouGov survey, 41% of respondents say they believe Ford’s testimony definitively or likely, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh definitively or likely.
In addition, 38% said they thought Kavanaugh likely or definitively lied during his testimony, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s push, the FBI is currently investigating Ford’s statements, as well as at least those of another whistleblower, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford testified under oath before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week and said Kavanaugh raped her by being drunk at the age of 17.
For his part, Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court candidate showed him his genitals at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new company that tries to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Inrupt is the latest project in the legend of technology. A company that is based on Berners-Lee’s Solid open source platform.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which people will have access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to “dominate the world.”
“It has to be now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid technology so users can create their own “online personal data storage” or a POD.
It can contain lists, to-do lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available in a browser at the same time.
One thing that is unique about storing personal data online is that the user is the one who completely decides who can access what type of information.
The company calls it “personal training through data.”
Inrupt’s idea, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, is to incorporate the resources, processes and skills necessary for Solid to reach everyone.
At the moment, the company is made up of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform that IBM bought, some of the on-staff developers who were hired to work on the project, and a community of volunteer programmers.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world could create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not to introduce a radical change where all their business models are completely modified overnight.
"We're not going to ask permission."
In a Medium post on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote about Inrupt that “its mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web created on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has played a very influential role in the debate on net neutrality.
Despite launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: the clergyman who won a Victory Cross in World War I
The only Church of England clergyman to win a Victory Cross during World War I as a fighter has been honored in his hometown 100 years later.
Lt. Col. Bernard Vann obtained this decoration on September 29, 1918 in the attack of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, a sniper killed him four days later and never knew he had been awarded the highest British military honor.
On Saturday, her two grandchildren discovered a commemorative stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of them, Michael Vann, said it was "of a special symbolism" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the battle that earned him the honor of his grandfather.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann guided his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a thick fog and under the intense fire of machine guns and cannons".
He then ran to the line of fire and, with the "greatest courage", advanced the line before reaching a cannon with one hand and knocking down three of the detachment.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month after the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "so great that I will never be able to live up to them, but they were very sobering."
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also deposited a wreath after the parade, which featured the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that "it was a privilege for him to be part of the parade" and added that "the value of a true hero is evident when he is shown so much support."
MMA fans were up all night for the Bellator 206, but only saw Peppa Pig
Imagine you stay up all night to watch the entire Bellator 206 so you don’t get to watch the main event at the end.
The San Jose cartel had 13 fights, six included on the main card, and in the UK it was going to be broadcast live at night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, UK viewers were stunned when the show switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were not surprised after having to stay awake until early in the morning just to watch the fight.
A Twitter follower described the change to the cartoons as “a heavy joke.”
“There’s a government regulation that regulates content that’s broadcast from 6 a.m. and this wasn’t appropriate, so they had to switch to children’s programming,” Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, said when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa la cerdita," yes.
Bellator chairman Scott Coker said they will modify the program to include British viewers in the upcoming editions.
“When I think about the option of rebroadcasting, I think it can work,” Coker said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on Sunday, so we couldn’t do it until Sunday at our time, which would already be Monday for them.
We're looking at how to do it.
Believe me, when the programming was changed, a lot of messages were received and not all were kind, precisely.
We tried to fix it, because at first we thought it was a technical problem.
But that was not the case, it was a government problem.
I can promise that next time it won't happen.
We’ll reduce it to five fights instead of six, which are the ones we normally have done. We tried to offer more than usual so that the fans were happy and we had a good time.
It’s a very unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior for his sexuality
Olympic jumper Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to the rest because of his sexuality, although this was, in turn, what motivated him to become a winner.
At the age of 24, he told us that he didn’t realize until he reached high school that “not everyone was like me.”
On Radio 4’s first Desert Island Discs program, presented by Lauren Laverne, he said his intention in talking about gay rights was to convey “hope” to other people.
He also told us that becoming a father made him less important to winning the Olympics.
The regular host of this legendary show, Kirsty Young, will be absent for a few months due to illness.
In Laverne's first show, Daley, who showed himself as a marginalized, commented that he felt "lower" than the rest during his childhood, because "it was not socially accepted that you liked boys and girls."
He said: “To this day, that feeling of inferiority and being different has really given me the power and strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint when he finally discovered his sexuality.
The winner of two bronze medals at the Olympics has become a prominent profile of the LGBT movement and his image has been used at this year’s Commonwealth Games held in Australia to demand that more countries decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he told it because he felt lucky to live in freedom, without reprisals, and wanted to pass that “hope” on to other people.
The three-time world champion declared that it was also a surprise for him to fall in love with a man, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, though he specified that the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you've lived so long since you were so young" (it was his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later), it's hard to find someone the same age who's gone through the same highs and lows as you.
The couple had a son in June whom they named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said their "global outlook" had changed.
"If they had asked me last year, all the answers would have revolved around 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he said.
“But you know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is, without a doubt, Robbie.”
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept that he was going to die and, in fact, one of the last things he asked is if they had the London 2012 passes, because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I wasn't able to tell him I wasn't going to be able to be in the front row," he said.
"He had his hand between mine when he stopped breathing and it wasn't until that precise moment when he stopped breathing and died that I realized he wasn't invincible," he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
“At the time I knew that that was what I had dreamed of all my life: competing in the pool in front of mine at an Olympic Games, there was nothing better,” he said.
This fact was also the one that inspired him when choosing his first song, Proud by Heather Small, which accompanied him in the preparation phase of the Olympic Games.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, in low form, stayed on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but will have to reverse his form if he wants to keep it from becoming a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who played at the event held every two years to set a record for the 12th time, was knocked out by Captain Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as he has so often done for the United States, the five-time champion of major tournaments had to settle for cheering in a few moments and, in others, try to perfect his game on the field and thus be able to rectify what afflicts him.
Never the most direct of drivers, not even at the highest point of his career, the 48-year-old is not at his best for the Le Golf National course, where the long rough continually punishes with mishits.
And, if the field is no longer discouraging enough, Mickelson, in Sunday’s ninth game, faces brilliant British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has joined debutant Tommy Fleetwood to win all four games they’ve played this week.
If the Americans, who were four points below at the start of the 12 individual games, started impressively, Mickelson’s game could have been decisive.
Furyk showed confidence in his partner, he couldn’t say much more either.
“He perfectly understood the role I had today, he gave me a pat on the back and, surrounding me with his arm, he said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He is in the Hall of Fame and has contributed a lot to these teams before and this week.
I probably didn’t know that by playing two games.
I thought they would be more, but that’s how it came out and that’s how we thought it had to be.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo’s mark of most Ryder Cup games played.
It could be the latest in a Ryder Cups career that has never so clearly matched the levels of its individual brand.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, although Furyk said his presence brought many more intangible values to the team.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, witty, he likes to make fun of others; it’s great to have him on the team,” he explained.
"I think the younger players have loved to have it as support, also this week; it was fun.
It’s much more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that leadership can disappear very soon
Thomas Bjorn, the captain of Europe, knows very well that, although you enter with a substantial advantage in the last days of the Ryder Cup, it can easily become an uncomfortable tournament.
The Dane made his debut in the 1997 game at Valderrama, where a side captained by Seve Ballesteros maintained a five-point lead over the Americans, but in the end they only managed to finish off the others by kicking their heels by a minimal margin, winning 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You don’t stop remembering that we did a great tournament at Valderrama; we did it at Brookline and we lost, we did it at Valderrama and we won, but for very little,” said Bjorn, portrayed, after seeing the 2018 generation win 5-3 on Friday and leading it yesterday with a 10-6 at Le Golf National.
History will teach me and everyone else that this team is not finished.
You have to give it all tomorrow.
Get out there and do what you have to do.
This doesn’t end until the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal to fulfill, which is to win this trophy, and that’s all we have to think about.
I say it all the time, I focus on the 12 players on our team, but we are very aware of what is on the other side where they are, neither more nor less, than the best players in the world.
Proud of what his players have done on a very tough golf course, Bjorn added: “I don’t want to get ahead of myself.
Tomorrow is a different challenge.
What prevails tomorrow are the individual performances and this is different.
It’s great to share what’s going on with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you put all your golfing skills to the test.
That’s the message you have to convey to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now it’s time to put your partner aside, go and get the best out of yourself.”
In front of Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will try to get his players to do better individually than they did as a couple, with the exceptions being Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who added three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been on both ends in the final days of those big tournaments and has been part of the team that won at Brookline and then ended up losing when Europe held the "Miracle of Medinah".
“I remember every word,” he told us when we asked him how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, managed to motivate his players on the last day.
“We have 12 super important games tomorrow, but we have to start as well as we did at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
When we all move in one direction, all the pressure falls on those intermediate parties.
We defined our strategy and made them come out with the feeling that we were going to try to do something magical tomorrow.”
Thomas is assigned the task of trying to lead the fight and face Rory McIlroy in the main game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the second half of the list.
“I was with this group of guys in this order because I think they cover the whole tour,” Bjorn said of his individual selections.
The new German warship, postponed again
The new German Navy frigate should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era ships, but it will not be made until at least next year due to faulty systems and the progressive increase in costs, local media reported.
The delivery of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the ship that heads the new Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019, according to statements by a military spokesman.
The ship should have joined the Navy in 2014, but the problems that arose after delivery bothered the completion of the ambitious project.
The four ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class that the Navy requested in 2007 will replace the old Bremen-class frigates.
We know that they will include a powerful cannon, a set of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some invisibility technologies, such as radar signals, infrared and very low acoustics.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods, so that they can be deployed for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continuing delays have caused the innovative ships (which were supposed to allow Germany to project its power overseas) to be out of date when they begin to serve, Die Zeit notes.
The unfortunate F125 frigate occupied headlines last year, when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into operation and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the return, but the German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware defects" that left the ship virtually useless if sent on a combat mission.
The software deficiencies were particularly important, as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors: half the staff that was in the former Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the ship is overweight, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice as heavy as other ships of a similar class used by the Germans in World War II.
In addition to faulty hardware, the price of the entire project, including crew training, has also posed a problem.
It is believed to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31 billion ($36 billion), rather than the initial <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>22 billion.
The problems attributed to the new frigates are of particular relevance in the light of recent warnings about the reduction of Germany's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged that the Navy is “remaining without ships capable of deploying.”
The officer said the problem has been getting worse over time, because old ships were laid off, but have not been replaced with others.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust spies on the secret life of bats
This new research, which has been carried out in a state in the Scottish Highlands, attempts to discover how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
Everything that is discovered is expected to shed more light on the behavior of the only flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, conducted by the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common bats and sopranos, as well as the riverside bats of Daubenton and long-eared browns of the Inverewe gardens at Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at strategic locations on the property to track bat activities during the season.
The NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile research with portable detectors.
Experts will analyze the sounds that are collected in the recordings to discover the frequency of bat calls and what species do they do.
A report and a habitat map will then be produced to create a detailed picture of the environment and its behavior.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for NTS, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to bats and how each species uses them.
This information will determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as grassland creation and how forests should be maintained for bats and other associated species.
The populations of bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom have declined considerably in the last century.
They are under threat from the construction and development that affects their nests and the loss of their habitat.
Wind turbines and electrical wiring can also pose a risk to them, as can insecticidal papers and other chemical treatments of building materials or domestic cat attacks.
The bats are not really blind,
but, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes to achieve their goal.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique that locates ants and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has ten experts trained in the field, who regularly conduct surveys, nest inspections and, on occasion, rescues.
The organisation has even inaugurated Scotland’s first and only bat reserve in the state of Threeave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland’s ten bat species.
The property’s director, David Thompson, says it’s the ideal territory for them.
“Here at Threave, we have a fantastic bat area,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the right habitat.
However, there are still a lot of unknowns about bats, so the work we do here and on other properties will help us better understand what they need to develop.”
It stresses the importance of checking if there are bats before carrying out maintenance tasks within the properties, since a breeding colony can be involuntarily destroyed and 400 females and young could be killed, which would mean annihilating an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or molest them, as well as destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish officer in charge of the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to collaborate.
He said: “We still have a lot to learn about bats and many other species that we don’t know how their populations evolve.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations at the same time as his lawyers pursue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has categorised rape allegations as “fake news,” and says people “want to make themselves known” at the expense of his name.
His lawyers have been instructed to report to the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which was where the statements were published.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker is accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is accused of paying $375,000 to cover up the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
With an Instagram Live video that has already amassed 142 million followers hours after the news was published, Ronaldo, 33, branded the report as “fake news.”
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they have said today is false," says the five-time Ballon d'Or winner looking at the camera.
“They just want advertising at the expense of my name.
It's the same old story.
They want to become famous just by mentioning me, but that’s the way it is, I can’t help it.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added, smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against Der Spiegel over the allegations that appear in what they have called "an inadmissible report of suspicions in the field of privacy," Reuters reports.
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player will seek compensation for “moral damages for an amount that corresponds to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of his personal rights in recent years.”
Apparently, the alleged incident took place in June 2009 at a Palms Hotel and Casino suite in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player’s room and there he allegedly raped her anally, according to documents filed with Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga stated that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told him that he was a “99 percent” a “good guy” and that he had let that “one percent” down.
The documents state that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that he was consented.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and that they took photographs of the injuries at the hospital, but later agreed to reach an extrajudicial settlement because she had "terror to the reprisals" and was concerned about "being humiliated in public."
The 34-year-old woman says she is trying to nullify the agreement, as she remains traumatized by the events.
When the alleged aggression occurred, Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer has switched to Juve, a major of Italian football for a contract of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK would always regret losing automakers
The UK “would regret it for a lifetime” if it lost its position as a world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, Industry Secretary Greg Clark said.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK would tell the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, production would temporarily stop at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Mr. Clark said.
The Japanese manufacturer said the impact of delays on customs in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The Burnaston plant, which makes Toyota’s Auris and Avensis models, produced some 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“My opinion is that if Britain breaks with the EU at the end of March, there will be production stops at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have raised concerns about leaving the EU without a deal, especially in relation to cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concerns that car manufacturers are concerned with revolve around the problems that could arise in the assembly lines in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is based on the “just in time” production mode, where parts arrive every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers to make custom cars.
If the UK leaves the European Union without a deal on 29 March, there could be a disruption at the border that, according to the sector, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to house the amount of material equivalent to more than a day’s inventory at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and in that case production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s Chequers plan, which establishes future relations with the EU, is “calibrated precisely to avoid those checks at border crossings.”
"We want to have the best deal that not only allows us to get out of the way right now but we have to seize the opportunity," he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
“The evidence from Toyota, among many other manufacturers, is that we need to be able to continue what, so far, has been a tremendously successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say for how long production would stop, but warned that, in the long run, the added costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and ultimately costs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is in charge of the Unite union at the plant, said its members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, once those jobs are lost, they never recover.”
A government spokesman said: “We have put in place a precise and convincing plan to delineate our future relations with the EU.”
Trump’s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s high-risk meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “postponed another week” as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating interference in the Russian election, links between Trump’s aid and Russia, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The expectation of whether Trump decides to fire the deputy attorney general or not and thereby compromise Mueller’s independence has fueled Washington’s scuffles for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein recorded the conversations he held with Trump with a microphone he himself wore to try to relegate the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied it was true.
However, he went to the White House on Monday, amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump (who was at the United Nations in New York at the time) was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein but the meeting had to be postponed to avoid a conflict with the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump asked the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh for a week, although this would delay the Senate plenary vote.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein’s meeting, he said: “No date has been set, it could be this week or it could be postponed another, considering everything that is happening with the Supreme Court.
We will decide on the march and I will inform the press, as I usually do.”
Some journalists would refute that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The presenter Chris Wallace asked what the motives were.
Sanders said the shortage of press wheels was not due to an aversion to big-time TV journalists, though he said, "I didn't disagree with the fact that they fantasize."
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president conducts more question-and-answer sessions than any other president before him,” he said, citing no evidence: “We’ve contrasted those numbers.”
The press conferences will continue to be held, Sanders said, but “if the press has the option to ask the president of the United States directly, I think it’s much better than making them to me.
We’ve tried to do it many times and you’ve seen us do it many times in the last few weeks, so this would replace a press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States.”
Trump usually answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public meetings or press conferences with dignitaries who visit him.
Press conferences with him only occur on very rare occasions.
In fact, this week in New York, the president demonstrated why he was so, where he made a casual and sometimes bizarre appearance to the journalists who were gathered there.
Secretary of State for Health writes to NHS Scotland EU workers about their fears of Brexit
The Secretary of State for Health has written to the EU staff working at Scotland’s HHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire for them to continue with them after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter just six months before the UK pulled out of the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to covering the cost of citizenship applications for EU members working in public services that do not depend on the central government.
In her letter, Ms. Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union on the departure in which it was chosen to make the decisions expected this fall have continued.
However, the UK government has also stepped up preparations around a possible scenario in which there would be no agreement.
I know all this must be very disconcerting for you.
And it is for this reason that I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each of the staff members, regardless of their nationality.
Professionals from all over the EU and other countries bring valuable experience and many skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service, from which patients and the communities we serve benefit.
Scotland is, without a doubt, your home and we would love to continue to count on you.”
Christion Abercrombie is undergoing emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers player Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury last Saturday when they lost 31-27 to Vanderbilt Commodores, Tennessee’s Mike Organ reported.
Tennessee State coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before the break.
"He came to the band and collapsed right there," Reed said.
Both coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the band line before placing him on a stretcher and leading him to a thorough examination.
A Tennessee State staff member told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had left the operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "there were no details about the type of injury yet or the damage caused" and the Tennessee State is trying to find out when it happened.
Abercrombie, redshirt sophomore, is playing in his first season with Tennessee State after being transferred from Illinois.
He made five tackles on Saturday before leaving the field, with which he added a total of 18 throughout the season.
Foreigners will be subject to a higher estate transfer tax when buying a property in the UK
Foreigners will be subject to a higher property transfer tax when they buy a property in the UK and the extra money raised with this measure will be used to give shelter to the “unroofed,” according to the Conservatives’ new plans.
The change will neutralize the success of Corbyn’s offensive to attract younger voters
The increase in the transfer tax on farms will be imposed on those who are not paying taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year that will go to the "roofless"
The additional money raised with the increase in property transfer tax to foreign buyers of property in the UK will go towards aid to the “unroofed,” Theresa May announced today.
The move is understood as an attempt to neutralize the success Jeremy Corbyn is reaping with his pledges to provide more affordable housing to attract younger and harassing voters who have higher incomes.
The increase in property transfer tax will be taxed on people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK and that money will be used to incentivize government policy to combat the problem of begging on the streets.
The surcharge, which is a supplement to the current transmission tax, including also the increase in levels that was introduced two years ago on second-hand housing and the "buy-to-let" system, could reach up to 3%.
The Treasury expects to raise up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year with this change.
It is estimated that 13% of London’s newly built properties are bought by people who do not reside in the UK, leading to higher prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to access affordable housing.
Many of the country’s wealthiest areas (especially in the capital) have become “ghost cities” due to the large number of foreign buyers spending most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the transmission tax in order to help young people buy their first home.
He accused the big housebuilders of keeping very high prices on the property by avidly buying land without intent to use it and urged Mrs. May to eliminate the quotas that apply to affordable housing to solve the "shameful housing problem" in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has announced a number of very attractive housing reforms, including rent controls and the end of evictions for no reason.
It also proposes to give local authorities more powers to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said I would dedicate my post as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream of improving the lives of every new generation.
And that means solving the housing market, which is so devastated.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it cannot be that people who do not live in the UK, as well as foreign companies, can buy housing more easily than the British working class.
“The dream of having a house has become too hard for many people to achieve and the humiliation of having to sleep on the street is still too real.”
Jack Ross: "My primary goal is to lead Scotland"
The Sunderland coach says his "primordial goal" is to become Scotland's coach at some point.
The 42-year-old is excited about the possibility of revitalizing the Northeast club, which currently holds the third place in League One (England's third league division), three points from the first.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country when I was a player.
But I only got a B cap," Ross told Sportsound on BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up seeing Scotland in Hampden with my father as a kid and it’s something he’s always done that he wanted to come back.
That opportunity will only become a reality, however, if I manage to run a club successfully.”
Ross' predecessors as leader of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he did not feel any fear when he moved on to such established names at such a large club, after rejecting proposals from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, success for me is measured based on whether I can return this club to the Premier League.
“The structure and facilities of this club certainly correspond to those of the Premier League,” he said.
“It’s not easy to achieve that, but I could only consider that I have achieved my goal here when I can bring the club back to where it should be.”
Ross has only been coaching for three years, having spent time as an assistant at Dumbarton and a 15-month stint on the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa recover from the descent to the third division and made the St. Mirren move from being on the edge of the descent to winning the championship the following season.
In fact, Ross claims he feels more comfortable now than ever before during his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real crossroads,” he recalled in reference to when he took over the Alloa.
“I always thought that management was the best thing for me, much more than just playing.
It may sound weird, because it was good, I was able to make a living from it and I enjoyed some epic moments.
But playing can be very hard.
You have to deal with a lot of things every week.
I still suffer from the stress and pressure of that job; however, in the direction I feel good.
I always wanted to train and now I have managed to do it, it is the time of my adult life in which I have felt better, without a doubt.

According to a survey, the perfect time for a pint is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday.
The summer heat wave has boosted profits in British pubs struggling to survive, but it has focused all the pressure on restaurant chains.
Pub and bar groups saw their sales increase by 2.7% in July, while restaurant profits fell by 4.8%, the figures revealed.
Peter Martin, of the CGA business consultancy, which was in charge of collecting the figures, commented: “The heat these days and the fact that England is still in the World Cup have still kept the pattern of the previous month of June in July, in which pubs increased their profits by 2.8%, although restaurants have fallen even slightly more.
The 1.8% drop in restaurant business activity in June was even worse in July.
Pubs and bars that serve mainly drinks had their strongest month, compared to most restaurants, where they reduced profits.
Pubs serving mainly meals also suffered from the heat, though not as drastically as restaurant operators.
It seems people just want to go out for a drink.
In managed bars and pubs, beverage sales rose as much as 6.6% during the month, while meals fell by 3%.
Paul Newman, of RSM’s hospitality and leisure analysts, said: “These results follow the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
Time and the impact of very important social or sporting events remain the most relevant factors when it comes to sales in the out-of-home activity market.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, although the 4.8% drop in sales compared to last year will be especially painful in view of ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer couldn’t have come at a worse time for food service operators and the weather will tell if the milder temperatures we’ve had in August will provide the relief they need.
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new ones that have opened, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slow decline in brand deployments.
Coffer Peach Tracker, which oversees sales in the UK restaurant, bar and pub sector, collects and analyzes the performance data of 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion and is the market benchmark.
One in five children have secret social media accounts behind their parents.
One in five children (some as young as 11) have secret social media accounts behind their parents and teachers, a survey reveals.
The survey, conducted on 20,000 high school students, revealed a growth in fake Instagram pages
The news has exacerbated fears that sexual content will be published
20% of students claimed to have a "principal" account showing their parents
One in five children (some as young as 11) create social media accounts that hide adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed the rapid growth that has been experienced on fake Instagram accounts, a reference site for sharing photos.
The news has exacerbated fears that sexual content will be published.
20% of students said they had a healthy "main" account that they showed to their parents, while they had other private ones.
A mother who happened to come across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret site saw a teenager encourage others to “rape me.”
The research, conducted by the Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40% of children between the ages of 11 and 18 had two profiles, and half of them admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, said: “It’s alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create spaces on the Internet where their parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" in the Scottish Athletics Federation's directive
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to be part of the Scottish Athletics Federation's board of directors as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland’s most awarded track and field athlete and its president, Ian Beattie, described the change as a great opportunity for those who claim the sport benefits from his vast international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh is recognised and respected throughout the athletics community in Scotland, the UK and the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will greatly benefit from having her on board," Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I like being the spokesperson for the athletes and I hope I can contribute things and help develop the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta among the four golds he won and is now a regular expert on the BBC, suffered a transient ischemic attack that left him unable to walk.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
According to the doctors, only time would determine whether or to what extent I would recover.
It’s been exhausting, but I managed to fully recover, I had to learn to walk again and I’m currently doing agility exercises.
Thank you for the messages and words of encouragement!"
The announcement of the sacaleches where compared to mothers with cows divides the opinion on the Internet
A dairy company has divided public opinion on the Internet with an ad comparing mothers who breastfeed with cows they milk.
To mark the launch of what is theoretically the “world’s first silent milkshake,” consumer technology company Elvie posted an ad inspired by a somewhat ironic music video showing mothers telling them the freedom the new milkshake gives them.
Four royal women dance in a hay-filled barn as a dance floor, along with some cows, with lyrics such as "Yes, I milk myself, but I have no tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're my breasts."
The chorus goes on to say, "Order them, order them, I'm feeding their babies, order them, order them, I'm ordering my women."
However, the announcement, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, has created a lot of controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received reactions from all kinds of people who have seen it, where many say it manages to focus on the "horror" of the dairy sector.
"A very unfortunate decision to put cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they have to get pregnant before they give birth to be able to produce milk, with the exception that they are taken away from their babies days after giving birth,” one person wrote.
The Elvie milk extractor fits discreetly in a nursing bra (Elvie/Mother).
Another person commented: "Trauma for the mother and for the baby.
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a milk extractor for mothers who do stay with their babies?”
Another comment was, "What a messed-up announcement."
However, other people defended the ad, such as a woman who admitted that the song was "disgusting".
“I think it’s a great idea.
If I still had to breastfeed, I'm sure I'd have one.
When I used the bomb, I felt totally like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I don't give a shit about it anymore.
It’s a product genius,” one woman told us.
Another person commented: “It’s a funny ad aimed at mothers who use a lactation pump (sometimes in the workplace or in public toilets), which makes them feel like cows.
The announcement neither praises nor judges the dairy sector.”
At the end of the video, the group of women show that they have been dancing with the discreet bombs placed inside the bras.
The campaign’s concept is based on the perception that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie Pump is totally silent, has no cables or tubes, and discreetly engages within the nursing bra, making its users able to move, hold their babies and even go out on the street with the pump running.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, comments: “The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By showing the parallels between expressive women and dairy cows, we wanted to draw attention to the use of lactation pumps and their challenges, while demonstrating in an entertaining and close-up way the incredible sense of freedom offered by the new pump.
This is not the first time the Elvie bomb has appeared in headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two paraded through the catwalk for designer Marta Jakubowski while using the product.
Hundreds of Minor Immigrants Discretely Displaced to a Camp on Texas Border
The number of underage immigrants detained has increased considerably, despite the fact that the monthly influx at the border has practically remained at the usual levels. In part, this is because the harsh rhetoric and policies introduced by the Trump administration are complicating the possibility of sponsoring these children.
Traditionally, most godparents, who were also undocumented immigrants at the time, feared that proposing to host a child would jeopardize their own stay in the country.
This risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential godparents and other adult members of their families should present their fingerprints and that the data would be shared with government immigration entities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who asked to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal record.
“About 80% of the sponsors or their relatives are in the country illegally, and a large part of them are criminal immigrants.
Therefore, we continue to persecute these people,” Albence said.
In their effort to prosecute minors more quickly, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a maximum of one month of detention, rather than 60 days, which was the previous rule, according to workers at the shelters.
Many of them will testify by video conference, rather than in person, to defend their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered fit for shelter will be deported as soon as possible.
According to shelter workers and system reports that have emerged in recent months, the longer they remain in custody, the greater the likelihood that they will suffer anxiety or depression, which could lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
According to the defenders, these concerns increase even more in larger facilities, such as that of Tornillo, where, due to their size, signs of discomfort in these children are more likely to be overlooked.
In addition, moving to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare them emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends could cause them a trauma that many are already suffering.
Syria calls on U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return to their homes, despite the country’s war being in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian territory under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that the issue "will be dealt with accordingly."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have been uprooted from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight in this sacred battle until we purge all Syrian territories" from both terrorist groups and "any illegal foreign presence."
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly providing training and advice to Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said the right conditions were in place for them to return and blamed “some Western countries” for “sowing irrational fears” that made refugees decide to stay out of the country.
“We have asked the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian problem.”
The United States and the European Union have already warned that they will not help rebuild Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a containment zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to force political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a large-scale assault by Syrian and Russian forces in the province, where three million people live.
However, Moualem has made it clear that the deal had “clear deadlines” and has expressed hope that military action will focus on jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front (linked to al-Qaeda), who “will be eradicated.”
Staffan de Mistura, a UN special envoy, hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of members of the government and the opposition to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, arguing that the panel's work should be restricted to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and warned against any interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
Under that logic, Trump would win re-election in 2020, unless, as many liberal viewers will surely expect, a ouster or scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of a presidency ever seen!”
At the moment there are no signs of fatigue in the spectators.
Since 2014, the highest-audience hour ratings have doubled to 1.05 million for CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers per hour of peak audience, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has surpassed cable channel ratings by 3.5 million viewers for major night news programs.
“It’s a strange attraction that we haven’t figured out yet,” says Neal Baer, author-producer of “Designated Survivor,” an ABC drama about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
Remember a taxi ride you did in Boston before the 2016 election.
The taxi driver told him he would vote for Trump.
Why? he asked.
"Because it makes me laugh," was Scovell's response.
Chaos is always on the rise in the world of entertainment.
Obviously, and unlike anything else seen on television, the arguments coming out of Washington could determine the future of the Roe v. Wade case, the possibility that immigrant families might come together, or the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
However, the information exceeds the limits when you realize that you’ve been watching an expert panel for six hours discussing the use of the “deep background” sources that Bob Woodward used for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 ostrich-leather hunter (“a garment of excessive pride,” in the words of The Washington Post’s The Washington Post’s “Escarpants”).
As far as I’m concerned, I’ll never see Super Mario the same way again.
“By offering something new every night, it’s in part what makes it look like a reality show,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” when he talks about the Trump show’s alternating cast and its daily plot twists (whether it’s getting into an NFL fight or praising Kim Jong-un).
You can’t afford to miss an episode if you don’t want to be left behind.
When I went to speak this week with Mr. Fleiss, it was a sunny 27-degree day on the north coast of Kauai, but he was a refugee inside the house watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn’t get off the TV, not with Brett Kavanaugh ready to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and with the future of the Supreme Court hanging by a thread.
“I remember when in those days we were doing all that program madness and people were telling us that that was the beginning of the end of Western civilization,” Fleiss tells me.
"I thought it was all a joke, but in the end it turned out they were right."

Foreign money flows into the tightest midterm elections in the House of Representatives
Not surprisingly, the influx of money is reaching Pennsylvania’s 17th district, thanks to the restructuring of a congressional district with two candidates seeking re-election to the same seat.
This recently redesigned Pittsburg residential district has Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another candidate for re-election, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's former 12th district, a district that largely overlaps with the new 17.
The maps were redesigned after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that former districts had been unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of Republicans.
The race for the new 17 has sparked a funding battle for the campaigns between the parties’ main financial arm, the National Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb’s name became very familiar in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election held in March for Pennsylvania’s 18th Congressional District.
That seat had been occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support of China, although after throwing back
The diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with a slight rejection by Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and occupied a hotel in Panama until partners evicted the Trump Organization administration team.
State Department officials have decided to return the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama due to “recent decisions to stop recognizing Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, the department’s spokeswoman, said in a statement this month.
But it was only decided to sanction El Salvador, which had already received aid of around US$140 million in 2017 for, among other things, drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed sanctions, which included cuts to financial aid and restrictions on certain visas, would have been very painful for the Central American country and its high rates of unemployment and crime.
As internal meetings progressed, U.S. and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity as a follow-up to a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent emigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that their intention was for the conference to go ahead, putting an end to any consideration of sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October and which, diplomats say, is seen as a sign of the importance the administration has given to the meeting.
The three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without further threats or punishment from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton’s White House declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to deal with the internal deliberations on condition of anonymity.
His explanations were corroborated by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The Study of History
The next planned step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, of which there is already considerable evidence in the public record.
Mueller is also thought to be investigating the possibility that Trump’s campaign would work in parallel with Russia in its attack on our election.
If Congress changes hands, Trump will be held accountable to that chamber, just as he prepares to present himself again to voters, and perhaps finally to a jury of his peers.
This is a lot of conditionals, and by that I am not suggesting that Trump’s downfall is inevitable, nor that of his equivalents in Europe.
We will all have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic that will have an effect on the duration of the fight.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup d'état against Hitler; all that was needed was for the West to resist him and support the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these turning points, and the inexorable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are now facing several of these turning points.
What will we do if Trump sacks Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been on a roll since this newspaper reported that last year he had suggested secretly recording the president and had speculated about his incapacity for office.
Rosenstein says The Times’ explanation is not accurate.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s new investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair, or if his position on the Supreme Court is confirmed despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
In addition to all this, will we vote in the midterm elections a Congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these exams, we will find ourselves with a long winter for democracy.
But, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague, I think we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my ambassador’s house.
He managed to survive, emigrated to the United States and, 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the same table adorned with a swastika.
With that legacy, how am I not going to be optimistic about our future?"

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, optimistic about the match against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play Thursday at home against Rapid Vienna, knowing that a win over the Austrians, after the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
“We managed to get a good point, as Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We started the game thinking we could get something and we came out with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall, the draw was maybe a fair result.
They were better in the first half, but after the break we went out for all and we were the best team.
This Thursday we will have another great European night.
I hope that we can achieve all three points, but it will be a difficult match because they already got a good result in the previous match. But, with all the public supporting us, I am sure that we will be able to move forward and get a positive result.
Last year was definitely tough with my injuries and the changes at the club itself, but now you notice a general atmosphere that everything will be fine.
The team is doing well, the guys are enjoying themselves very much and we are having a good training.
I hope we can move forward, leave last season behind and achieve success.”
The fear of retirement savings is making some women lose sleep
Despite the fact that survey participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be treated, few people talk about this with their family members.
About half of the people who participated in the Nationwide study said they did talk to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they were talking to their children about it.
“People want a relative to take care of them, but they’re not taking the steps to have this conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance company Nationwide.
This is the way to begin.
Talk to your spouse and children: you won’t be able to prepare your family to care for you if you don’t express your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to talk about where and how to receive care, as those options can be a cost determining factor.
Incorporate in the conversion to your financial advisor, as it can also help you find a way to pay those expenses.
Your long-term care financing options may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a cash-valued hybrid life insurance policy to help you cover expenses or insure yourself with your own savings, as long as you have the money.
Negotiate your legal documents: Stick to legal battles.
Take care of getting a health care power to appoint a trusted person to oversee your health care and make sure that professionals fulfill their own wishes in case they can’t communicate.
You can also prepare a notarial power for your finances.
Select a trusted person to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid if you become incapacitated.
Don’t forget the little details: imagine that your elderly father has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
Describe all these details in a written plan so that it is always ready.
“It’s not just the finances that are at stake: what doctors do you have to deal with?” asks Martin.
"What medications are you taking?
Who will take care of the dog?
Everything has to be planned.”
Several times a man is shot with a rifle in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with a rifle while walking home after going out at night.
The victim, a man in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Police officers described the shooting, which occurred around 02:30 (UK time), as a "random act".
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not fatal and the police have made an appeal to possible witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, adding that the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications blocked, aid officials have been unable to obtain any information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here you can see some important details about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 inhabitants in 2017.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a regency that extends along more than 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, which is a hierarchically inferior administrative region to the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 people in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the province, but are concentrated mainly in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck west of Donggala in 1996, with nine fatalities.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Fire Belt, an area of great seismic activity, and often suffers from earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province, in northern Sumatra, triggered a tsunami on December 26 that affected 14 countries and claimed the lives of 226,000 people on the coast of the Indian Ocean. More than half of the casualties occurred in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
There were hundreds of fatalities on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that hit the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh, causing destruction and panic by remembering the devastation of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time it did not cause any tsunami, but the collapse of buildings caused the deaths of more than 100 people.
2018: The tourist island of Lombok (Indonesia) had a series of large-scale earthquakes that killed more than 500 people, most of them on the north side of the island.
The earthquake devastated thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily evicted.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
Palin, 29, a citizen of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interfering with a report of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to the report released Saturday by Alaska State Police.
According to the police report, when a friend of his tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, he removed his phone.
Palin has been sentenced to pretrial detention at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where he was declared "definitely innocent" when asked for his statement, the chain said.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, meaning he could spend up to a year in prison and receive a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B misdemeanor, with a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with the reporting of a domestic violence crime and possession of a weapon in a state of intoxication, in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had said she punched him in the face.
Several groups of veterans criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son’s violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder derived from her service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks have fallen and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred right next to the center of Sulawesi, which is northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
There are several videos circulating on social media that show the moment of impact.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors exceptionally seek death penalty for suspected terrorist attack in New York
New York federal prosecutors are seeking capital punishment for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack that killed eight people, an exceptional punishment that has not been executed in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rental van to carry out an attack last October on a bike lane on the West Side highway in Lower Manhattan, knocking down pedestrians and cyclists he found on his way.
To justify a death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and caused "intentionally" serious bodily injuries, according to the notice of intent to apply for the death penalty, filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges carry a possible death penalty, according to the court document.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury presented Saipov with a 22-count indictment that included eight counts of murder with the aid of organized crime, which federal prosecutors usually use in these cases, and a charge of violence and destruction of motorized vehicles.
The attack required “substantial planning and premeditation,” according to prosecutors, who described Saipov’s conduct as “atrocious, cruel and depraved.”
"Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", specified in the notice.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since the last time the Southern District of New York prosecuted a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug traffickers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death penalty was executed in a New York federal case was Julius and Ethel Rosenberg in 1953. This marriage was executed after they were convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The two Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, an immigrant from Uzbekistan, demonstrated his lack of remorse during the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that for his attack he was inspired by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also requested that the ISIS flag be raised in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to the charge of 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defender lawyers representing Saipov, said they are "obviously disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
“We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence conviction with no possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for all people involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked prosecutors not to ask for the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the popular army" today during a protest at the Tory conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had to "feel the heat" from Eurosceptics, while one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should handle negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the Birmingham rally that the UK “would have already left” if Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But Prime Minister May’s challenge to reconcile her divided ranks has been further highlighted when a group of pro-stay Tories have joined an opposing protest against Brexit in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep the plan of engagement that was signed at Chequers in the midst of attacks by pro-Brexit, her opponents and the EU.
The allies insisted that they will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels, despite the violent reaction, and will force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to choose between their package and the "chaos".
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to reject the Chequers plan.
He suggested that Farage should have been given a position of responsibility in the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had been in charge, we would have already left,” he said.
This Member of Parliament for Wellingborough added: “I’m going to defend Brexit, but we have to get rid of Chequers.”
In his statement of opposition to the EU, he said: “We have not fought in world wars to be servile.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that the British have changed their minds and we want to stay in the European Union is completely false.”
Tory pro-Brexit Andrea Jenkyns was also at the rally, where she told reporters: “I’m just saying one thing: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The general public doesn’t like Chequers’ plan, the opposition isn’t going to vote for it and it’s not popular with our party and our activists, who are actually the ones who take to the streets and vote for us in the first place.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.”
In a message to May, he added: “Prime Ministers keep their positions when they deliver on their promises.”
Farage told the concentrates that politicians would have to “feel the heat” if they saw that they were going to betray the decision made in the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit and today we’re here to tell them we won’t let them get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want you to make our political class, which is about to betray Brexit, feel the heat.
“We will mobilize the popular army of this country that gave us the victory with Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, autonomous and proud UK.”
Meanwhile, the pro-stayers circled the streets of Birmingham before the two-hour rally in the city centre.
Some activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after the group’s presentation this weekend.
Labour’s Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with a party application during the opening of the conference.
“These are the same people who tell us that they can implement computer systems and all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for borders in harmony, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's a total farce.
There is nothing that can be considered a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren considers all possibilities to run for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider all possibilities of running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about her future during a municipal meeting held Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, will run for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl, the Republican state representative, who was co-chair of Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
There has been considerable speculation about the possibility that Warren will face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was his thirty-sixth meeting with voters using the municipal format since Trump took office.
An assistant asked him if he intended to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that the time has come for “women to go to Washington to fix our irregular government, and that includes having a woman at the top.”
Man Arrested for LSU Sims Player's Gun Murder
Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested for the shooting death of Wayde Sims, the LSU basketball player, last Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at a press conference at 11 a.m.
They had posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near the Southern University campus in the early hours of Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head that ultimately caused her death,” Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media on Saturday, for 247sports.
Wayde went to defend a friend and received a shot from Simpson.
During the interrogation, Simpson admitted to having been at the scene of the crime, possessing a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and detained in the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 7-foot-tall Baton Rouge native, played in 32 games last season, starting in 10 of them, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes team orders would play an important role in the race.
From the pole, Bottas had a good start and almost threw Hamilton into oblivion by defending his position in the first two laps and inviting Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel was the first to enter the pits and let Hamilton run in the group's tail, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes came out strong one lap later and got behind Vettel, but Hamilton moved ahead after an action with the wheels almost stuck that made the Ferrari driver have to reluctantly leave the free interior at the risk of resisting after a double move to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen, who turned 21 that day, started from the last row of the grid and placed in seventh place at the end of the first lap.
He then led a large part of the race as he clung to his tyres to achieve a quick finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
Finally, he entered the pits in lap 44, but was unable to increase his pace in the remaining eight laps by regaining Raikkonen's fourth position.
It’s been a tough day because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend and was a real gentleman in letting me pass.
The team has done an outstanding job to get a perfect pair," Hamilton said.
That was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Sen. Dianne Feinstein at a rally Saturday over her insistence that she didn’t leak Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court nominee, of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that what was happening in the Senate showed that there are people who are “bad, disgusting and false.”
“The only thing that could happen and the good that is happening these last few days in the Senate is when you see anger, when you see people who are bad, disgusting and fake,” he said.
“When you read the posts and the leaks, and then they say, ‘But if I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember him?
Dianne Feinstein, did you filter it?
Remember his answer... did you filter the document? - "Oh, oh, what?
- Oh, no.
I didn’t filter it.”
Well, wait a minute.
No, we didn't filter it," he added as he imitated the senator.
Feinstein was sent the letter detailing Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh in July and leaked in early September, but Feinstein denied the leak came from his office.
“I didn’t hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t leak his story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it confidential and so I did.”
But his refusal didn’t seem to sit well with the president, who during Saturday night’s rally commented: “I’ll tell you one thing: that’s been a really bad body language.”
Maybe he didn’t, but that’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested the Democrats were using the allegations for their own purposes.
"They are determined to regain power by any means possible.
You see the evil and the disgust, they don’t care who they hurt, who they have to run over to get power and control,” the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made up for the loss in the Elite League to the Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the game back on Saturday 5-3 at Dundee.
The Giants scored an initial two-goal advantage thanks to the attacks of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie won the local tie before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen's two goals secured his victory.
This has been the third loss of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe’s men, who had just beaten Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game of the season between the two teams, of which the Giants won the previous three games.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute (3:35) thanks to an assist from Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford provided the assist for Beauvillier to double the lead four minutes later.
In what can be considered a very lively initial period, Sullivan put the local team back up with the desire to play in the 13:10 minute before Matt Marquardt assisted Cownie to match the game in the 15:16 minute.
Dwyer made sure the Giants took advantage before the first break when he scored his second goal of the night at the end of the first half.
The local team regrouped and Bouchard once again matched the match with a goal in the 27:37 minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the game when the second half ended and secured victory with their team's fifth goal as the final close.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, play home to Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller dies so that hundreds of people can escape in the plane of the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died after making sure a plane carrying hundreds of people managed to take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many are missing after a large-scale earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Strong replicas continue to batter the area and many find themselves trapped among the rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his companions fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu airport control tower, which was being hit by a strong swing.
It remained firm to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could take off safely.
Then he jumped out of the traffic control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, Australian broadcaster ABC News reported.
We had prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
“Our hearts break when we hear this,” he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand people. The national disaster mitigation agency claims that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“It is believed that the number of victims will continue to increase, as there were still many bodies under the ruins and many people have not been able to contact us,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency, said in a statement.
Waves that reached up to six meters have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Aid and supplies are being brought on military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute an ambulance arrives with more bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Mini-markets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “Indonesia’s Red Cross is trying to help survivors as much as possible, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy in itself, but it could have been much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask everyone to work day and night to complete all evacuation-related tasks.
Are you ready?", CNN reported.
Indonesia had already been hit earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok in which more than 550 people died.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says a man has disappeared after air crash in a lagoon
The airline, which operates a flight that crashed into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now says a man has gone missing, after it said the 47 passengers and crew had safely evacuated the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon a male passenger could not be noticed.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for further details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were used to help rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been transferred to a hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact sequence of events remain unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
U.S. passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane arrived very low.
“That’s an extremely good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes comments that he and other travelers managed to advance through a water that reached their waists until the emergency exits of the plane that was beginning to sink.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a mild head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors performing near-by dock improvement work also helped in the rescue by using an inflatable boat to transport people ashore before the plane sank about 30 meters (100 feet) underwater.
Data from the aviation safety network indicates that 111 people have died in airline accidents registered in Papua New Guinea in the past two decades, but none with Air Niugini.
An analyst presents the chronology of the night a woman was burned alive
The U.S. Attorney’s Office completed filing its arguments Saturday in the new trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
U.S. Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he used mobile phone records to chain the movements of Quinton Tellis, the 29-year-old defendant, and Jessica Chambers, the 19-year-old victim, the night she died.
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones showing Tellis was with Chambers on the night of his death, contradicting his earlier statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his mobile phone had been with Chambers during the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford went on stage on Saturday and testified that he had not been in the city that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s van that night, Sanford said he was “lying, because my van was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said he had met Chambers about two weeks before his death.
Mobile phone records indicated that they met only a week earlier.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
“He erased her from his life,” Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its final allegations on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to remain in the hands of the jury that same day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio wants to fill their music with positive messages to challenge the negative image of the genre.
Bristol’s The High Breed claims that hip hop moved away from its origins from political messages and from dealing with social issues.
They want to get back to their roots and make conscious hip hop popular again.
Performers such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing her after a "racist" text
A New York nanny is going to sue a couple for discriminatory dismissal after mistakenly receiving a text message from the mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple denies being racist and compares the lawsuit to a case of “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dismay when she discovered that the new child care provider, Giselle Maurice, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Maurice twice.
After realizing her pawjob, an "uncomfortable" Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that his former nanny, who was African-American, had done a lousy job and was instead waiting for a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Maurice got paid for the day’s work and sent it home on Uber.
Maurice is now suing the couple for redundancy compensation with the intention of receiving compensation of $350 a day for the six-month internal job position he was hired for, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show you that things don’t go that way,” he told The Post on Friday, adding that “I know it’s a case of discrimination.”
The couple responded to claims that they are racist by saying that ending Maurice’s job was the most reasonable, as they feared they could not trust her after offending her.
"My wife had sent him something she didn't want to say.
She's not racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you leave your children in the hands of someone with whom you have been rude, even if it was by mistake?
To your newborn?
Come on! "
Comparing the lawsuit as an “extortion,” Plasco said his wife had given birth to the baby two months earlier and that she was in a “very difficult situation.”
“Are you going to go after someone like that?
That’s not that it’s a very decent thing,” the investment banker added.
Although the legal case is still ongoing, the court of public opinion has rushed to denounce the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and their logic.
Paddington editors feared readers wouldn’t identify with a talking bear, new letter reveals
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: “It was hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who first read it before it was published.
It’s really nice to know now what we know about Paddington’s great success.”
After saying that his father, who had worked as a BBC cameraman before drawing inspiration from a toy bear to write the children's book, was confident that his work would be rejected, he added that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was something "sweet" after his death last year.
De Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of our family,” added that her father was very proud of her final success.
“He was a very quiet man and didn’t like to brag,” he said.
“But as Paddington had been so real to him, it was almost as if you had a son who achieves something important: you’re proud of him, even if it’s not really your merit.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although it was his creation and the product of his imagination, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
Upon landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that the situation was really bad, that he wasn’t expected to make it,” Ms. Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got Nad’s call to tell me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be ready with you.
I'll be with you.
The drugs that the doctors had given him to keep pumping his heart were slowly running out and leaving his system.
She had died early and everything was turning off.
I could just sit there and wait, knowing all this was happening.
I couldn’t scream or scream or cry because I was in a situation surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now suffering from the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, alien to the terrible experience that was going on.
“Nobody knew,” he said.
"I bowed my head and tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
I needed all my love and understanding.
I knew how much I loved her.”
Women in mourning put cards to prevent suicide is a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide are working to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Tyler, the son of Mrs. Davis, was 13 when she began suffering from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
“I don’t want any parent to feel what I feel every day,” he said.
Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said his son was a promising chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him by his smile.
They always said that their smile would light up any place.”
However, he left the job before he died, as he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler’s brother, who was 11 at the time, was the one who found him after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said, “I am continually concerned that it may have repercussions.”
Davis created the cards “so that people know there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
You don’t feel silent, you have to talk about it.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost Mark, her partner with whom she had been with for 15 years, shortly after her mother’s death.
“He didn’t say he felt depressed or anything like that,” she tells us.
“A couple of days before Christmas we noticed his change of attitude.
Christmas Day came to its lowest point: when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t even look at them.”
He said his death was a great trauma for them, but they have to overcome it: "It leaves a void in the whole family.
It has left us shattered.
But we all have to keep fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
“I thought if we could really get something like what I was asking for (a limited-in-time, limited-range investigation), maybe we could bring in a little unity,” Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was “going to pieces” in the midst of a partisan shutdown.
Why did Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI investigation to take place?
Its refusal is entirely due to the chronology.
If, as is expected, Republicans have some bad results, their attempts to achieve the election of the man they want for the country's highest court will be severely weakened.
George W. Bush has been calling the senators, pressuring them to support Kavanaugh, who worked for him in the White House. Thanks to Bush, Kavanaugh met his wife Ashley, who was the President's personal secretary.
What happens once the FBI releases your report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm it for the Supreme Court.
North Korean defector numbers 'fall' with Kim
The number of defectors from North Korea to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Southern Unification Ministry, said there were 1,127 desertions last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said the stricter border controls between North Korea and China, and the high tariffs levied by human traffickers, have been key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments on the matter.
The vast majority of the northern deserters are finally offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers defectors to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and they are often repatriated.
North-South relations, which are still technically at war, have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks that focused on denuclearization negotiations.
This came after the historic meeting in June between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, who agreed in general terms to work for a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without U.S. confidence, there will be no confidence in our national security and, under these circumstances, we will by no means be the first to disarm unilaterally,” Ri said in a speech to the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s not fit to serve in Supreme Court
Nancy Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, said Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was a “hysterical” and not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I can’t help thinking that if a woman had acted that way, they would have said she was hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh used emotion to deny allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when the two were teenagers.
During his initial statement, Kavanaugh was very excited, sometimes almost screaming and choking as he talked about his family and his high school years.
At the committee, he also explicitly condemned Democrats, calling the accusations against him “grotesque and clearly coordinated defamations” organized by angry liberals because Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that, in his opinion, Kavanaugh’s testimony proved that Kavanaugh could not serve in the Supreme Court because it showed his bias against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualifies himself with those statements with and the way he has persecuted the Clintons and the Democrats,” he said.
Pelosi raised his objections when asked if he would challenge Kavanaugh in the event that he was confirmed in office and the Democrats won a majority in the House.
“I’ll just say one thing: if he’s not telling Congress or the FBI the truth, he won’t be fit not only to be on the Supreme Court, he won’t even be fit to be on the court he’s in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the Washington D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible sentences against the Affordable Care Act or the Roe Case against Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
At his confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
“This is not the time for a hysterical and impartial person to go to court and expect us to think everything is going well,” Pelosi said.
And women have to push it.
It’s a justified diatribe, months and years of rage overflowing, and she can’t let go without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's that weird, do you?"
He went on to say, “I was greatly helped by a woman who was an executive at some company and who told me that she also cried when she got angry, but that she had developed a technique that when she got angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to, ‘Maybe you think I’m sad because I’m crying.
“No, I’m angry.”
And then I continued with what I was doing.
I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed as a way out for anger in part because they are basically not well understood.
One of the clearest memories I have of one of my early jobs, in a male-dominated office, was once I found myself crying with inexpressible anger. An older woman, a serious manager I had always had a slight fear of, grabbed me by the elbow and dragged me down a staircase.
“Don’t ever let them see you cry,” he said.
"They have no idea you're angry.
They think you’re sad and they’ll be glad because they think you’ve been cornered.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential career.
In 1987, when Hart was caught on an extramarital adventure aboard a ship called Monkey Business for which he had to retire from the presidential race, it occurred to Schroeder that there was no reason not to explore the idea that she herself would run for president.
“It wasn’t a well-intentioned decision,” he told me in laughter 30 years later.
“There were already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Someone referred to us as Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
As the campaign was already very advanced, he was left behind in fundraising, so he promised not to re-enter the race unless he raised two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men, she was only given $250.
“Do you think I have a discount?” he asked.
When she delivered her speech to announce that she would not have a formal campaign, she was so overwhelmed by emotions (gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with a system that made it difficult to raise funds and that focused on recruiting voters instead of delegates, and anger at sexism), that she became hooked.
"The logical thing would have been to think he had had a nervous breakdown," Schroeder said, recalling the reaction from the press.
“You might have thought Kleenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to put on my tombstone?
“Did he cry?”
US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were deafening, and while there is still much left for the battle to end, a breakup between the countries could benefit Beijing, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, launched the first warning earlier this year by imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation took place this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) in goods, taxing half of the goods entering the U.S. from China.
On all occasions, Beijing has taken equivalent reprisals, recently imposing tariffs of five to ten percent on US products worth $60 billion.
China has pledged to match U.S. attacks, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-most powerful economy will soon slacken.
Getting Washington to back down would mean yielding to the demands, but publicly submitting to the United States would be too shameful for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, U.S. trade war pressures could positively help China in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can make the conditions to kickstart a slump in the economy in either country is actually much more dangerous than viewers have recognized so far,” said Abigail Grace, Asia-focused associate researcher for the Center for New American Security strategic office.
Syria is ready for refugees to return, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild a country devastated by a war that has been raging for more than seven years.
In a speech before the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country’s conditions were improving.
“The situation on the ground today is more stable and secure thanks to the progress that has been made in the fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in an attempt to restore normalcy.
All the conditions for the voluntary return to the country of the refugees who had to leave it due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and livelihoods are already given.
The UN estimates that since the war began in 2011, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country.
There are another six million people still living in the country who need humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem acknowledged that the Syrian regime would thank the aid to rebuild the devastated country.
But he also stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that promoted the insurgency.
Europe to host Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the North American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National, just outside Paris (France).
The United States has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil since the last time it won a Ryder Cup in Europe in 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had to fight for most of the tournament, threw his starting point into the water in the 16 par 3 hole, thus admitting his defeat to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari stood out in all his rounds, becoming one of four players who have never scored a 5-0-0 since the current tournament format began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth fell 5 and 4 to the player with the lowest ranking of the European team, the Danish Thorbjorn Olesen.
The world’s number one player, Dustin Johnson, fell 2-1 to England’s Ian Poulter, who could have played his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, a veteran who already has eight Ryder Cups, became the European with the most tournament wins of all time, with 25.5 points in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t help it.
It's been a very tough year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy that I was able to get the cup back.
It is an achievement of the whole team and I am very happy to have been able to help," said an excited Garcia after the victory of the European team.
He now passes the torch to his compatriot John Rahm, who already defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods by 2 and 1 in a singles match on Sunday.
“I’m incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods as I’ve grown up watching this man,” said 23-year-old golfer John Rahm.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a 13-21-3 record in his Ryder Cup career.
This is a strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, leaving only behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team had to fight all weekend to find the streets, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-level golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk spoke after his team’s disappointing performance: “I’m very proud of these guys, they’ve never stopped fighting.
There was a time this morning when we were warming up the situation in Europe.
But we're losing him.
I want to congratulate Thomas.
He's a great captain.
The 12 players played a very good game.
We will regroup, meet with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee, and move forward.
I love these 12 guys very much and I am proud to be their captain.
Now it's up to us to tilt our heads.
They have surpassed us.”
