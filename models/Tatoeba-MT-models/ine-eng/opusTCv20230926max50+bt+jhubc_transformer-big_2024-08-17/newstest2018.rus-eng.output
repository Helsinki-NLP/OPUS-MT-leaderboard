Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law on the introduction of administrative liability for violation of the deadline and procedure for payment of goods (works, services) when making purchases for state and municipal needs.
This law is intended to address the very acute problem of non-fulfillment of its obligations by customers in the implementation of public and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, a situation where entrepreneurs could not receive payment under already fulfilled state and municipal contracts was ubiquitous.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers, who concluded contracts not backed by financing, tried in every way to avoid payment obligations and included illegal conditions in the contracts.
The problem was systemic throughout the country.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the Prosecutor’s Office has submitted 9.7 thousand submissions, as a result of their consideration, 4.5 thousand officials have been involved in disciplinary responsibility, 533 administrative officials have been involved, and the investigative bodies for the organization of procedural checks have submitted 75 materials.
As a result, the debt to entrepreneurs in the amount of more than 66 billion rubles was repaid.
And these huge sums were accumulated far from the result of non-payment of multibillion-dollar contracts.
The fabulous debts resulted in numerous, systematic delays in the payment of services to entrepreneurs for much more modest amounts.
Here's a case in point.
The head of a small company won a competition to provide social transportation services for several million rubles.
The person invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled his obligations, but did not receive the money on time.
The result is a growing financial coma of debts on wages, taxes, loans, which would lead to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur did not seek help from the prosecutor's office.
In some regions, the problem has been minimized.
However, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts, identified by the prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation, amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt ratios continue to reach critical levels, the prosecutor’s office operates under manual anti-crisis management.
The Prosecutor-General personally conducts field meetings with representatives of the local authorities, where all violations discovered by prosecutors and measures to eliminate them are examined in detail.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of the Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On Amendments to the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences in respect of the Establishment of Administrative Responsibility of the Officials of the Customer for Violation of the Term and Procedure of Payment of Goods (Work, Services) for the Implemented by the President shall be able to qualitatively improve the payment discipline of public customers.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia at the initiative of the Prosecutor General’s Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Offences with an article that provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for the violation by the official of the customer of the term and procedure of payment of goods, works and services in state and municipal procurement.
And if an official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he will be disqualified for a period of one year to two years.
All prosecutors of the subjects of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative novelties in practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Group has issued a travel warning in Missouri.
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group’s statement reads as follows: “The National Association for the Advancement of Travelers of All Colored Territories, valid until August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, guests and citizens of the State of Missouri to be especially careful and to exercise increased caution when traveling around the state in conjunction with non-state travel.”
According to the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population, the group’s announcement of a travel warning was prompted by a recently passed law in Missouri that made it harder for people to win discrimination-related lawsuits, as well as the fact that state law enforcement agencies disproportionately often choose their targets as representatives of misogyny.
“You have people who are violating human rights.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of their skin, they are beaten and killed,” Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of the Colored Population of Missouri, told the Kansas City Star newspaper.
“We hear complaints more often than ever before.”
This is the first warning of its kind, announced by the organization in relation to the U.S. state.
The group cited incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of twenty-eight-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas during a state visit, and the Missouri State Police arrested him without charging him with a crime.
The warning also mentions a recent report by the Missouri State Attorney General’s Office that the likelihood of being stopped on the road for black drivers is 75 percent higher than for whites.
“The goal of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri,” he said.
“People should be prepared in one way or another, whether they take the money with them for a deposit or tell relatives that they are traveling across the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI’s Hate Crime Reporting Program, 100 hate crimes were registered in Missouri in 2015, making the state the 16th in the state in the number of such violations.
Also, the travel warning is a response to the new Missouri law, after which it will be more difficult to bring a case against a legal entity in connection with housing or labor discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) announced warnings for travelers to Texas and Arizona after these states passed new immigration control laws that ordered local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which, according to the ACLU, should have increased the number of convictions.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently public organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people were killed in the shooting of a police patrol in Egypt
Unidentified gunmen fired on a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reported, citing Egypt’s Interior Ministry.
During the shooting, two people, including one policeman, were killed, and three people were injured.
All the wounded were taken to the hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the attackers was arrested and the other managed to escape.
Rosturism supports the law on cancellation of free luggage for non-refundable airline tickets
The head of Rosturism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with RBC TV that "positive" refers to the adoption of the law on the abolition of free transportation of luggage with non-refundable air tickets.
“It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than the one who has luggage,” he said.
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite the fears of citizens, you will not have to pay for the transport of upper clothing and mobile phone in hand luggage.
"It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and to say about it, say that it is not going to have a relationship with top clothes, umbrella, mobile phone, iPad or even some computer," the head of Rosturismo said.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the rule on free carriage of luggage with an irrevocable air ticket.
The point is that airlines can determine the number of seats and weight of luggage included in the non-refundable tariff.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate the pollution of Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin at a meeting on the protection of Baikal said that in recent years, significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He instructed to identify sources of funding, plans and contractors for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also instructed to carry out a full recultivation of the contaminated territories.
“It is necessary to deal with the objects that continue to work here, the sewage facilities of most of them are worn out,” the president’s RIA Novosti quoted him as saying.
He also added that the Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia should conduct an inspection to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, in the area of the lake there are problems related to the appearance of natural landfills and a number of environmental violations by the organizers of the holiday.
"I want to emphasize this: not all in a row to check, here too the measure needs to know, but precisely - illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General's Office reported on the reduction of fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of objects subject to environmental monitoring.
Recall that on June 15, Vladimir Putin in the course of the direct line stated the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in the natural territories of the special protection regime.
He was informed of the problems with the conduct of economic activities by the inhabitants of the island of Olkhon, which is part of the Baikal Natural Territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature Sergey Donskaya immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the Baikal water protection zone, but the government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are related to a number of regulatory acts.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by amending the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
There will be a new temple in Yugra.
In the village of Sosva, members of the community from the indigenous small peoples of the North "Rakhtynya", together with the residents of the Berezovsky district take part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is a river bank, the temple will be well visible from a distance, so it will serve as a beacon for fishermen.
According to the representatives of the community, construction work will be completed already this year, now the domes are installed, church bells are available.
The Igrim REB fleet provided transport support.
The temple is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, as he is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron saint of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosov, fishing gives the settlers a job, feeds them.
Locals wait for the temple to open its doors, and children even write about it in school writings as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why are laws being enforced in Singapore?
I'm talking to a local businessman named Chang, sitting in an open-air diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, while the cucumbers are neatly stored in an iron box taken from the office.
After the conversation, the businessman goes to the nearest urn - to it a hundred meters - and throws bulls there.
The fine for garbage in a public place - 500 local dollars, - reports Chang.
You know, since I was a kid, I've had a reflex: you can't throw a phantom from a candy to a bridge, you'll be fined instantly.
And now there are video cameras everywhere.
And indeed, the sidewalks of Singapore in the center of the city are clean, like in a museum.
Three months ago, his neighbor’s 18-year-old son painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to a felony.
What?
Imagine that.
He received ten blows with a wooden stick on the buttocks and spent a week in prison.
corporal punishment is not uncommon.
How Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly strict laws, was understood on the spot by the observer of the AIF.
No one here is thinking of abolishing the death penalty, explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long been indifferent to the views of both the European Union and the United States on this matter.
If a person carries a large batch of drugs or trades them, he is given a hangman.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian man was detained at Changi Airport carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
In his defense, the Australian Prime Minister has threatened sanctions, international human rights defenders and even the Pope of Rome.
However, the guy eventually hung up anyway.
After that, the drug couriers are carefully touring our country.
The point is that in Singapore, it is the law that we have to follow everything in a row, not just the modest and poor people.
It doesn’t matter who you are: a millionaire, a vice-premier, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
One option in this case: if you find a half-kilo of cocaine, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and you see signs with a lot of warnings everywhere, you are surprised at how many prohibitions there are in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and you can buy it strictly on the prescription (!) of the doctor.
The tourist on arrival will not take the gum, but it is worth to paste "rubber" in the subway, a fine of 1 thousand local dollars will be imposed.
In four days, I met two people with white plaques on their necks: “I was rubbish.”
For the urns thrown by the smoker, in addition to the fine, they are often likened to a "link to the yard": a week to clean the parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles. pays the "criminal", who forgot to wash the water in the public toilet, and when trying to solve a small need in the elevator of a residential house a special detector is activated - the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the most exotic laws - bans on feeding pigeons on the street, public performance of songs and even excessive watering of the indoor plant (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers can not carry lighters in the subway, otherwise fined for 5 thousand Singaporean bucks.
In general, there is a thought: no matter how you try, you will definitely break something.
This is not the case at all, - Mohammed Kabir-Kadzaria, the owner of the local travel agency, is trying to convince me.
Especially fantastical laws exist only on paper, and for the last twenty years I have not seen anyone attracted to them for their violation.
Why do they persist?
So that the citizens do not relax.
Observance of the basic rules is strictly monitored.
Say, if a minor is sold cigarettes in the kiosk, then everything will be punished by the chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge amount, the violator himself will receive punches on the "back", and the seller will also be expelled and put in prison.
It is thanks to such strict laws that offences in Singapore are very rare.
Is that justified?
Back in the seventies, we had chaos on the roads – motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wanted, sat drunk behind the wheel.
After a year of fines, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, after drinking a portion of whiskey, knows: if stopped, the policeman will not be released for bribe, will impose a fine in the amount of the cost of the apartment and for years will be sent for the grid.
To many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems to be a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the Death Penalty" - a guest from the United States terrified the general wealth of residents, "a frighteningly clean airport" and "cultural nature".
To say that such things are unnatural, look artificial, and so in principle should not be.
The first few days in Singapore and you are afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, you catch yourself if you went to the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to the area "Little India", and suddenly - "break the pattern": plastic cups are poured at the bus stop.
“How is that?” you wonder.
That's right, the Singaporeans are smiling.
Everything happens.
Not every such "crime" will be caught on the spot, but you should know: if you are calculated, you will not get revenge - you have broken the law.
Most often, it is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, the power in Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Ho Chi Minh City, I was moving very cautiously – motorcyclists often snatch smartphones and cameras from the hands of tourists.
In the center of Paris is full of dirty bomges and begging.
In our streets, not everyone tries to throw garbage into the urn.
Singapore, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to the death penalty) laws, has become the most peaceful, clean and safe city on Earth.
You'll think about it.
Such is human nature: remember, and in Russia, no one was driving until they started to fine.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with laws.
And we should think that in Russia, people would also be happy about clean streets, the lack of garbage in the subway and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
It's corporal punishment, thank you, don't.
For the rest, Singapore’s laws are at least worth looking into.
Nothing sacred?
Now the Trump White House has targeted the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when he begins to fight statues.
Americans understand this no worse than everyone else – hence the deliberate theatrical demolition of the statue of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump administration, no doubt knew what he was doing when he carried a symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a fierce dispute with CNN journalist Jim Acosta over the president’s proposals to sharply reduce legal migration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try the statue itself.
Countless owners of pleasure ships and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would have lynched him if he had tried to do so.
But he tried to make sense of it, and especially of the meaning attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, when the poems of Emma Lazarus were added to the pedestal.
“I don’t want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.
The poem you are talking about was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.
Miller put the facts right, but as he himself said, it’s not really about the story.
This is about the current sounding of the striking words of Lazarus, the only ones in which the state invites not any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds, dreaming to breathe freely, / The unfortunate throws of your abundant shores."
Never before have “unfortunate throws” been so visible on our screens.
Miller was not engaged in literary studies - he made it clear that in America Trump these people are not expected.
This dispute over the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is indeed a dispute over the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who fought to place her words on the base of the statue after her death - understood very well that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to mark the connection between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a very different name: The Mother of the Exiles.
The combination of poetry and image was a brilliant feminist movement and a crushing attack on American nativism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right though to change it back.
Rash Limbo, a kind of John the Baptist who heralded the coming of Trump, reasoned in 2010 that Freedom does not invite anyone, rather it is an early neoconservative who carries the flame of America to the dark world: “Freedom goes forward.
It carries a torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the way to the United States.”
Against the custom Limbo really got to the point here.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would be seen by the exhausted, unhappy, but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often difficult voyage.
It means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people who are looking for refuge and a chance for a better life.
Her statue answers them with words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And, of course, this is not the prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to inflame hatred, which is the only source of their power.
2017 World Cup: Neil Blake highly appreciates the Scottish members of the UK national team.
Eileen Doyle remembers a time when there were only two Scots in the U.K. national team
Neil Blake, director of the UK’s Athletics Federation, said the 16-man Scottish side would make a “significant contribution to the team’s game.”
A record number of Scottish track and field athletes were selected for Friday’s 2017 London Championships.
Blake believes that “something special is being born” in Scotland and the UK Athletics Federation should take this into account.
"We know that and we're trying to understand and we're going to support them as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
“I’ve spoken to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it’s because of what they’ve done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks that what they have done needs to be worked on.
The British Athletics Federation: What they did, you have to work.
People on the street think the same.
I don’t know why it happened, but it’s brilliant.”
Some of the Scottish track and field athletes claim medals, including Laura Moore and Andrew Bachert – who will compete with Sir Mo Farah at a distance of 5000 m; and Eileen Doyle the team has chosen its captain.
"Eilid is modest.
Her captain's speech was great," Blake said.
“Many athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, and where they live or train, have come out of this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincere feelings that Eileen has put into it have been wonderful.”
The Commonwealth Championship silver medalist, who will run a 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championship, says the 16 Scots in the British national team are "incredible".
The previous record for the number of Scots at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
In front is Laura Moore, who specializes in middle distance running and broke five British and two European records last year.
She'll run 1500 meters and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Hare, who will compete in the 1500 m race, is another Scotsman worth paying attention to: behind his back he has a successful season, in which there were victories in the qualifying competitions of the British national team and in the annual competitions.
Doyle remembers his first World Cup, when the only Scotsman on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team’s captain says she is “incredibly proud” that so many of her compatriots have not only joined the team, but in some cases will qualify for medals and fight for the final.
"The captain of the team is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a huge honor in any case, but knowing that your teammates voted for you and chose you is a very special thing for me," she added.
"Of course, I am very proud of all the Scots who have joined the team.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all accomplished athletes who will strive to get on the pedestal of honor.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it’s just about how important it is to get support from the fans and take advantage of the fact that we’ll be back at the Olympic Stadium.
I got another chance to go to his arena and take part in the competitions, and the atmosphere there will be just wonderful.”
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don’t run for public office if you’re not willing to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
Americans loved George Washington, but that didn’t stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
His criticism, of course, irritated him.
But he didn’t shut his mouth to his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "It is possible to take away the freedom of speech and we, the deaf and dumb, will be led like sheep to the slaughter."
Now I’m going to move on to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan’s subordinates blocked and deleted posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's subordinates called the lawsuit null and void, and the comment on the Internet was written in the spirit of "well and what."
“It’s just Facebook,” many would say.
But that's important, too.
And this is especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He is an amazingly popular Republican governor in a mostly democratic state.
It is second in the approval rating among the 50 governors of the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He has demonstrated a firm hand in state administration and a commitment to its principles.
He also cleverly uses Facebook as the primary way to connect with his constituents and jokingly demonstrates on his page his bald head after chemotherapy.
Therefore, blocking people who come to the governor’s page – which is declared as an official public forum and is run by the administration’s employees for taxpayers’ money – is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with The Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia Ches defended the governor’s actions, arguing that blocking comments is simply a moderation.
But it’s too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers, and haters who are malicious on the Internet.
"Post" spoke to some of the real people that Hogan blocked.
And these are real people, not trolls, - a teacher, a businessman, a pastor, who turn to their elected leaders.
All of them say that their comments were respectful, substantive and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible as saying that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lakshmi’s lawyer Sarma Ramana of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
“I have written a polite comment that I am disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news,” she wrote in the comments section of the Post.
“I also don’t like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say it’s a so-called screwdriver, rather than admitting that they’re dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens.”
What the governor’s subordinates call a “concentrated spam attack,” others would probably call an “active life position.”
In the age of Facebook, it’s easy to edit your image by simply blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
This is a much less dusty job than it used to be when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical front pages, or arresting and mouthing protesters.
But that’s exactly what’s happening now, only in numbers.
Hohen is not the first official to be criticized for not wanting to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, twisty decisions on this topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James K. Casheris of Alexandria, the chairman of the Laudon County Supervisory Board violated the First Amendment by banning a voter from his Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bevin was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington’s day, the era of affordable postal spending has made about the same upheaval as today’s Internet.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers grew fourfold, and the authors of anonymous letters greatly eroded his authority.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the aliases “Yurikola”, “Valerius”, “Belizarius” and “Porcius” wrote letters to newspapers mocking Washington’s decision.
According to historical documents compiled by the online project "George Washington Documents", his office was flooded with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation.
But he didn’t try to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and speech lies at the very foundation of our state.
And true leadership means agreeing with that.
Ronan Rafferti hopes for home comforts at Renaissance Club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferti is hoping for home comforts for the next three days when the Renaissance club in East Lothian will host the twenty-fifth open Scottish golf tournament for senior athletes.
A native of Northern Ireland, who led the neighborhood in the Archerfield Links club and moved towards the final round last year until losing to Paul Ilsa, is attached to a new seat and serves as the tournament representative on behalf of club founder and director Jerry Sarvadi.
“I’ve seen the Renaissance club build, and we’re watching it succeed with this event,” Rafferti said.
“Players will see this field at its best, it’s in great condition.
Jerry did a great job arranging this place.
He is an ardent supporter of this game and is proud of his achievements here.
It’s a great demonstration for this field.”
The Englishman Ills looks forward to the opportunity to defend the championship title for the first time, despite winning both the European Tournament and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
“It’s a really special feeling,” said the Southport player.
“I couldn’t try to win the Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
To return to this corner of the world is magical.
This is a great place to play golf.
Memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife, Sharon, it was a very special feeling to win last year.
It was a really special time and we will always remember it.”
Returning to battle in his native country, Gary Orr, joined the European Senior Athletes Tournament after he turned 50 earlier this year.
The event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the 2013 Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open.
“When you play at home, it’s always a little bit more important,” said Helensboro resident Orr.
“You want to do well, but you feel that extra burden.”
I was very happy to play again, and I showed a good golf.
I’m happy with how it’s going so far.”
On the field, the trio will be joined by former Masters tournament winner Ian Woosnem and major champions for senior athletes Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the rest are Andrew Oldcorn, Steven McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Participation in the tournament is free, and parking costs <0xC2><0xA3>5 per hour if one person is in the car, and <0xC2><0xA3>10 if two or more people are in the car.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Fund.
British roads will learn how to absorb harmful emissions
The kind of tunnels over the highways, capable of absorbing carbon dioxide emitted by cars, are already being tested on the roads of the UK.
The country's transport agency, according to the edition of Autocar, reported on the positive results of tests of a 100-meter tunnel installed on one of the highways in the north of the country.
The 6-meter-high tunnel is built from some of the latest polymer materials that are capable of absorbing harmful substances contained in automobile exhausts.
However, the creation of a whole network of such tunnels is only part of the large-scale measures that the UK authorities are going to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the network of tunnels, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce road traffic, expand the use of commercial transport on electric traction and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, a quarter of all air pollution is due to transport, and unsatisfactory air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths a year.
The Moscow court changed the punishment of disabled Mamaev to a fine
The Moscow court changed the sentence of disabled Anton Mamaev, sentenced to four and a half years in the colony, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor’s office asked the court to replace the term with a conditional one, explaining its request that Mamaev’s disease “prevents his being in prison conditions.”
28-year-old Anton Mamaev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison for serving a sentence in the colony of the general regime for robbery, the victim of which was a former fighter of the special forces.
On July 19, the court at the departure meeting in SIZO released the man from custody.
Poverty and death in Indonesia's 'golden land'
After lunch, Bardina Degei does not use a plate.
It is rarely used even in pots.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Panay County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually simply places a sweet potato, which here is called a “note”, right in the center.
After half an hour, the charred tubers are harvested and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on the ground floor – she has no furniture – and it is here that she does her housework, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The toilet serves a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not allowed to work in the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men from this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
“No one decides to walk around the village after five in the evening,” she says.
This is a rare opportunity to look at everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a dubious referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote, publicly raising their hands in front of the occupying troops.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the government of Jakarta, which maintains tight control over the region without allowing foreign journalists and human rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, and the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupies the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is a city as remote as it is abandoned; the road here includes a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Jaipur, the administrative center of the province, to Nairobi, and then a five-hour shake by rental car.
There is no public transport here.
The city, with a population of about 19,000, consists of wooden houses lined with bamboo fences; corrugated steel roofs are painted with rust in a variety of reddish hues.
Few Indonesians came here, let alone journalists, and almost no foreigners.
Prior to the arrival of the Christian missionaries, the Papuan mee pago worshiped a god named Uga Tame.
There were other changes.
“It was unusual for us to wear these clothes,” Degey says, pointing to his bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
“We used to only wear leaves on our bodies.”
Papua is Indonesia’s poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
It is also the Indonesian Golden Land.
The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just sixty miles from Panay, a high-altitude province roughly the size of New Jersey, home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, Papua can boast of forest reserves, the cost of which is estimated at $ 78 billion.
These riches, however, entail one misfortune for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia’s powerful armed forces maintain their stifling presence here.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local servicemen and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
The demands for greater autonomy on the part of the Papuans threaten the existence of this golden vein and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights defenders, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured and deprived of their liberty.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass killings in the indigenous highlands of Papua in the 1970s can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
“We will lose everything”, a report published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture – especially frequent, as claimed in another report, rape and electric shock.
“It’s hard to count the number of victims because the incidents happen every week,” said Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
Hedges have been delayed as Papuan resources have attracted inflows of IDPs from other parts of Indonesia.
The province’s 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javan stews, "warungi", sell fried chicken and a mixture of vegetables "gado-gado", served with peanut sauce.
Locals are trying to keep up with the competition.
“Migrants started selling chicken and vegetables cheaper than the natives of Papua in the traditional market,” explains Abet Yoo, a twenty-four-year-old native of Panay who moved to Jayapura, the administrative center of the province, because of work.
“Because of this, the indigenous inhabitants of Papua – the mother-moms (women) of Papua – have lost their market.”
Indonesian President Joko Vidodo, known to the people as Jokovi, has vowed to tackle inequality and human rights violations in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, a former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of Papua’s 29 districts, including Panay.
But in Papua, almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel loyal.
“Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, expecting him to fulfill our hopes of restoring justice,” Yoo said.
In fact, only two months after the October inauguration of Jokowi Panay survived the tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were on the street singing Christmas hymns at a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers pulled out of the darkness on a motorcycle.
The frightened children told them to turn on the headlights.
According to local pastor Javadt Tebay, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and after a while returned with four soldiers.
According to victims and eyewitnesses, soldiers who were drunk chased children and beat them with rifles.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, sixteen-year-old Julianus Eimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby government building of the election commission, and the next day the situation worsened.
About 1,000 Papuan men, women and children gathered at a soccer field in front of a local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought with them ritual hunting bows and performed waita, a dance of the Papuan tribe mee pago: running around in circles and depicting birdsong.
Some protesters began to throw stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation escalated, the soldiers on the internal radio were ordered: “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them”, – so it sounded, as claimed in the official document, which was seen by the correspondents of the magazine “TIME”, but which was not published in the local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Jeremias Kayame, the head of the Quego Coto district in Enarotali, felt the approaching danger and called for calm, asking the crowd to disperse around the houses.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“When I turned around, I suddenly had a bullet in my left wrist,” he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired the shot, but says that the bullet came from the side of the ranks of the assembled soldiers.
“There was a crowd, there were a lot of shots,” he adds.
The local resident Alfius Youwa was hit three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
“I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him,” Johannes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told TIME.
“I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.”
General Yotje Mende, Papua’s senior police inspector, told reporters that his officers were only “protecting” their base because it was under attack.
“We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us,” said Commissioner Pujo Sulistio, a spokesman for the Papuan police in 2015.
“It’s a matter of life and death.”
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
The news of the killings reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Djokovic delivered a fiery speech in Jaipur in which he expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and vowed to address the issue of historical abuses of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be resolved immediately, so that it will never happen again in the future,” he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Viranto said he would set up a non-judicial organization to end historic human rights violations.
But they almost immediately apologized.
“Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some of them took place in the 90s or early zeros.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed,” he said.
Viranto then gave up his words, speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, and said he did not plan to set up an organization to deal with complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be decided through court.”
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of “crimes against humanity” over the deaths of more than 1,000 people during a bloody vote for East Timor’s independence in 1999, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the Panay incident.
The families of the victims from Paniai met with such statements with gloomy distrust.
“I’ve been asked four times in the last three years, but there was absolutely no change,” says Johannes.
“I am tired.”
He says that years later he's still living in fear.
“I’m scared,” he says.
"I'm afraid I'll be arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'll be shot."
His brother Jacobus also expressed the opinion that the inhabitants of Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four victims.
“After we buried the bodies, the military came after me,” he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police fired at villagers in the Deiyai district of Paniai.
In a clash between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help take a man unconscious to the hospital, one person was killed and 17 others were injured, including children.
A man, twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Dow, drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the office of the construction site owned by the company.
According to police, residents of the village threw stones at officers, who in response fired warning shots.
But locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) started shooting at the crowd and killed one person.
“We were in such a panic, we’re afraid of retribution,” Domingu Badia, a 29-year-old man who lives near the hospital, told TIME magazine.
“I hid at home for two days.”
The Deiai parliament demanded that officers involved in the incident be called to account, and the mobile police brigade was withdrawn from the region.
Paniya has always been a sick place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development is a source of discontent among the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the green-covered central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the “Free Papua Movement” (OPM), an insurgent army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by staging sporadic attacks and raids with kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the senior OPM leaders come from Panay, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, in recent years, thousands of people in Panay have been arrested and unjustifiably detained by the military under the pretext of “protecting national independence”.
Some of them never came back.
Among the population of Papua, Panay is considered a “sad, forgotten place”.
Poverty intensifies discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.
Bread is not available to the same extent.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly nuts, as well as some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can take care of four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold on the local market.
Ten club notes cost just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between indigenous Papuans and new migrants, who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nairobi airport, has increased.
Few existing vacancies are usually available to more educated and well-off migrants.
Papuans rarely have enough money or the necessary skills to run their own competitive business.
“Young people don’t want to stay in the village ... because there’s no work and no money here,” said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps Papua away from the views of the rest of the world.
In addition, the restrictions on the work of the international media remain strict.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basil Longshan were deported from Papua for "insufficient coordination with the relevant organizations" despite being granted rare permissions to videotape.
According to Felim Keene, deputy director for Asia at Human Rights Watch, Jokowi’s campaign promises to lift media restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
“Foreign journalists trying to report from the insurgent eastern Indonesian provinces, Papua and West Papua are now facing new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting,” he said in a statement.
The lack of attention from the press means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua’s immediate neighbours.
In March, six Pacific nations – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands – appealed to the UN Human Rights Council to investigate “various and widespread violations” in Papua, including the shooting in Panay.
The same countries have supported the OPM in the past.
A spokesman for Indonesia’s Foreign Ministry, Arramanata Nasir, rejected the group’s statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that “Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights violations.”
Locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by Dutch human rights ambassador Kijs Van Baar, visited Jaipur on 4 May, locals broke the silence, asking, “We want freedom,” as the source, who was also present at the meeting, claims, but wished to remain anonymous, said.
In Indonesia, there will be new presidential elections in 2019, but the Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Djokovic again.
“Jokovi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Panay shooting,” said Gobai, chairman of the tribe’s council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the inhabitants of Paniai, in addition to living in the shadow of the threat from the greedy army, are immersed in poverty, and their education and health care are in a miserable state.
Gobai says that the people of Panay, like the other Papuans, consider their vote given to Jokovi, a debt that he must pay.
“They don’t need money, they just want justice,” he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military plot.
Knowing that justice will probably never prevail, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
“They killed a member of our family,” says Jacobus, without raising his head.
“What else did we have to do?”
The fire for the second time covers the Dubai skyscraper "Fakel"
The fire engulfed one of the world’s tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to urgently leave a 79-story structure at 337 meters tall.
This is already the second fire that swept through the high-rise building – which coincidentally is called the “Fake” – in two years.
The building was evacuated, no human casualties were reported, and there was no operational news about the cause of the fire.
“We slept and woke up from fire alarms and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor,” a skyscraper resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Defense Administration, fire crews extinguished the fire at about 4 a.m. local time (00 a.m. GMT) and cooled the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelter to the victims.
The incident could put the safety issues of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world back on the agenda.
In the course of the investigation by the administration of “Fakela” after the fire there in 2015, it turned out that the most affected was the plaque – external panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believe that the insulation system and placarding panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London could speed up the spread of the fire there in June, which killed about 80 people.
The growth of tourist flow in Ida-Virumaa in June turned out to be minimal
As follows from the data that the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee received in the Department of Statistics, in June 2017 the services of hotel enterprises of the North-East benefited a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has decreased, and foreign tourists have increased.
In June, foreign tourist traffic increased by 7.3% (544 people) to 7,994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12,944 to 12,525 people.
The most marked increase in the number of Russian tourists in the region was 8.9% or 318 people compared to June 2016.
In total, in June 2017, 3885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed in Ida-Virumaa hotels.
Andrey Malakhov made it clear to fans who is to blame for his care
Andrey Malakhov hinted to his fans on Instagram, who are to blame for his departure from the "First" channel.
So far, he has not commented on the rumors, but today posted a fragment of the article of the newspaper "Vedomosti" for August 1.
Photo Malakhov signed the tag "boss milk sauce".
An article on how to prevent the "burning" of the employee and pay attention to his condition.
If you remember the numerous reports that the host could not find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who began to reformat "Let them talk", it becomes clear what he so transparently hinted at, writes "KP".
As reported, TV presenter Andrey Malakhov is currently on vacation and did not sign the application for dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation with dismissal may become clear in the coming days.
In Afghanistan, five military personnel were killed in a car bomb attack.
At least five servicemen were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Gilmend, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the police, the night before the military checkpoint in the district of Girishk exploded a mined car.
We know of 20 dead.
On Friday morning, a new PM took place in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange point.
The gunfight between the attackers and the security forces continues.
Diver shot a video of a shark biting his camera
Diver and explorer Greg Skomal captured a shark on video that bit his action camera GoPro.
The video was posted on Facebook by the U.S. Marine Fisheries Agency in the state of Massachusetts, whose employee is Skomal.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod peninsula in the northeastern United States, according to the Necn portal.
During the underwater swim, the man tried to remove the shark from the camera, which he held on a special stick.
Noticing the man, an animal more than three meters long sailed to him.
The shark began to bite the camera, while not trying to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator acted in this way to determine whether the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that such behavior of a marine animal turned out to be new for scientists.
The cause of the mass fight in the Ural military center became known
A working group of senior officers from the Central Military District arrived at the Elan Training Center, where a mass fight took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of this massacre have already become known.
According to Mash, who appeared on the page "VKontakte", the contractors of the Ural military unit number 31612 fought fiercely because of the uncontaminated bed.
It all started with the fact that a private named Sayan demonstratively ignored the officer’s order to refuel the lattice.
On the side of the officer stood soldiers from the sixth company.
Saina supported the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young boys smashed beds and sinks in the barracks, knocked out the glass.
More than 10 people were injured in the mass fight.
The CBI has denied information about the knife.
The study found that at least one-fifth of passengers in the U.S. carry prohibited items on a plane.
The study found that more than 20 percent of air passengers knowingly or accidentally carried prohibited items in their luggage on board the aircraft through U.S. Transportation Safety Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who boarded the aircraft without carrying prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Almost 1 percent reported that they later found that they accidentally carried firearms, ammunition, or explosives.
The study, conducted by charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and involving more than 1,000 people, also showed that young passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly trying to fly with something that was banned by the ATB, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X members.
Consciously past the employees of the ATB most often carry food and water.
More than 3 per cent admitted that they had specifically carried out the examination of sharp objects, and 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted that they had deliberately carried prohibited drugs into the aircraft.
The company said it was studying passengers across the country to find out how many of them were accidentally smuggled through an airport inspection, and how many were doing so knowingly.
It is expected that most often - consciously or unconsciously - smuggled through the examination of those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the ATB rules are quite complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what fluids they can carry and in what quantity.
Therefore, it is not surprising that most of what ATB selects are prohibited liquids.
Some time ago, people thought that ATB might consider it forbidden to carry a book.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
EPA chief Pruitt refuses to delay implementation of Obama's emission reduction rules
The day after the 15-state lawsuit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency canceled his decision to postpone the implementation of Obama’s rules designed to reduce emissions of air-polluting substances that cause smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by saying that his agency now listens more than in previous administrations to the needs of the environmental regulators of individual states.
He did not mention the lawsuit against his previous position filed in the Federal Court of Appeal.
The dispute revolved around the October 1 deadline to which states must ensure compliance with the 2015 ozone standards at the ground level.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay their compliance for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid “inconsistency with local decisions or obstacles to economic growth.”
Pruitt, who before being appointed by President Trump to his current position, was the attorney general of the state of Oklahoma, has long been known as a consistent opponent of tightening environmental standards.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of regulations that were opposed by the chemical or gas-oil industry.
An unexpected change of course on Wednesday is another legal defeat of the course taken by Peyton to return to the previous norms.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA chief exceeded his authority by trying to delay the Obama administration’s rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that, by dramatically changing course with respect to ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling the EPA’s obligation to cooperate with states in a comprehensive process of timely implementation of the new standards.
“In previous administrations, the EPA was often unable to meet the deadlines, then waited for lawsuits from activist groups and others, and discussed deadlines in the course of settling the case,” said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA at his previous post.
“We don’t believe in regulation through litigation, and we take the timing seriously.
We also take seriously our statute and the power it gives us.”
However, the EPA said in a statement that Pruitt may at some point re-use its "postponement powers and other statutory powers" to ensure that the rules "jcyjdfys on a clear track and on all available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader overhaul of the rules on ozone.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on the issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed suit against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
“The EPA’s change of course after our lawsuits is an important victory in the fight for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that is covering their cities,” Schneiderman said.
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia joined the lawsuit.
Ground-level ozone occurs when conventional pollutants from machinery, power plants, oil and chemical plants, and other sources enter the atmosphere in response to sunlight.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in people sensitive to it, leading to thousands of premature deaths per year.
Health advocates and environmentalists welcomed the unexpected shift in the course of Pruitt.
“It’s sad to think about how much pressure it took to achieve this completely logical step from the person who’s tasked with protecting the air we breathe,” said Lori Ann Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
“We must continue to resist the Trump administration’s ideological campaign and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests.”
Congress of the IAAF extended the removal of the All-Russian Federation of Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the removal of the All-Russian Federation of Athletics (VFLA).
The Congress thus supported the IAAF’s Board for the Restoration of the FAA, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the repeal be left in place.
166 people voted in favor of the extension, 21 against, reports TASS.
The report of the IAAF Council stated that WFLA had made significant progress in achieving the conditions set by the Membership Restoration Council, but these conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the VFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian athletes were forced to perform under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championship.
The IAAF was disqualified indefinitely by the IAAF in 2015.
At that time, the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was published, which spoke about numerous violations of the WADA regulation, admitted by Russian officials and athletes.
For more information on the latest report of the IAAF Council, see “IAAF Extends Sanctions on WFLA.”
Offensive defeat
As part of the 3rd round of the Russian Fonbet Championship among the PFL teams, the Novomoskovsky "Khimik" held a away match against FC "Kaluga".
A little more than 10 days ago, the rivals played each other in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture of the game was completely different.
"Chemist" in no way inferior to the opponent, but the second relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After a recent defeat from the Kaluga with a score of 0:3, many predicted a slight victory of the hosts in advance.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the New Moscowers were forced to consider themselves and acted from a defense, but from a position of strength.
In the 1st time, the Kaluzhans built more and had an advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was held by Alexei Syrotin, who repeatedly reflected dangerous blows and with his actions gave the partners confidence.
Unfortunately, the attack "Chemistry" lacked the effort and luck to put in a stop defense "Kaluga" and score the first goal on the way out.
After the break, the game began to take place on opposite courses.
The New Yorkers were more active in the attack.
Worrying bells for our team became errors in defense, which allowed the monks to create a number of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, Chemik intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the monks played a role - they more competently and coolly held the end, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After the dangerous attack, the Chemist transferred the ball to the corner, the supply of which the owners of the fields without resistance was transferred to the gate.
The author of the goal was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, "Chemistry" demonstrated a good game, but suffered an insulting defeat.
In front of our team is waiting for another departure - on August 11 at 7 pm in Moscow at the "Torpedo" stadium named after Eduard Streltsov, the Novomoskovskys will fight with the favorite of the group "Center" FC "Ararat", which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko.
Come and support the Chemist!
The place and time of the meeting of the Novomoskovskites - 6:30 p.m. near the store "Magnolia" (Vostochnaya, d.2, corp.
Composition of "Chemistry": Syrotyn, Manokhin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogia (Oreshkin), Dudaites, Ryzhov, Saints, Belyanin (Adoyevtsev), Andreychenko (Lygin)

According to published transcripts of phone calls, Trump has pressed Mexico about the payment of the wall at the border
The Washington Post has published transcripts of phone conversations between U.S. President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a Nieta, Trump insisted that he stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for the planned wall at the border.
The President of the United States accused him of publicly speaking against the wall, and, according to leaked information, told him: “You can’t tell the press.”
Trump began his election campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to force Mexico to pay for the project.
In a published transcript of his first phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, a hot-button switch was also found.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement under which the U.S. should accept refugees heading to Australia was “ridiculous,” “disgusting” and “dumb,” and insisted that because of the agreement signed by the Obama administration, he would look like an idiot, as he intended to stop the resettlement.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that “it was the most unpleasant conversation of the whole day.”
Bodies of tourists killed in Abkhazia sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane, owned by the airline "Russia", on board which are the bodies of the dead in Abkhazia, flew at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, reports TASS.
At the place of the final point of follow-up, the board will meet with employees of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city's mayor, Deputy Minister of Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamir Ahba told reporters.
Earlier, the representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic said that all costs associated with the delivery of bodies back to Russia were borne by the Government of Abkhazia.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay compensation in the amount of 500,000 rubles to the families of the victims.
According to Ahba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed willingness to pay the relatives of tourists who died as a result of the explosions to fly and stay in the republic, but relatives sent to the republic only the authority to the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, in the village of Primorsky Gudautsky district in the warehouse of missile and artillery weapons of the Ministry of Defense of the Republic, two explosions broke out, after which large-caliber shells and other ammunition stored there began to be detonated.
As a result, there was a fire in the warehouse, which provoked uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
As a result, two Russian citizens died - Elena Polyakova born in 1970 and Elena Timofeeva born in 1962, who were on vacation near a hydrogen sulfide source.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with injuries of varying degrees of severity were taken to the medical institutions of the republic.
Currently, there are seven people in the hospital, the rest are discharged.
Study of the Russian influence on the American elections will be taken by a large jury
Russia’s special prosecutor Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington to examine Russia’s influence in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offences and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The materials collected will be examined by the special prosecutor and will decide whether they are sufficient to bring charges.
The convening of a grand jury gives Mueller additional powers to collect evidence.
One of the topics of the investigation of the jury, which began work a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting of the son then still a candidate for president Donald Trump with the Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitska.
The details of this meeting, which took place in June 2016, were previously promised by Mueller himself.
They've already been investigated by the FBI.
In late July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded the staff of his lawyers.
Trump Jr. had previously said that he expected a compromise on the headquarters of the candidate from the Democratic Party Hillary Clinton from a meeting with Veselnitska, but no revealing documents were presented, and in the end it was about adoption.
At the beginning of August, information appeared in a number of media that the statement of Trump Jr. about the meeting with Veselnitska was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House said the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority to do what any father would do.
Deputy Mayor Penza Detained at Work
Deputy head of the Penza administration Irina Shirshin was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at his workplace, RIA Novosti reported.
There have been no official reports from law enforcement in this regard yet, but the press service of the SC SC has assured that they will soon follow.
The mayor’s office has yet to comment on what happened.
Irina Shirshin is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has been supervising urban planning and land relations, holding this position since April 2015.
Prior to that, she worked for a long time as head of the State Civil Engineering Inspectorate in the Penza region.
Irina Shirshin is raising three minor children, it is noteworthy that once again becoming a mother a year ago, she refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, in Mexico there is no cosmodrome or carrier rockets.
But there is a space agency established in 2010 and the desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of the bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first person who visited space.
Unlike the monuments of the Soviet period, which are demolished in some countries, Gagarin's monuments, on the contrary, "step on the planet".
In 2012, the monument was installed in American Houston near the former headquarters of NASA.
In London, a monument on the grounds of the Royal Observatory was erected in honor of the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfut, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of the 70th anniversary of Gagarin in Riga, a monument to Yuri Gagarin appeared.
This is how the name of the first cosmonaut sounds in Latvian, and it looks like he is 70 years old.
Murder of Morse Ford: Activists Lose Lynch Trials on Stage to Call for Justice
In 1948, Ford Mercury drove past spectators in the village of Monroe, Georgia, and roared toward the small Mors Ford Bridge.
When the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked her way.
The main man - a middle-aged man in a thin striped suit - stretched out a cigar and looked through the windshield.
Those who sat inside trembled with fear.
"We need this nigger, Roger!" the man said.
"Get him out of the car!"
The piercing screams broke the silence as the young black man was pulled from the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene, which took place on July 22nd, is just a production.
But when Roger's neck was thrown in a loop, almost all the spectators really took their breath away.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Mors Ford Bridge to re-lose the night in 1946 when puppeteers lynched two black couples — Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one was convicted of these murders.
“It’s amazing that in all these years no one has been arrested — even though we see them around us; even though we know who they are,” says Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the production.
“It’s a stain on our history and it’s a stone on our souls.”
Brooks, 71, is a former congressman from Georgia who has been fighting for human rights his entire life.
For him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been rectified.
“We want investigations, we want closures, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice,” he says.
“We cannot move to healing and reconciliation until justice is done.”
The coroner covers the body of one of the victims of the lynching at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI materials obtained by the NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of participating in the lynching.
But no one has ever been charged.
Although the suspects remained at large for decades, human rights activists say that the city has always been well aware of two related motives of the lynchings: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens for the first time to vote for the primaries to be held that summer.
Around the same time, according to the FBI, a black supporter, Roger Malcolm, struck a knife in a fight with Barnett Hester, a white landowner, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says that rumor has it that Hester slept with Malcolm Dorothy's wife, and that the baby she was supposed to give birth to was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 in bail to free Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But when they drove out of prison and approached the Mors Ford Bridge, a mob of lynched men surrounded the car.
“It turns out that he organized and commanded the murders of Harrison,” the FBI said in a report.
“It is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and city law enforcement agencies that not only took part in the killings, but also destroyed the evidence and concealed the identities of the witnesses.”
Brooks calls it short.
“It was an attack on the right to vote,” he says.
“They were all killed to send a signal to black people in the city: if you register and vote, you will be the same.”
For nearly a decade, Cassandra Greene has been directing the annual play, reproducing that lynching at the Mors Ford Bridge.
Its spectacle is vivid, it captures the audience and tells the story of the deep racism that many would like to consider no longer exists in America.
It’s hard to look at and even harder to turn away, but Green believes that’s what matters.
“We don’t want to talk about Lynch’s courts because they show us our own ugliness,” she says.
“But I can’t build a relationship with you if you don’t hear me or hear what I’ve been through.”
Rehearsals of this year's performance began in June, and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen whites, the rest blacks - gathered in the room and listened to a review of the play, polished over the years.
Wade Marbo was the director with Greene.
He played the role of the main member of the clan for several years, but says that the role never got easier.
“I feel like I’m messed up because that’s not the person I am,” Marbo says.
“But I think it’s very important to remember this story because we don’t want to go back to that time.”
In the room, actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascon, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, repeat their roles.
The show begins with Malcolm, angry that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Screams Raskona in response.
It's a hit.
And at the same time, all (at least all black actors) are outraged.
Green laughs louder than anyone.
"What is it?" asks Ascona.
He's worried and confused.
Am I overplaying?
“No,” Greene said with a laugh.
“I just don’t think the whites were saying ‘nigga’ then.”
"Yes," one of the black performers laughed.
"You've got to make a solid 'R'."
And so the energy in the room changes: discomfort is replaced by a sense of companionship.
Everyone must do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the sake of the memory of the four people killed.
The scene begins first.
This time, when Rascona speaks the word to the letter "n", it turns out to be clear and sharp.
No one laughs.
The show ends abruptly and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
The woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of the actors and performs the sad song of Billy Holiday "Strange Fruit".
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
In a hundred yards from her, half a hundred spectators wipe away tears and sweat from their eyes.
The audience is almost the same number of blacks and whites.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York to watch the show; many live right next door.
They all endured Georgia’s heavy spirit for nearly eight hours while Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the Malcolm and Dorsey graves.
Until that moment, the killings were only a story, but now that they are standing in the same place where they lynched people, it seems that their ghosts live right in the air.
When the last note of the song stops, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children bend to their heads, touch the paint that depicts blood, and still bodies and whisper something to each other.
“They’re not really dead,” one little boy mumbles, as if to remind himself of it.
In a few minutes, Green thanks the audience, and suddenly it's over.
The actors drop the ropes from their necks and wipe away the tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the main puppeteer.
Nick Rascona hugs two other actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the show finally fell on him.
"It's all right," whispered one of the women.
“We know you have a good heart.
You had a reason for that.”
Later, the audience will sit down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta vividly discusses the show with a black couple they have just met.
Deniza Daplinski is struggling to find the words to describe what she feels after the performance.
“It’s hard to listen to these horrible, horrible words and actions... people who look like you and who do it because they look like you,” she says.
“After that, I think lynchings are still happening,” she adds, “only now it’s called shooting by the police.”
In the other corner of the room, Tyron Brooks, who remembers his work as a human rights defender, received general attention.
He says he has already started planning for next year’s show.
“The production inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we’ve experienced, but also teaches us,” he says.
“Because if you don’t learn from this lesson, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it.”
The court fined Navalny for violations on the "agitation Saturday"
The Simonov court of Moscow fined Alexey Navalny 300 thousand rubles for violation of the order of organizing the rally.
The oppositionist was found guilty of committing an administrative offence provided for in part 8 of Article 20.2 of the Russian Civil Code "Repeated violation of the order of the organization of the rally".
Earlier, the judge of the Simonov court of Moscow Hyzyr Mussakayev finished considering the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the head of the staff of the opposition Alexei Navalny, who was brought to justice under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300 thousand rubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev estimated the distribution of leaflets on the “agitation Saturday”, which Navalny’s supporters held in Moscow on July 8-9.
Seeing the agitating materials that monitored the participants of the Sabbath, the police thought that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed its true essence - public action (for which it is necessary to request permission from the capital authorities in advance).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuev applied for the termination of administrative proceedings in connection with the absence of the composition of the offence and pointed out that the police allowed certain failures in the preparation of the protocol.
Volkov was not detained on the very “agitation Saturday”, but he received an agenda obliging him to appear at the police station to talk about the event, held with his active participation.
The same agenda was received by Navalny himself and another associate of the opposition - Nikolai Lyaskin.
In Mordovia, the murdered bride and three wedding guests were arrested
A court in Mordovia has arrested a local resident who shot four people at a wedding, including a bride.
This was reported in the Republican administration of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29.
During the dispute, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk shot several times at guests of events that came to the rural pond to bathe.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case has been initiated under paragraph "a" of part 1 of Article 213 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Hooliganism"), part 3 of Article 30 and paragraphs "a", "e", "and" of part 2 of Article 105 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Attempt to kill two or more persons committed in a generally dangerous manner, out of hooligan motives").
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire due to the fact that the wedding guests, having decided to take a bath, passed through the territory of his plot to the water.
Ministry of Energy will tighten the requirements for suppliers of turbines for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
At the launch of gas turbines, hydropower turbines, oil rigs and oil extraction facilities, equipment suppliers will undertake to share data on access to it with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft Government resolution has already been prepared and submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will only affect “critically important energy equipment” supplied to Russia.
Potential threats in the document are such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of the object by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
The European Union has extended anti-Russian sanctions due to Siemens
On August 4, the European Union's press service said that anti-Russian sanctions had been extended due to the scandal surrounding the supply of Siemens turbines to Crimea.
This was previously reported by “Arguments of the Week”.
The press service of the Council of the EU said that the sanctions against the Russian Federation were extended due to the scandal with the Siemens production turbines, which were allegedly delivered to Crimea to circumvent the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals by member states to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was reported that the final decision will be made by the end of the current day, and here the decision is made, sanctions against Russia are extended.
Pearson Cuts Another 3,000 Jobs and Cuts Dividends to Bring Business Back to Life
On Friday, the British education group Pearson announced that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and reduce the amount of preliminary dividends by 72 percent in connection with the start of another restructuring program aimed at tackling the problems faced by their business.
These job cuts, which, according to company chief John Fallon, will mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut during the previous restructuring.
Pearson has announced that it plans to cut spending by another <0xC2><0xA3>300 million ($394 million) in May during a third cost-cutting program to try to bring back to life a business that has been hit by a rapid shift to digital learning methods.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsman, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1 percent increase in sales of the main product in the first half of the year to $2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: Nato soldier killed in suicide bombing
According to official sources, the suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and a translator were wounded, according to a NATO statement.
According to unverified data from local sources, as a result of the incident in the urban area of Karabakh also killed three civilians.
The blast is the latest to hit Afghanistan this month, killing more than 30 people as a result of Tuesday’s explosion at a mosque in Herat.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO, the explosion that occurred on Thursday evening occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with the help of a “man-portable man-made explosive device.”
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and receiving treatment at the American military hospital at Bagrama airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and a group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed nearby in Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilian casualties occurred in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, and about 20% of them in the capital.
At the end of July, an explosion of a suicide bomber in a car killed at least 30 people in the Shia area of Kabul.
The Taliban said they had carried out the attack.
On May 31, a powerful explosion in the city centre killed more than 150 people, the country’s deadliest in terms of the number of human casualties since the U.S.-led military removed the Taliban from power in 2001.
Violence accentuates the precarious situation in Afghanistan, while U.S. President Donald Trump assesses whether to increase the number of U.S. military forces assisting troops and police in the country.
According to the correspondents, the terrorist attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its line of conduct, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
The Environmental Protection Agency cancels the decision to postpone the adoption of the law on air pollution
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned a decision to postpone the passage of the Obama-era law that states must limit air-polluting emissions a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called “Ozone measurements 2015”, stressing that this step shows the agency’s willingness to cooperate with the states.
“We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and responsiveness to them,” Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency's intention to postpone ozone measurements, in which existing air pollution is measured in different parts of the country, to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet the stricter standards of air cleanliness, for one year, until the end of 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly Democratic, along with the Federal District of Columbia filed a lawsuit alleging that the intent was illegal.
President Donald Trump’s administration is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental protection rulings introduced by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader program aimed, Trump said, at brilliant economic growth.
But actions in this direction have provoked resistance from Democrats and environmental organizations concerned about the possible impact of large emissions on public health.
The Environmental Protection Agency’s website says that the use of ozone-containing air for breathing “may impair lung function and exacerbate respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.
The Association of European Business spoke out against new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association has expressed disagreement with the U.S. economic sanctions against the Russian Federation.
According to AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
In a statement, the AEB said that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so you can not limit the principles of free trade.
The European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the US and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and agreement.
Deputies ask the police to limit movement on the embankment in Pskov
Pskov people's elected representatives sent an appeal to the head of the UMVD in the city Sergey Surin on the problem of movement along the embankment of the Great River.
Deputies of the pride Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Storonenkov and Valeriy Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
In their opinion, the control of the drivers will help to make this area more calm and safe.
The problem is that violators ignore the signs of the "walking path" and freely ride along the embankment.
It turns out that the overhaul and improvement was carried out in vain.
Sports and children's playgrounds due to cars become uncomfortable.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, in the evening the central embankment is patrolled by the employees of the PPS motor patrol and spouses.
Thanks to them, the number of passing cars becomes smaller, but the movement does not stop completely.
Putin urged investigative bodies not to remove hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed to ban investigative bodies from removing servers and hard drives from work computers at enterprises.
This was stated by the head of state at the meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the President, “it is necessary to exclude the use in the interests of investigation of measures leading to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from work computers and servers.”
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, “it is enough to take copies, certify them and use them in the course of the investigation.”
The head of state added that it is not possible to "create conditions that prevent the continuation of the activity of the enterprise until the impossibility of paying taxes."
Olga Buzova told how much she wanted to call her ex-husband
TV host Olga Buzova admitted that she really wanted to call her ex-husband - football player Dmitry Tarasov.
At the moment, the celebrity is in the United States, where he deals with labor issues.
Literally the day before, Olga visited Las Vegas, after which she decided to publish a post on Instagram.
She said that she did not marry, did not make any new tattoos, and did not name her ex-wife with the words that he ruined her life, although she wanted to do it.
Buzova said that she will remember this trip forever, because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy has died.
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the Minister of Magic Cornelius Faj in the film adaptation of a series of novels about Harry Potter, died at the age of 92.
This was reported by the newspaper "Independant" on Thursday.
The death of the actor was reported by his relatives.
According to them, he lived "a huge life, having achieved success in film, theater and television for 70 years of his career."
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, on the stage of the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, he played with Lawrence Olivier in The Tragedy of Coriolanus.
Hardy has also been remembered for repeatedly performing the roles of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of Agatha Christie's film adaptations of Miss Marple.
For his role as Churchill in the BBC television drama "Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years" (1981), he was awarded the British Academy of Cinematography and Television Arts (BAFTA) Award.
Hardy has also served as President of the United States Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Something rotten in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean André, Count de Laborde, refused to be buried together with his wedded wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, the four have a "golden" wedding, but in the agenda of the couple - not preparation for the celebrations, but a morbid dispute.
His highness refused the title of prince-consort, while he embittered the queen that she had never complained to him about the title of king-consort.
Henry lives in France, although he remains officially the Queen's husband.
Russia's Foreign Ministry urged Washington to stop shelling Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry responded to the statements of Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was circulated by the Foreign Ministry some time ago.
In its comments, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using cold war stamps that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats urged the US authorities to stop shelling the Russian Federation.
As the “Arguments of the Week” wrote the day before, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and organize a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is talk about the possibility of a decisive match
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who appear to be steadily moving to hold the most exciting boxing match of up to 147 pounds in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of the ESPN channel in Los Angeles, while Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, did not pass the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the champion of the World Boxing Organization in the second half of the weight.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former world champion in four weight categories Erian Bronner on Saturday on the Showtime channel, both boxers are among the top five boxers regardless of weight categories.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, “What’s up, champion?
Good luck to you.”
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven o'clock in the evening on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, manager Lomachenko Egis Klimas noticed that a potential decisive battle between them would be at once.
“I used to be half-eaten,” Garcia recalled.
“I went up to the category for Bronner [up to 140 pounds], but I’m not that big.
I'm not enough for 140.
I want to go down to the semi-light.
And he needs to get up to the semi-easy [up to 135 pounds], and then we'll have a fight.
This is what the fans want.
Let’s get them to do it.”
Lomachenko agreed.
“Boxing needs this fight.”
Klimas asked whether the fight should be broadcast through the PPV service, as part of the strategy that he adheres to after the war, that Lomachenko had his debut fight in the weight of 135 later this year, to appoint next summer a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who is also interested in winning with Liz to win.
“The fight could be on PPV because all the fans asked for it,” Garcia said, later expressing willingness to fight on the channel that will offer the best financial conditions.
“We are the main names.
No other name would be of such interest.
As soon as they are ready...”
Garcia said he considers Lomachenko a “shocking boxer” and may visit his Saturday match.
But Lomachenko did not immediately shower Garcia with praise and said that, in his opinion, the three-weight champion from Riverside looks "very slow, sorry, Mikey ... you asked for a knockout".
Garcia said he focused on showing the power of the punch, and then boxing.
They both said they felt the tension growing in front of their own fight.
“This battle must take place.
No other fight is as much of an interest and conversation.
I’m more than happy to work on it,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I was waiting for someone from the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey.
It will be a great fight.”
On several central streets of Moscow will block traffic for the weekend
This weekend, 5 and 6 August, traffic will be limited in the capital on the Tverskaya Street section from Nastasyinsky Lane to Triumphal Square, as well as traffic on the 1st Tver-Yamskaya Street.
In addition, the passage will be closed on Leningradsky Avenue, from the Third Transport Ring to the 1st Tver-Yamskaya Street.
At all sites, the cover will operate on both lanes, according to the information center of the Moscow Department of Transport.
The streets will be closed from midnight on August 5 to 5 am on August 7 due to their improvement.
Also in the weekend will be closed traffic on the Moskvoretska embankment.
The construction of the "Zaryadye" park continues there.
Putin instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed the Prosecutor General’s Office of the Russian Federation to conduct an inspection of the territory of Baikal on the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities.
"I ask the Prosecutor General's Office to check the Baikal territory for the facts of illegal and environmentally harmful activities," Putin said at a meeting on environmental development in the region.
In addition, the Russian leader asked to take action if the facts of the violations will be revealed.
New test results published to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest results of tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new method of medical assessment of age, show that more than 80 percent of those tested were assessed as persons over the age of 18, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (R<0xC3><0xA4>ttsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the assessment of age in the asylum process more accurate, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to determine the actual age of some refugees who claimed they were minors.
At the moment, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensic agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of those tested were assessed as people 18 years of age or older, and in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency estimated that the test subject was “probably a person 18 years of age or older.”
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion was that a person is “probably under 18”.
Tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person causes doubts.
According to Johan G<0xC3><0xB6>ransson of the Agency for Forensic Medicine, the results correspond to the results of the past months.
“We don’t see a big difference with the statistics over the past months, the numbers are quite appropriate,” he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as under 18 years of age does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that in 442 cases, “most likely, the age tested was 18 years or older.”
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases, a person openly stated that he was turning 18 this year.
The method of conducting a medical age assessment, consisting of making wisdom teeth x-rays and tomography of the knee joints and giving them for analysis to dentists and radiologists, has also caused criticism in some instances.
One of the skeptics is an endocrinologist from the Carolinian Institute, Claude Marcus, whose work is part of an assessment of people’s biological maturity in order to determine whether they went through sexual maturation earlier or later than usual.
“I had reason to think about it, and I don’t think you need to use the measurement methods that are being used now.
The biological age is thus determined very inaccurately.
If we can’t define it with confidence, we shouldn’t pretend we can,” he told the Metro newspaper.
However, G<0xC3><0xB6>ranssen from the Agency for Forensic Medicine said in favor of the accuracy of the tests: “In general, it can be said that the risk of mistakenly taking a child as an adult is small.
The biggest risk we face is when a person will soon be 18, in which case he is about 10 percent.”
I'll see if I can run for president.
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was ready to think about whether to run for president of Russia in the 2018 elections, reports Interfax.
This statement was a response to the request of the residents of the village of Cheremushki Buryat region.
During a video conference dedicated to the elimination of the fire in Buryatia and Irkutsk region, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request to you: when the next presidential election will be, we ask all of you to run again for this post."
"Well, I'll think about it, thank you," the president said in response.
On July 28, the press secretary of the President of Russia Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that the election headquarters of Vladimir Putin will be headed by the head of the administration of the President of the Russian Federation Anton Vaino.
Peskov called these assumptions "nothing based on hypothetical reasoning."
“There are no headquarters yet, before the establishment of headquarters far away, before the election campaign far away,” Peskov said.
“It’s not on the agenda yet,” Peskov said.
The Governor of West Virginia has announced that he is moving to another party.
West Virginia Governor and Democratic Party Representative Jim Justis announced Thursday during a rally with President Trump to move to another party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me,” said Governor Justice.
“Today I am speaking to you with many prayers and many reflections ... today I am telling you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be of any use to you as a Democratic governor.”
The rally exploded with applause.
“That’s why tomorrow I’m going to change my registration to a Republican,” Justice added.
“As a coach, I would tell you that it’s time to play differently.”
Earlier, Trump promised that an important statement would be made at the rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with a 42 percent lead, and Justice did not support Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton.
Justin, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
In the meantime, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night that “Governor Justice’s transition to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party that is hindering rather than working to make our country great again.”
“Given only 15 governors and the control over the smallest number of state legislatures in history, the statement by Governor Justice is just another rejection of the party, which has no leaders from the top down and is unable to find a positive, unifying message,” the Republican National Committee representative said in a statement.
Mr. Krasavchyk found a home thanks to social networks
Pitsboro, North Carolina, U.S.A., has a cat named Mr. Beauty weighing more than 14 pounds after it became famous thanks to the internet.
This is reported by Mashable.
At the end of June, a photo of a cat asking to find its owner was posted on the cat’s Facebook account because “someone had obviously fed it before.”
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the muzzle of the animal can become a new meme.

Cow praises Russia’s “sincere” apology over doping scandal
International athletics expert Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called a sincere apology from Russia in connection with the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the right time to allow the country to participate in sports competitions again.
The Russian representative of the athletics federation Dmitry Shlyakhtin told at the congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which took place on the eve of the World Championships in athletics, that the removal of his country from sports competitions was fair and that he is determined to fight.
He apologized to "all the athletes who were stolen gold and silver medals at the competitions".
Despite his comments, the Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of state-funded doping use.
“It seemed to me that today’s response, today’s report, was very sincere,” the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations Co. told reporters.
“All the council and all the congress liked ... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it has experienced extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to take care of the restructuring of the federation.”
Cow said he also “liked” that Russia agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
“I think it was a very constructive day and that we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that now is not the time to restore Russia in rights,” he said.
“In the next few months, we have to do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the stained system,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, meeting the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations, will participate under a neutral flag in the World Championships in Athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements still have to be met to restore Russia.
As he told reporters in London after a report made on the council of the International Association of Athletics Federations, drug testing is still not carried out to a sufficient extent, and retired coaches are still quietly doing their job.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of state bribery
Detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), journalist Vasily Muravitsky was sent to arrest for two months, the SBU reports.
An employee of the online publication “Journal of Zhitomir” is suspected of state treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and in violation of the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the actions of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a “barbaric policy” against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The Borsini Commandant patrol ship entered Libya’s territorial waters to then, along with the country’s navy, stop the inflow of illegal migrants.
The decision to start the operation was taken by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which, however, does not control much of the country's territory.
The Libyan parliament, which opposes the cabinet and is based in Tobruk, has accused Italy of violating Libya’s sovereignty.
The commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to counter the Italian ships.
In Rome, however, said that they do not believe these threats and intend to send another warship into Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the European-recognised Libyan cabinet, Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities have set up a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after the publication of statistics on the number of illegals arriving in the country from Libya in July: 95,000 people since the beginning of the year.
The government said that resources for the reception of migrants had been exhausted.

Two leaders of the team of Ukraine in athletics suspended from participation in the World Cup
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povh, who specialize in short-distance running, are excluded from the Ukrainian team for the 2017 World Cup in London.
This is reported on the website of the Federation of Athletics of the country (FLAU).
This decision was taken by the executive committee of the organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings against athletes by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF).
Zemlyak coach Sergey Basenko was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
As reported by Sportarena, the IAAF suspects an athlete in the use of doping.
Povch is the bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championships, the 2010 European Champion in the 4 by 100 metres relay, Zemljak is the winner of the 2012 European Championships in the 4 by 400 metres relay.
The World Championships in Athletics in London will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How football’s financial rules will affect Neymar’s move to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent the world record-setting transfer of Neymar from Spain’s Barcelona to France’s Paris Saint-Germain.
Whatever the consequences may come further along the chain, for Paris Saint-Germain by UEFA, the governing body controlling European football, in whose power the teams are prohibited from participating in the prestigious Champions League tournament.
From the rules of financial fair play introduced by UEFA in 2011, it follows that PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar’s transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>222 million ($262 million) just to free the Brazilian from the contract, and Neymar will receive a complaint that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some financial aspects of Neymar’s move to France.
PSG can certainly afford to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team’s funding from Qatar’s energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums to acquire players, but they have to balance them at the expense of legitimate sources of income in order to reach the profitability threshold in their football business.
FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs that were in huge debt in their pursuit of success, in fact, cheated and risked ruin in the event that banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, FFP stopped focusing on club debts and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 – to buy a club with good potential, and then to seriously spend in order to improve the team and create a global brand – became a difficult plan.
During the current three-year evaluation period, which is exciting for 2018, clubs can suffer losses of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 million.
And despite the fact that Platini was removed from the presidency with shame in 2015, his UEFA successor Alexander Cheferin is still determined to contain excessive spending.
“Of course, the FFP is alive and we are moving forward and we will tighten the rules,” Andrea Traverso, who controls the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will pay for the redemption of Neymar’s contract at the same time, he can allocate this amount for reporting throughout the term of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer cost can be shown in the annual report as a cost of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG, as well as the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, were subjected to the most severe sanctions.
PSG was fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 million ($82 million at that rate), which was later reduced to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 million, and was ordered to limit its Champions League squad during the 2014-1015 season by a 21-player instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is tracking clubs that may try to outsmart its financial inspectorates by inflating their revenue at the expense of companies affiliated with the club’s owners.
Although the Qatari company could promote PSG, but if the amount of funding was considered to exceed standard market prices, UEFA would not allow it to be considered a legitimate income.
This is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA decided that the amount of funding for PSG from the Qatar Tourism Authority was inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar’s earnings in PSG could be received in the form of payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will be the ambassador of the World Cup, and such a maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
Past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more closely monitoring any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As reported on Thursday by people familiar with the situation, UEFA did not hold preliminary discussions with PSG about the transfer of Neymar.
They spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they were not authorized to discuss the situation of PSG.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016, PSG received more than 10 million euros in profit at a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The accounts for the last financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar’s arrival to be a favorable ground for sponsoring deals, selling attributes and team logo t-shirts.
The club expects turnover to grow by at least 30 percent as a result of hiring a new player.
Undaunted by the fact that one of the best players is leaving, the Spanish league tried to prevent Neymar’s transfer, saying that PSG would violate the financial “fair play”.
“This is an obvious case of financial doping, with the club and the state,” La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar as the ultimate owner of PSG.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports magnate, shares La Liga doubts about funding the club by the state.
"It's all a consequence of equity participation, and it has completely changed the landscape of football over the last fifteen years," Wenger said.
“When the club belongs to the country, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to comply with financial fair play, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and place of the oath shall be determined by the President.
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the President – such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law have been developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Building.
A week ago, the deputies planned to directly determine the procedure for swearing in the law.
Children under the age of 18 will be released from the solemn oath, as well as incapacitated, it follows from the revised text of the amendments to the bill "On the citizenship of the Russian Federation" (available "News"), which the committee will consider on July 11 before the second reading at its meeting.
President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of introducing the oath of citizenship of the Russian Federation instead of formal signing of documents on June 6 during a meeting with the State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
Deputies framed this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the draft law, which provides for the annulment of the decision on the extradition of citizenship of those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public calls to terrorism or its public authority.
According to the bill, his logic was this: by issuing citizenship documents, a person signs under the promise to comply with Russian legislation - he has embarked on the path of extremism, he violates this promise.
The bill was introduced in the State Duma in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasiliev ("United Russia"), Gennadiy Zyuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov ("Just Russia") and the speaker of DG Vyacheslav Volodin.
On 19 May, the deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the DG Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for second reading, but now it has been revised again.
Now it says that the procedure for swearing in the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation", indicating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn atmosphere in front of the state coat of arms and flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - the list of places where it is possible to place the coat of arms of the Russian Federation is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of state bodies of subjects, municipal entities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could have been the slugs.
To make a solemn oath those wishing to obtain citizenship of the Russian Federation will be after the officials check their documents.
But the Russian passport the person will receive only after he takes the oath, follows from the revised text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia will be sworn in from the age of 18, not from the age of 14.
A rule has remained that the oaths shall be released to the incapacitated or the incapacitated, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read or sign the text of the oath by hand.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to release from this procedure and "other persons",
Also, the updated draft law prescribes a special procedure for admission to Russian citizens of residents of Ukraine, who are considered to be speakers of the Russian language.
They will have to formally renounce Ukrainian citizenship by submitting a corresponding application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the statement will have to be handed over to Russian officials.
A waiver of “foreign” citizenship, as it is now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is not possible “for reasons beyond the control of the person”.
A corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, among them the first vice-speaker of DG Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Ayrat Farrakhov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is unrealistic, just impossible.
Accordingly, many people are waiting for the decision of their fate on the citizenship of the Russian Federation, - explained the head of the Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation Pavel Krasheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text clarified that restrictions on the occupation of certain positions for foreigners will not apply to those who have given up their “other” citizenship in writing and handed over their former passport to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs, but “for whatever reason” it has not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited from holding positions in the municipal service, being hired to work at facilities and in organizations whose activities are related to ensuring the security of Russia.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country cannot become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force from September 1, 2017, by which time the necessary by-laws should be prepared.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in "Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
The current iteration of the story nostalgically resembles both the glorious days of the characters in the 80s; the rad era of the grunge era in the 90s (about the time when the eminent masters David Wayne and Michael Schovalter made the comedy sketches "The State" for MTV, o, o, o).
As a fact of culture, it is simultaneously the elevation and embodiment of our era with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise she seems an anachronism.
“The first day of camp” was surprisingly good, and not just because of the absurdity of humor (including the original story about a talking bowl of vegetables voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result doubles the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually concerned children who have just reached adulthood; thus, the inability to return to become part of the joke.
“Ten years later,” where adults were already adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more systemless and includes riffs from 1990s stalker films like “Hand Swinging the Cradle.”
In one episode, the character gets the Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates and "a bunch of other things from 1991".
Many plot moves are the same.
The benevolent Coupe (Showalter), now a writer, still has not achieved reciprocity from Katy (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still has not parted with virginity.
And there is also a mad and vicious conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also a Showalter), who is now instigated by George Bush Sr. (a tried-and-tested parody of Michael John Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is retreating from it.
It’s especially fun to see the ever-young Rudd singing Matt Dillon’s song from The Lonely Ones, whose character, former big man Andy, now looks old-fashioned.
To bring this franchise success could be random insanity in the spirit of the recursive series "Seven Up" until it comes to what, in my opinion, would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American summer: twenty years later", where in the last scene the whole company would go to the movies.
“Comrade Detective” on the Amazon appeals to another type of nostalgia: memories of the Cold War from “Americans”, “Explosive Blonde” or even “Blind” with its images of the struggle of the East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Riz Thomas, depicts a television film: an 80s Romanian police drama about two Bucharest police officers fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist path.
The main roles - who saw the life of Gregor and the idealist Joseph - are performed by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelia Ulich, and their dialogues were voiced in English by Channing Tatum (he is the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are several visual jokes (policemen spend time watching a game of chess as Americans could watch football).
A team of famous voices behind the scenes - among them Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - allows you to play interestingly in the "guess the voice".
But Comrade Detective holds the credibility of a clumsy propaganda drama — there’s even a killer in Ronald Reagan’s mask — that often looks like it.
The six long episodes are lengthy, and it’s not very funny and not often.
If it were shorter, Comrade Detective could do better with his satire in the spirit of agitprop; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the U.S. Embassy, there are two fat people sitting in the lobby absorbing a bunch of hamburgers.
To an imaginary communist spectator, this image tells us that Western culture is capable of making an objiralovka out of anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with theirs too.
The prize fund of the match for the Russian Super Cup in football between Spartak and Lokomotiv will be about 30 million rubles.
This was announced by the President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL) Sergey Praddkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that so far there are almost no tickets left for the match.
The match "Spartak"- "Lokomotiv" will be held on Friday, July 14, at 21:30.
As TASS notes, "Spartak" is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and "Lokomotiv" is the owner of the country's Cup.
Two young ufimts cleaned the furniture shop for 200 thousand rubles
The other day, a 37-year-old Uffizi holder with a furniture company approached the police.
The man claimed to have stolen expensive tools from the shop, which caused serious damage to his production.
The production of steel tools with a total cost of almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding machines, a perforator, a hydraulics, a winch.
The guards of order began to search for criminals and soon came to the residents of the Blagoveshchensk district Bashkortostan, friends of 23 and 24 years.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the republic, accomplices penetrated into the territory of the enterprise, broke into the entrance door and removed the tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first hit auto service.
In relation to them, the case of theft has already been initiated, and the law enforcement officers managed to return only part of the stolen tools to the rightful owner.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words about the relations between Russia and the United States
The United States and Russia should be able to work with each other.
This statement was made by the official representative of the State Department Heather Nauert in response to the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev about the relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the United States put an end to the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared the Russian Federation a full-fledged trade war.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a "low level", but noted that "areas for interaction" should be sought.
“Look at the ceasefire in southwestern Syria, which has been observed for almost a month.”
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," the diplomat told RIA Novosti.
At the same time, the representative of the foreign policy department refused to comment on the statement of the Russian prime minister that the sanctions are equivalent to a trade war.
The bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and North Korea was signed by US President Donald Trump on Wednesday.
At the same time, he acknowledged that the document was unsuccessful and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "grown" roses from amethysts and quartz
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has added the collections Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
In them appeared five new rings and three choker rings on velvet ribbons.
In the Rose Dior Pré Catelan line, two new rings and a pendant made of amethysts, pink quartz and diamonds made in the technique of glyptics (hand carving on stone) and ferns and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house were released.
The head of Dior Joaillerie, Victor de Castellan, was inspired by the roses that Christian Dior, a fashion designer, grew in his estate in Granville, and the gardens of Bagatelle and Pre-Catelan in Paris.
Trump found the culprits of the deterioration of relations with Russia
U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply criticized members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions have led to a deterioration in relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an extremely low and dangerous level.
“You can thank Congress, these same people can’t even give us medicine,” the president tweeted.
The day before, Donald Trump signed a law on new sanctions against Russia, Iran and the DPRK.
In particular, they will affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House later issued a statement from the president in which he indicated that the law would not allow the United States to make profitable deals and would bring Russia, China and North Korea even closer together.
Belarusian entrepreneur refused to buy the Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
Belarusian entrepreneur Viktor Prokopenya withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) the application for the purchase of a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC with the intention “to focus on other of our planned investments and projects that we are working on”.
According to Mr. Prokopeni, this step will be “the best investment of time”, despite the investment attractiveness of buying Sberbank’s daughter.
Mr. Prokopenia became the main contender for the purchase of a unit of the Russian bank in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the application of the consortium NorvikBank Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Gutseriev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after the country’s president, Petro Poroshenko, imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One of these financial organizations - in addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank - became Sberbank.
Novak called the cause of the blackout in the Crimea
In the Ministry of energy of the Russian Federation called the cause of the blackout in the Crimea.
The head of the department Alexander Novak spoke with explanations about the incident.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a road accident on the territory of the Krasnodar Territory.
The truck caught in the accident blocked the power lines, as a result of which the Cuban and related Crimean networks were shut down.
Power outages in major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
Specialists removed the malfunctions within a few hours.
It was initially reported that the cause of the blackout could be abnormal heat.
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and easing inflation have forced rumours of a possible rise.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain subdued and has left interest rates unchanged amid growing pressure on family incomes.
Experts of the Bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted with a score of 6 against 2 for maintaining rates at 0.25%, with fewer committee members voting for the rate increase this month because weak economic growth weakened support for the increase.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to a rise of 1.7% percent in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes would continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to about 3% in the fall.
However, the bank warned that rate hikes in the next few years would be needed to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said borrowing costs would likely have to rise stronger than expected in financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted to abandon part of the massive set of economic development measures launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close its fixed-term financing plan, under which it provides banks with cheap loans, although he said he would now have to provide another <0xC2><0xA3>15 billion – up to <0xC2><0xA3>115 billion – as part of the plan.
In a statement, the bank said: “According to MPC’s main projections, gross domestic product (GDP) growth will remain slow in the near future, while pressure on real household incomes continues to affect consumption.”
On the issue of rates, he reiterated that in order to halt inflation, it will require “some tightening of financial policy” in a “slightly larger” size than markets expect.
At the moment, markets are predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases will be “gradual” and “limited.”
The bank’s forecasts for this and next year’s increase are lower than those made in May, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank left its forecast unchanged at 1.8% in 2018.
After this news, the sterling fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to USD 1.31 and by 0.4% to EUR 1.11.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent unsatisfactory growth indicators weakened the increased expectation of the increase; GDP then increased by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the representative of the bank, growth seems to remain at the level of 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will begin to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank’s latest inflation report gave little cause for joy to households, which were hit by high inflation and quite minor wage increases: according to the bank, the pressure will increase before it goes down.
The bank added that the financial policy “cannot prevent” a profit hike in the next few years, but expects wages to “significantly” recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of growing demand for British goods, driven by a low pound rate that offsets some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision came a year after last August’s rates were cut to 0.25% after the shocking results of a referendum on leaving the European Union led to a drop in the pound.
The bank estimates it will likely take four years to fully impact prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its latest rate decision, there was an increase in the noise around the supposed rate increase, as inflation pushed the already heavily pressured households: three members of the committee of experts asked to raise rates to 0.5% in July.
Last month, inflation fell to 2.6% from 2.9% in July, although, according to the bank, this fall was expected and will be compensated again in the coming months.
According to the bank, the higher figure compared to the planned 2% is entirely a consequence of the low rate of the pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of Mortgage Brokers Coreco, said: “If you take into account the recent drop in swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become even more competitive again as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good year to end.
The market looks particularly favorable for those approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with the possibility of no commission, as well as a low rate, becomes more popular than ever.
The State Health Service will prescribe a controversial drug against HIV 10000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to a “revolutionary” drug for HIV prevention after the battle in the High Court on the financing of the drug from the funds of the State Health Service.
The National Health Service of England has announced that pre-exposure HIV prevention (PREP), a pill taken before sex that has been proven to reduce the risk of infection in people at risk by an average of 86 percent, will now be provided by the health service for a trial period of 10 years.
She agreed to fund the trial after an appeals court upheld a High Court ruling last year that claimed the National Health Service had the ability to pay for PrEP, despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, which was announced on Thursday, was named “the most important innovation” by the president of England’s National Health Service, Simon Stevens, and the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) called it a “turning point.”
Prior to the full launch of the program across England by April 2018, venerological dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start registering people, and even more dispensaries will join the program in October.
Preexposure prevention (PREP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When taking PrEP before sex in the human body, a sufficient number of certain drugs to prevent infection with HIV infection.
Such drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients who are eligible to receive the drug include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people and people whose partners are HIV-positive and do not receive successful treatment.
Dispensers will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and individuals whose partners are not known whether their HIV status is withheld by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and assigned to a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venerological dispensary participating in the program.
The program will cost <0xC2><0xA3>10 million, and England’s National Health Service signed a drug supply agreement this week following an international procurement tender.
The study is designed to assess all the possibilities of pre-epilation through the collection of clinical data on who is the target audience of the drug, its absorption and its use on a large scale.
“This critical innovation should complement and strengthen the large-scale and increasingly successful efforts aimed at preventing HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in fighting one of the biggest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, President of NAT (National AIDS Control Authority), said: “This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PrEP, if properly targeted at people in need of help and at risk, provides an opportunity to change the situation with the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV, thanks to this study conducted in England at the expense of the National Health Service, will have access to a new, opening-up tool, the use of which a person can control himself without discussing it with a partner, which will lead to many improvements.
We warmly welcome this news.”
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: “The first thing we need to do now is to make sure that the test spreads quickly across the country and that no one in the HIV risk group is forgotten.
Now that we’re equipped with an experimental drug called PrEP, we’re going to protect more than 10,000 people who are at risk for HIV.”
Shadow Minister of Public Health Sharon Hodgson said: “We very much welcome the start of the PrEP trial, it is very late due to months of delays and delays by the government.”
The data demonstrates how revolutionary this drug can become as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending transmission of this deadly infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that the test be rolled out across the country as soon as possible to protect people at risk of HIV and to move us one step further towards ending the spread of HIV in society.
The World Congress of Tatars adopted a resolution on the support of the treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The Sixth Congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WCC) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of maintaining the post of president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "positively established form of organization of the highest state power in the republic and expressing the national interests of the entire Tatar people."
In addition, the Congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethnocultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole."
Since July 24, 2007, the agreement between Moscow and Kazan has been in force for 10 years.
On July 11, the deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia to extend the agreement and retain the title of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called the “president”.
In Russia, there are difficulties in obtaining international driver's license
The GIBDD units are experiencing a shortage of international driving licences (IDUs).
To get such rights, you have to wait a few weeks in a row, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go abroad on their car or rent it there.
It is worth noting that the situation with international driver's licenses remains controversial.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs was introduced in order to make it easier for foreign police to understand what is written in the national certificate, since the information in it is explained in five languages.
The requirements for international law are enshrined in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized and so on.
However, in reality, it all depends on the specific police or rental office: some require the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and some have enough national rights.
To insure themselves, drivers of international rights still receive, but it should be borne in mind that in countries that have not ratified the convention (for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Now there is a problem with forms in almost all units of the BIDD, reports Kommersant, conducting a study in a number of regions.
So, in Moscow, in the units of UGIBDD, coupons are simply not issued, blanks have been missing for four months.
You can register for the reception on the website of state services, but there the turn has already stretched to the middle of August.
In Krasnoyarsk, the Ministry of Internal Affairs cannot be obtained "for technical reasons", without going into detail, in the Samara region it is honestly said that there are no forms, a similar situation occurs in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, such messages are increasingly appearing on social networks:
Irina Burmistrova: “Guess why you can’t get international rights in Moscow?”
That's right, because in all the departments of the BIBDD, the forms were finished.
Elena Podkolzina: "Question to knowledgeable people!"
We need to get international rights very urgently.
In Moscow all the time is far ahead, on the spot coupons are not issued at all (there is a button, but the coupon can not give).
It seems that the portal of state services shows that in SPB time is free to the fig.
Did anyone try to get in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for forms of international driving licenses have changed, therefore, new forms are being delivered to the departments of the State Autoinspection.
This may be related to the deficit, however, it is not clear what changes are involved, it has not been previously reported.
Forms are purchased by the Special Purpose Center for Road Traffic Safety (TSN BDD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then delivered to GIBDD units.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with Goznak JSC: in 2014-2015, almost 200 thousand forms of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were produced, in 2016 15 thousand forms were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with LLC "First printing yard" for the manufacture of 70.
There is a version that the CSN simply did not have time to hold the tender in time, which led to a deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to travel independently not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand and so on.
What rights are accepted there, to the end it is unclear, so people are reinsured, and therefore there is an exciting demand for international "steps".
Recently it became known that professional drivers will have to pass the exam to confirm their qualifications.
This was the proposal made by the Ministry of Transport.
The International Driver's License (IPL) of the new model has been in effect since 31 May 2011.
Minister of Justice of Ukraine refused to believe in the construction of the Crimean bridge
Ukraine’s Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko said he did not believe in Russia’s ability to build a bridge to Crimea.
About it on Friday, August 4, he said in an interview with the portal "Obzrevatel".
No self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or a nut there, because it risks losing its business on the territory of the EU, the United States, Japan – in countries that have joined sanctions against Russia regarding Crimea.
"That is, in my deep conviction, the prospects of this project are actually not there," Petrenko said.
He added that he believes Russia is unable to implement a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build smaller-scale facilities.
I know that after the Olympics in Sochi, whole stadiums have already begun to collapse.
“Therefore, I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so short-sighted to join this project,” the official said.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the arch of the Crimean bridge.
On the Kerch coast, an extensive assemblage of the Crimean Bridge road arch has been completed: its vault will be closed at an altitude of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
“At the same time, the bridge builders have prepared for installation on the railing supports of the railway arch,” the information center of the project said.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport Maxim Sokolov informed the President of Russia Vladimir Putin that the construction of the object is ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean peninsula and the Krasnodar Krai.
In Spain fired an official who did not go to work for 10 years
What kind of angelic patience (or absolute indifference to public service) should the chief of the Spanish official Carlos Resio have?
The permanent walk lasted for 10 long years.
However, Mr. Resio was dismissed.
But not your immediate boss.
This is not the case in the world of bureaucrats.
The people seem to have long been accustomed to all the jokes of the "servants of the people".
And yet, officials are always able to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time the "sensation" complained from Spain.
There, an employee of the Valencian Archives, Carlos Resio, managed to stay out of work for ten years.
He received a complaint on a regular basis.
And all solid - 50 thousand euros per year.
And now Mr. Resio's "strange times" are over.
He was dismissed by the decision of the Legislative Assembly of Valencia.
During the investigation, it turned out that an angry walker came to the office every working morning at 7 a.m. to mark himself in the electronic system.
And then I went home.
Once again he appeared at the workplace at 4:00 p.m. to again note in the system that he had left.
10 years.
It also became known that all leisure time the walker devoted to drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the Valencia legislative assembly are thinking how to punish and direct the boss Mr. Resio, who could not help but know how to "actively work" in his workplace his subordinate.
Judges offer protection from presidents
The Presidential Human Rights Council (HRC) on behalf of Vladimir Putin has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The SHRC proposes to limit the powers of the presiding officers of the courts and to introduce their discretion.
For the courts of appeal and cassation instance, the SPC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court should also present its proposals in the framework of the presidential mandate.
The HRH has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of Russian justice.
This work was carried out by the HRH on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the President gave after meeting with the members of the Council.
At the meeting with the members of the council on December 8, 2016, discussed, among other things, individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as the problems of public control in the places of detention of citizens (see "<0xD0><0x9A>" of December 9).
The result of the work of the HRH was 25 proposals, which concern both the issues of ensuring the independence of judges and the detection of judicial errors, as well as the financing of courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of Kremlin human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the court presidents to increase the independence of other judges.
If the candidate for the post of judge has successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judicial community, then the president of the court, in the opinion of the HRH, must submit it to the appointment, without having the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to distribute cases for consideration among judges.
To do this, experts admit, can be a specially written computer program.
Also, the HRH believes that the chairman is not entitled to "predetermine the results of the qualification certification of the judge, initiate his involvement in disciplinary responsibility, make decisions on the establishment of additional material payments."
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to "the election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves" and "give them powers for a relatively short period with mandatory rotation".
Now all the presidents of the courts (from republican to district) are appointed for six years by the president at the presentation of the president of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the HRH proposes to re-organise appeals and cassation in courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRH says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of individual courts of appeal and cassation not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, but in the judicial districts."
Experts take as a basis the practice of arbitration courts.
There are "court districts" that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but guarantee a greater independence from regional officials, who find it difficult to use "telephone law".
The World Court of Human Rights proposes to strengthen the participation of people’s judges to consider certain “categories of civil and administrative cases”.
For example, on the deprivation of parental rights, on the restoration to work, on the protection of honor and dignity, on the deprivation of driving rights, etc.
"These are only our proposals," said the member of the HHRC, a judge of the Constitutional Court in the resignation of Tamar Morshchakov.
She also recalled that the mandate of the President concerned not only the HRH, but also the Supreme Court (SC), which had not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time to fulfill the order at the Armed Forces (among the co-executors - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation).
To report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is ensured in Russia, the Chairman of the Armed Forces Vyacheslav Lebedev must until September 1.
Living a high life: a half-story and clever design techniques turned this small apartment in Earls Court into a spacious apartment
Joan Lee, a former real estate banker, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is located on the first floor of a nice typical house in the style of Queen Anne, and in favor of the new design says that Joan did not collect her things and did not move again.
“I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger square,” Joan says.
“I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered her a price the same day.”
Since the first viewing, the apartment with an area of 1000 square feet has undergone a complete reconstruction.
Originally it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complicated layout – to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen – and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a half-floor to squeeze the maximum benefit out of the generous height of the ceilings.
“I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands,” she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill’s Duck & Shed architectural and design studio to use the 12.5-foot-tall ceilings to create a home that would not only be a successful project, but would suit Joan’s life.
The ceiling was not high enough to arrange two rooms one above the other, so the architectural task was to create a half-story where one could stand in full height.
Erfan had to think creatively to deal with the brief.
“Working with steel structures is very difficult,” he explains.
“We had to arrange the rooms so that they were one above the other, and we didn’t have to bend.
It was necessary not just to build a simple platform, but to bend the structures so that they were at the right height and allowed to use the premises from above and below.”
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-sized rooms one above the other in a dedicated space – and much more interesting.
From the half-floor through a vintage copper light window from Retrouvius opens a view of the chic living room at the bottom.
Mirror furniture with gold finish, silver accents and vintage lighting fixtures from Serge Muy set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacle, space, and light.
A short corridor is framed by mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, a mirrored protective panel appears as a window to another room.
At the entrance, mirror cabinets are used to store all Joan's dishes.
To create a feeling of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can fence the kitchen when not in use.
There is nothing new in the kitchen.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a moving up door, as in a garage.
“Engineering art was involved here,” Erfan told about the reinforced steel of the wooden-fiber shield door.
“It’s equipped with a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.”
Thanks to the reasonable use of space and storage space, Joan received an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and improved layout.
“Ultimately, the floor area is exactly what you’re going to sell, that is, what your property is valued for,” Erfan says.
“Roughly speaking, a real estate agent will come in and make calculations based on the floor area.”
Here they were able to increase the area of the floors, using quality materials that give the space a touch of luxury.
“Materials are what we touch, so they help to create an emotional connection with the home,” says Erfan.
“No one falls in love with the wiring in the walls.
It’s important, but it doesn’t hurt the strings of our hearts.”
This serves as evidence that due to good design and increased metering, an apartment can turn from something ordinary into something amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you can decide to stay.
The Government has approved the establishment of a Commission on Cultural Policy
The Russian government has approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The relevant decree was published on the government’s website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft cultural policy strategies, clarify the objectives and prepare new programmes for their implementation.
The head of the commission was appointed Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation.
The composition of the commission will be approved separately.
In 2016, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev approved a plan for the implementation of the strategy of the state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 events and includes measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve a common cultural space and cultural heritage, and will also contribute to creating conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in the G20 countries has fallen to an eight-year low
Consumer price growth in the G20 countries has fallen to its lowest level in eight years, according to the Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).
According to OECD estimates, inflation rates in June 2016 were 2% – lower values were noted in October 2009, when the price growth index reached 1.7%.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a decrease in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been reached - according to this department, the figure is 4%.
Putin warns against illegal slicing of Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin during the meeting on environmental development of the natural Baikal territory warned against the illegal destruction of forests.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donskoy noted that a draft law had been prepared earlier.
It allows the clearing of forests during the elimination of fires, and the government plans to adopt it in the autumn.
In turn, the president said that this project should be monitored so that in the process of cutting "not all in a row".
Donskoy noted that this bill involves control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and supervisory agencies.
Media: VSU fighters secretly from the command agree with the militias of the Donbass
On the line of armed confrontation in the Donbass, regular telephone communication was established.
Fighters of the opposing sides constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is not known in the headquarters.
The fighters of the Armed Forces and the militias of the Donbass have established communication on cell phones secretly from their high command.
This is reported on August 4, "Strana.ua" with reference to the participants of the military operation in the Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know perfectly well the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by telephone.
Communication is not at all domestic: commanders are trying to reach some "tactical arrangements".
Often the result of such talks is a truce on a certain section of the front.
Journalists became aware of cases when congratulations on the birthday of an officer received because of the front line, from his formal enemy.
Fighters of the Armed Forces and militias of the DPR and LPR have been in the trenches on the line of demarcation since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine began a combat operation against the Donbass.
The Foreign Ministry outraged the blocking of the statements of the UN Security Council on the attacks on the Russian Embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of some Western diplomatic representatives who block statements by the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist attacks by the Russian embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry recalled that the territory of the Russian embassy in Damascus on August 2, for the third time in a month was subjected to mortar fire by terrorist groups "Heyat Tahrir al-Sham" (former "Jabhat al-Nusra", banned in the Russian Federation) and "Fileq Ar-Rah".
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in the qualification of "Nusra" as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for countering this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem, of course, that the terrorist attacks "Nusra" must meet universal unconditional and resolute disapproval.
However, as the Russian Foreign Ministry stressed, "for the third time in a month diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine presented to the UN Security Council, alternately, varying the tone of the objections, hiding the arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to accept the draft resolution with a standard summary.
The reluctance to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain with those delegations.
"The most disturbing thing is that the Security Council's inability to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to new provocations and terrorist attacks, gives them a sense of impunity," the Foreign Ministry said, adding that "it would not be desirable for these barbarians to create a conviction that something is wrong with the Council."
Vladimir Putin advocated limiting the number of unplanned business inspections
During the meeting on investment projects in the Far East, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the number of unplanned inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the planned number, and also said the need to limit the period of inspections to ten days.
“Unplanned inspections are usually carried out without proper agreement with the prosecutor’s office; only 2-3% agree with the prosecutor’s office, everything else goes on its own,” – quotes the President of TASS.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be banned from taking out servers and hard drives at enterprises.
In addition, according to the president, business associations should be given the right to protect the interests of their members in court.
"This, I hope, will bring a certain positive to the consideration of cases related to business activities or related to the violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
As reported by "U", due to the action of the moratorium on carrying out planned inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is growing.
In May, according to the order of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, 15.5% of the respondents conducted a survey, as a result of which it turned out that in fact, the planned inspections were replaced by unplanned ones (the share of those faced with them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), the prosecutors (from 16.9% to 13% in 2016), the prosecutors (from 7.9% to 21.8% in 2016), the respondents, the respondents (from 7.

The brothers are fighting for a real estate empire worth more than $500 million.
The two brothers are fighting for one of the largest empires in the state of Victoria in a real estate trade worth more than $500 million – forty years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and developer Colin de Lutes lives in Turac Palace through three doors from his younger brother Paul, who filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court over the division of possessions and assets.
Paul wants to leave the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still in a heated dispute over the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars bought since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a network of 160 retail outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutys family’s list of possessions today includes office buildings, construction sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, Gold Coast apartments and Mount Buller, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
By arrangement with his late father, Colin, whom Paul describes as the "leading driving force and dominating personality" of the De Lutys family, owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul owns about one-third.
According to the court, this means that Colin owns 316 million and Paul owns 176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
“The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property,” he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several unsuccessful attempts at reconciliation, the first hearings in the Supreme Court took place.
The brothers are now arguing over who will control the existing business - from which, according to Paul, Colin excluded him.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some facilities.
In testimony given by Colin at the beginning of the trial, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian roots make me consider the family a top priority,” he wrote.
The court costs are rising like a snowball: hundreds of pages of depositions, emails and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer have been added to the case; both sides have attracted the best-known lawyers, including the royal lawyer Allan Myers, and the best uncles.
Mrs. De Lutes and her late husband Luigi were immigrants from Italy; from the late 1950s they ran milk bars and gastronomes, and in the early 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
Under financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened his first family-owned jeans store.
Colin says he launched Westco when he was “in the last grades of school, and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old) at the time.”
Anna De Lutis says that they and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to hand over their possessions to their sons without conflict.
“Luiji often told me that he didn’t want the brothers to be tried in court,” she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutys group of companies; Colina says that Mark received $10 million when he left the business and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were “dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their office.”
Colin was not a public figure, though he was a former member of the AFL club board of directors and, according to Eddie McGee’s 2015 biography, the TV star’s best friend.
Fairfax Media on Friday contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers.
Colin only replied with a text message that, since the case had not yet been heard in court, "I really have nothing to say."
“I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to file a lawsuit against me and to shake the name of our family in court,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in his testimony that he was trying to satisfy his brother’s demands.
“Our father would not like to see us arguing in court,” he said, adding that he “still hopes to resolve the conflict.”
On Friday, that hope seems to have dissipated.
“The decision on our case will soon be made by the court,” Colin wrote.
The new head of the Trump apparatus plans to limit the receipt of information to the president.
Others tried to do so and were defeated.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.
In that case, he will be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information coming to President Trump, including news reports from the media, in hopes of keeping the chief in a more calm state.
This is reported by reporter Josh Dozzi.
“At a meeting held by the new White House Chief of Staff John F. Kelly with the White House leadership on his first working day, he outlined the main problem at the White House under President Donald Trump that he hopes to solve: bad channels of getting information to the president.”
Kelly told employees that the information should go through him — in paper form or through briefings — because the president would be better off making decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly’s diagnosis is perfectly true, but others have already failed to try to appease Trump by tracking his information.
President Trump’s relationship with television developed decades ago — and now that he’s in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
“When Trump, as a candidate, was outraged by the unfair coverage of the campaign, it was helpful to demonstrate to him that he was getting fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded,” Sam Nanberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmery wrote in Politico that “according to six former members of the electoral staff, in order to keep Trump’s habit of writing on Twitter under control, it was necessary to make sure that the information coming to him personally was a constant stream of praise.”
All right.
But the idea that Trump’s habit of tweeting has ever been “under control” is just ridiculous.
Maybe these election staffers know something we don’t — for example, that if it weren’t for them, Trump’s tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets that Trump has not posted.
If his employees saved him from trouble at least several times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has always managed to keep Trump from pouring oil into the fire.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving Trump material — reliable or not — that confirms their views.
"Politics" - just to this story - wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly feed the president dubious information.
Here is an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
“Current and former Trump employees say Trump can react very sharply to negative press reports, especially containing dangerous leaks, and will not calm down until he finds out who was behind them.
That’s what happened in late February, when someone pushed the president to print an article with GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, in which the deputy head of the apparatus Kathy Welsh was accused of being “behind a number of leaks” in the White House.
It doesn’t matter that Johnson is forever banned on Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he didn’t present specific facts, or that in the past he launched false accusations and then turned them down.
Trump read the article and started asking employees about Wales.
Goldmacher adds that then-head of the apparatus Raines Pribus and Secretary of the apparatus Rob Porter “tried to build a system to manage the flow of papers that Trump receives and document them.”
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly is trying to do the same thing.
Perhaps he will be a more effective manager than Pribus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature, and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly’s task very difficult.
Tyumen Prosecutor’s Office Fights HIV Dissident
The prosecutor's office challenged the decision of the Kalinin Rysuda Tyumen, which terminated the criminal case against a local resident who had a minor daughter who died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died due to the fact that the mother is an HIV-dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court acquitted her of the responsibility for reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecution believes that the crime cannot be left unpunished so as not to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against Tyumen resident was initiated under part 1 of Article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (cause of death due to carelessness) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection stage 4B.
According to the prosecutor’s office, the mother herself is HIV-infected.
“The woman was not treated on her own and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist,” the prosecutor’s office of the Tyumen region explained.
The criminal case was brought in the Kalinin District Court of Tyumen, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
The petition was filed by the father of the deceased girl, explaining that "he forgave his wife, has no claims to her, she smoothed the damage and brought an apology."
The Prosecutor ' s Office disagreed with the court ' s decision and appealed, demanding that the decision to close the case be overturned and re-examined.
The girl died, and it is impossible to smooth out the damage caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother, contrary to the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her from a dangerous infection, "- said in the press service of the prosecutor's office.
According to the supervisory authority, she should be punished, otherwise her example would be followed by other HIV-dissidents.
As told in the Tyumen AIDS Center, now in the Tyumen region about 12 children suffering from HIV do not receive medical care due to the refusal of parents.
"And this situation has already improved - during the year of work of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat children with HIV, changed their opinion - allowed to make a diagnosis, began to take drugs," said Elena Loseva, a spokeswoman for the AIDS Center.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents in a legislative way, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children can be detected - mothers do not allow them to be examined, hide, run away with children from hospitals.
What Are the Dangers of HIV Dissidents?
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of the first study in Russia of the so-called movement of HIV-dissidents.
HIV-dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and activists of AIDS-service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and in their distribution see a serious threat.
An ugly photo session, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Grechany railway station in Khmelnytsky.
A cheerful company of drunken young people walked on a bridge over the railway tracks, where a freight train was just standing.
One of the friends had the idea to make an effective selfie on the roof of the car, told FACTAM in the police communication sector in the Khmelnytsky region.
The boy began to descend from the bridge to the train, but due to his carelessness he got stuck behind the power line and immediately received a shock current.
Fortunately, this case became known to the station manager, who immediately called an "emergency".
Before the arrival of the doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of the Khmelnytsky Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with burns of the torso 1 - 2 degrees.
His condition is now assessed by doctors as stable.
Law enforcement officials recall that in recent times, extreme selfies on the roofs of multi-storey buildings, bridges, moving transport have become increasingly popular.
Police are urging people to be vigilant and not to allow such photo sessions, especially among children and adolescents.

In ancient Venus, there could be oceans.
This is what French scientists have suggested.
Experts have created a computer model that demonstrated the process of water formation on the surface of planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that at the beginning of its history, Venus formed oceans in which there was 10% more water than now on Earth.
Earlier, the Arguments of the Week wrote that, according to the hypothesis of scientists, the ocean could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign experts in the course of their research came to the conclusion that the water object was located on the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.

rock band Louna will present a new album in Barnaul
Louna's concert will take place in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album "The Strange New World", which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The group is preparing a conceptual show that will become the most vivid in the band’s concert history.
"Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is associated with the famous novel-anti-utopia O. Huxley "On a strange new world".
The new songs do not retell the book, but tell about a society that lives by the law of anti-utopia, "blind faith in propaganda and imposed values."
To raise money for the recording of the album the group was helped by listeners: on the website "Planeta.ru" the project was supported by more than 1200 people.
Louna released her first album "Make It Loud!" in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians presented the album "Time X", and in 2013 they recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, Louna performed with a symphony orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the Song of Peace program.
The band consists of Lusine Gevorkian (vocals), Vitaliy Demidenko (bass guitar), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergey Ponkratiev (guitar), Leonid Kinzbursky (barabana).
The concert will take place in the Barnaul club "Pharaoh" on October 17 at 19.00.
Ticket price: from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the most sought-after bands on the Russian rock scene.
The group was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The band has won several times in different nominations of the hit parade "Dirty Dozen".
The Gypsies have crossed the trenches and returned to the “street of millionaires”
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again in conflict with the determined Gypsies, who have overcome the pits dug by the municipal authorities to retake the field near their homes.
The gypsies parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering the rich Solihalla street, which was jokingly called “the millionaire street.”
Bringing with them horses, infants, and many houses on wheels, they returned after they were driven no further than in May, and they were not hindered by the ditches dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a gap in the defenses and pushed their vehicles through a section that was left unfenced to leave room for the path.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihall, saying it was "unable to solve this problem".
An anonymous local resident said: “They came here on the evening of Monday after they were expelled from Bentley Heath, where they threw stones at passers-by.”
The municipality should be ashamed and forced to act, because they are completely unable to solve this problem.
The Gypsies were here in May, they were banished, and here they are again.
Last night, more Gypsies came, and today, perhaps, more.
“Birmingham Municipality knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks,” she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don’t like that I keep paying the municipal tax, and the municipality can’t even put an end to it.”
One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: “It’s funny, we just saw these Gypsies leave the previous time, and here, please, this attack continues.”
This time there were more of them, and we even saw a horse grazing on the meadow.”
A spokesman for Solihall said: “We are aware of the illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and are cooperating with Solihall police; we are taking the necessary legal action to expel them as soon as possible.”
To help us collect evidence, it is very important that as many locals as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police by phone 101.
This gives us an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea activates the factory of champagne wines "New World"
GUP of the Republic of Crimea "The Factory of Champagne Wines "New World"" decided to act, transforming into JSC "The Factory of Champagne Wines "New World"", follows from the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea Anna Anyukhina.
100% of the company’s shares will remain in state ownership of Crimea.
The authorized capital of the joint-stock company will be 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5,955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of the Crimea has stated that if there are no funds for the modernization of the plant in the next three years, there will be a threat of a plant shutdown.
Exploitation of fixed assets at the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion rubles. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the budget income.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
“Getting money from the owner is problematic, talking about borrowing funds of large credit organizations is difficult,” Deputy Head of the Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea Sergey Petelin said in April this year.
The Parliament of Crimea included the enterprise in the forecast privatization plan for 2017.
It was proposed to hold its shareholding and to put it up for auction.
The source of "Interfax" in the authorities of the Crimea estimated the possible cost of the sale of the enterprise at $ 40 million, the investor's investment in modernization - another $ 30 million.
“New World” in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 – to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, “New Light” planned to release 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was founded in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn as a factory for the production of sparkling wine in his acquired estate Novyi Svet.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third graders have destroyed more than 40 gravestones
The employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Nizhny Novgorod region established the identities of citizens who destroyed 46 graves in the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The attackers were third-grade students.
The first statement that the gravestones were damaged by unknown, came to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Lyskov district on June 27.
In total, 24 people have turned to the police for this reason.
As a result, a criminal case under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Destruction, damage or desecration of burial places" was initiated.
As a result of the investigation, the police identified the suspects, they were two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing the monuments fall, and this prompted them to act in a hooligan way.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone with regard to NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs owned by rescue vessels in the Mediterranean Sea that they will not be able to continue their work unless they comply with the new rules governing their activities.
“If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities,” Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily newspaper Stampa.
Minniti’s warning came a day after Italian authorities confiscated a ship owned by German humanitarian organisation Jugend Rettet, on suspicion that its crew was in fact cooperating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has worked for only a year, has refused to comment on the merits of the detailed charges brought against it by the Italian prosecutor Ambrose Cartosio.
“For us, saving human life is and will remain a top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot now continue to operate in the search and rescue zone,” the organization said in a statement.
“We will only be able to assess all the allegations made now after we have gathered all the information and been able to assess the situation.”
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the Juventa vessel, owned by Jugend Rettet, since October.
His crew is suspected of having taken migrants on board with whole lifeboats, which were sent directly to them by human traffickers, and allowed smugglers to leave along with boats that they could use again.
At least one such meeting is supposed to have taken place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the indictments, the content of which was published in the Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the orders of the Italian coast authorities, which control the rescue operations in the area, rather from a humanitarian point of view than for any other reason.
The code of conduct assumes, mainly, that Juvenile ships will have on board an Italian police officer who will monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code: “Save the Children”, the Maltese MOAS and “Pro-Activa Expanded Embrace” from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable on the condition that they would not involve any "significant changes or interference" with its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
“In recent days, we have started to see the light at the end of the tunnel,” the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
“In Libya, we don’t want to be associated with either side of the conflict.”
The Russian authorities have recently significantly intensified their policy on the Libyan direction, and with visits to Moscow, delegations of opposing Libyan parties attended.
The head of the Russian contact group on the intra-Lithuanian settlement under the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma, the assistant to the head of the Chechen Republic Lev Dengov told “U”, what goals Moscow pursues in this region and who it is betting on.
Almost nothing is known about the Libya contact group you are leading.
Here, let's say, the contact group on Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
Here is the veil of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what goals do you pursue?
The contact group was established at the initiative of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Deputy of the Duma from Chechnya.
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the creation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker "Mehanik Chebotarev" (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board.
We thought about how to help the crew.
Then a contact group of military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, was created, our work was supported by the head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov.
How did you manage to lead it?
Since I have been working in Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the group.
Our activity was not limited to the liberation of sailors from the "Mechanics of Chebotarev".
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all the main groups opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - and from Tripoli (where the recognized UN government led by Faiz Sarraj is based - "the"), and with Tobruk (the residence of the parliament that opposes the government and supports Marshal Haftali).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (Vice-Prime Minister of Libya - "<0xD0><0x9A>"), we were able to quickly agree on the release of Russian sailors.
Then it was decided to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to be associated with either side of the conflict, we are in dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
There are now five people in the contact group.
Among them are people who have experience working in power structures, including in the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to introduce to the group of specialists by region, representatives of the Institute of the Middle East RAS.
No one is permanently in Libya from our staff, there is no need for this yet.
Is there now in Libya Russian military advisers, instructors.
And if so, whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All the conversations and publications about this are not true.
But in your contact group, former military personnel are...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or cities such as Misurata (where militia units are based, which played a role in the ousting of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and significantly intensified in subsequent years) are closed to us.
We arrived in Missouri in January of this year.
We were scared, told that there were all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are such rumors, what is the role of Islamists there.
In Misurata, we met with all the representatives of the detachments that were engaged in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was taken away from the militants of the banned in Russia "Islamic State" - "U").
We wanted to see them, to get to know these people, to check the information that they were the ones who played a decisive role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, and not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these merits to himself.
And what conclusion did you come to?
Has not the Islamic State in Libya defeated Haftar?
He didn't do that.
Haftar was conducting operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And the IS in Sirte were fought by structures that obeyed the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited to Russia people who carried out this anti-terrorist operation.
And they came - the visit was extended from 19 to 23 April this year, the Libyan delegation was accepted in the Council of the Federation, in the Duma, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Rosgvardia.
You, as we understand, are in all Libyan regions and probably imagine the moods of local elites and field commanders.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the ceasefire agreements, the elections that Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj reached at the end of July in Paris?
Or again, as has happened many times in the past, agreements will be broken, hostilities will resume, the parties will try to seize power alone?
For us, a good signal was the fact that Saraj and Haftar agreed to another meeting, not so long ago it was impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
As for Russia's position...
They often write and say that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe in it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misurata, and Haftar was on board the Russian aircraft carrier “Admiral Kuznetsov” that day.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misurata, they did not believe in coincidence.
We were told, “You must be very brave people who came to us today.”
But our task is to show that we are not only supporting Haftar, we are engaging in dialogue with all key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar have been in contact.
Does mutual understanding with Russian partners on a human, emotional level facilitate the fact that he studied twice in the USSR?
And, by the way, does Haftar know Russian?
If he knows Russian, it is very relative.
But what he has learned from us, of course, facilitates dialogue with him.
And not just with him, by the way.
When we communicate with the military in Tripoli and Misurata, we meet generals who have studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And they speak Russian very well.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent they are nostalgic for it.
Do you think that an immediate lifting of the arms embargo imposed on Libya is likely?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in the supply of Russian weapons?
They are interested, of course, but, as I have already said, we do not take sides in this conflict and would not like to arm one at the expense of the other.
We would like everyone to be on an equal footing.
As for the arms embargo, there are constant calls from the Libyans for Russia to somehow facilitate its removal.
The process of drafting a constitution is now being actively promoted in Libya.
We hope that the parties will come to compromise decisions, will reach an internal consensus.
Then the elections should be held, which was also mentioned at the meeting of Saraj and Haftar.
If the elections are held and the legitimate power is finally elected (and now neither side has such a status), then the question of lifting the arms embargo can be put in the UN Security Council.
To raise this issue now is pointless and dangerous, it will only lead to an escalation of the conflict.
The other day, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees floating from Libya, feels left to chance by its EU allies.
In this situation, can Moscow help Italian partners by using its links with Libyans?
How realistic is it, for example, that Haftar’s troops will establish control over the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers transporting immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need Russia’s support because Moscow is in dialogue with both Haftar and Saraj, Misurata and the south of the country.
And in this issue, the tribes in southern Libya play a big role, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about the Southerners cutting off the flow of migrants on long-distance approaches?
That is, conditionally speaking, were the buses that Nigerian migrants are travelling on were turned back?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to help unite the South in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes of the South.
But first, we would like to see unity of opinion on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
The head of government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist, a supporter of the introduction of Sharia law in the country.
How many radical views does he hold?
Will this not be an obstacle in building relations with Russia or the West?
I will give my personal opinion about him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But there are Islamists in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Libya should be an absolutely normal country – moderately Islamic, open to the world.
He is also actively fighting terrorists.
Why does he have such a reputation?
It was created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, where there is legislative, executive and judicial power.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank and other state structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in us not going there.
And we mixed them all the cards and began to actively communicate with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the fruits of this work: Rosneft has concluded an agreement on cooperation with the state oil company of Libya - NOC.
The director of NOC Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosneft’s head Igor Sechin concluded the deal, himself directly from Tripoli.
Two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with it?
I think it's resold.
What are Russia’s economic interests in Libya?
The plans include re-signing contracts signed under Muammar Gaddafi.
We are talking, in particular, about previous agreements in the field of transport (railway construction), energy (electricity) and a number of others.
Do Libyans have anything to pay for?
Well, they have oil.
That is, as in the case of Iran, it is a scheme "oil in exchange for services"?
I do not know what the scheme will be, I do not directly deal with these issues.
In fact, the economy for Russia in Libya is not the main thing.
We are, in fact, engaged in peacemaking.
For us, the main thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans to agree among themselves so that they can establish order and Libya cease to be a favorable environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task – to help the Libyan people and to extort terrorists from there.
Do you have data on the presence in Libya (now or earlier) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that to date no one from Russia and other countries of the former USSR is there.
He said he had about 50,000 phone records of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya - "U") and Russian speech does not sound there.
What kind of countries are these fighters from?
I don’t want to go into those details.
Then we will formulate the question differently.
How many of the Islamist militants in Libya are Libyans themselves?
There are practically no Libyans among them, they are no more than 5%.
The rest are newcomers.
Can Moscow hold internal negotiations on the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have declared their readiness to come again - to Moscow or to Grozny.
When can such negotiations take place?
It's hard to say now.
There are still several visits to be made, and then, I hope, there will be clarity about the time and place of the negotiations.
In the Czech Museum, the philanthropists raised money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
In the sub-Moscow museum-reserve "Melikhovo" nine-year-old boy Sasha Macola, who has cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus and complete blindness, on August 5 will receive as a gift a specialized treadmill.
A useful presentation will be presented by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow Region Oksana Kosarev and the Director of the Museum Konstantin Bobkov.
The money for the trainer was collected during the charity marathon “Don’t get tired of doing good”, which took place in Melikhov on July 15 on Chekhov’s Day of Remembrance.
On the eve of the marathon in the museum received from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino Chekhov district, a letter: "I have no eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
“I’d really like to get a treadmill as a gift so that my legs would be strong and I’d learn to walk a little bit.”
And now Sasha's dream has come true!
After the presentation in the museum-reserve will be held "Concert-postscriptum" - a famous pianist, honored artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform popurri from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melikhove performed a choir of Voznesensk Davydova Desert, bellmen of the workshop of Ilya Drozdykhin, students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Academy named after Gnessin, artists of the Melikhovo Theatre "Chekhovskaya Studio".
Auctions were held for visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenir products with the logo of the marathon were organized.
Museum-reserve "Melikhovo" took the initiative to make Chekhov Day of Remembrance on July 15 a single day of charity in all museums of the Moscow region.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk Zhytomyr region near the local football stadium shot several times in the direction of teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, reported "FACTS" in the communication department of the police of the Zhytomyr region.
After that, the man went to a cafe nearby.
In the building he had a conflict, during which a man used a device to shoot rubber bullets, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim was provided with the necessary medical care, there is no threat to his life.
Police and ambulance arrived at the scene, but the shooter had fled by this time.
Law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He has seized a device for firing rubber bullets, which has been sent for examination.
According to this fact, criminal proceedings under Article 296 (huliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine have been initiated.
The detainee is threatened with imprisonment for a period of 3 to 7 years.
Recall that in Kiev on Lukyanovka in the area of Tatarskaya Street on the night of July 28, there was an attack with a gun.
Michelle Carter Sentenced for Instigating Conrad Roy's Suicide
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for inciting her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide by texting and making phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20 years old, will have to serve 15 months of her term in jail and another 5 years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the involuntary manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father said in a hearing on Thursday: “My family was killed by grief.
My son was my best friend.”
Carter was allowed to remain at large until the appeal.
She was threatened with a maximum term of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, wearing red pants and a cream blouse, listened to the sentence standing, clasping his hands and lowering his eyes.
“She killed Conrad Roy with her actions,” the prosecutor told the court.
“She interrupted his life to improve hers.
She did not accept responsibility,” she said.
“She didn’t show any remorse.”
But Carter’s lawyer said it was “a tragic case that she deeply regrets.”
Judge Lawrence Monis said, however, that in his opinion, her “age, level of maturity, or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions.”
The prosecutor read Roy’s mother Lynn Roy’s statement, which reads: “Not a day has passed that I have not mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I’m doing – I’m trying to support his sisters despite all the pain that will stay with us forever.”
Sister Roya Kamdin Roy said that she is constantly haunted by the thought that she will never be able to attend his wedding or become the aunt of his children.
“To hide the person who has always been with me since my birth is the pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life,” she said.
This case appears to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts that would provide for the responsibility of counsel for a person to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in a car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17 years old.
The case caught the attention of the entire country when it became known that he had been pushed to suicide by Carter's message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off the roof, stab yourself with a knife, I don't know many ways to eat," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was resting with his family.
A few minutes before she committed suicide, she wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You just have to turn on the ignition, and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said Carter wanted to gain attention through Roy's death, and banned her from communicating with the press to keep her from getting what she wanted.
The opinions of the lawyers on this matter are divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British flatmate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
The 30-year-old Knox published in the Los Angeles Times her own opinion, which stated: "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison."
Yevgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a high-flying bird"
One of the best basketball players of the VTB Unified League, 33-year-old Keith Langford left UNIX.
The departure of the American defender "Izvestiam" commented UNIX President Yevgeny Bogachev.
Kit made this decision on family circumstances, - said Yevgeny Bogachev.
He has a small child, a wife who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go meet him.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved a different relationship.
He played in UNIX for three seasons and in each match showed a high level, put on 100%.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and playing career.
Keith Langford played in the Kazan club for three years, winning the silver of the 2015/16 Unified League.
In the 2016/17 season, he was awarded the most successful player of the Euroleague season.
He averaged 21.75 points per game.
This is the second time since the award was established in 2004.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in EuroLeague history to win the award more than once.
In the near future, Langford will sign a contract with the Chinese "Shenzhen", informs Eurohoops.
The American is expected to sign a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will become the second star of the EuroLeague in July, which is moving to the Chinese championship.
Earlier in the Chinese CBA moved ex-center "Panatinaikos" Yannis Burusis.
A sunburnt tourist from the Moscow region was evacuated by helicopter in Adygea
Adygea rescuers today evacuated by helicopter from the mountainous region of the republic of the sub-Moscow tourist, who received the strongest sunburns.
The man rested in the shelter "Fischt", located at an altitude of 1.6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had increased pressure, as well as difficulty breathing.
A preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
The rescuers were approached by the head of the tour group, who told that the burned man had received in the campaign.
Audi plans to upgrade up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before the announcement by Audi, BMW said it would update the software on more than 350,000 vehicles.
BMW’s chairman said the company believes there are “more intelligent ways than driving restrictions,” referring to European cities, including Munich, where BMW is based, that were considering banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said on Thursday it was modifying three million Mercedes-Benz cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
None of the companies called their move a backlash.
European carmakers have been actively promoting the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to promote compliance with carbon dioxide emission rules.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines throw away are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost for automakers to install equipment that neutralizes the exhaust gases of diesel cars is also rising, and maintaining a competitive price for cars is becoming difficult.
While German automakers are under close scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government has also been accused of bribing influential automakers and ignoring signs of a problem.
The companies are trying not to repeat the mistakes of Volkswagen, which has hidden the use of so-called “destructive devices”, which during testing could adjust the amount of harmful gases emitted so that it complies with the rules, and in normal driving conditions were disconnected.
In the United States, a conviction was handed down to several Volkswagen executives, with the rest under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month in Germany, the former head of the thermodynamics department was arrested as part of the Audi engine development group.
A former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, an Italian, is therefore not protected from extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was subject to a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emissions rules and expanded the investigation, which had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation can create serious problems for Volkswagen: the manufacturer of luxury cars is the source of a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen’s income.
In Astrakhan, a visitor of the cafe paid with fake money
The police received a message from the employee of the bank’s department about the detection of a suspicious banknote with a denomination of 5,000 rubles when recalculating the funds received from the point of general interest.
A study conducted in the Expert-Criminalistic Center showed that it is false.
According to the UMVD of Russia in the Astrakhan region, one of the visitors of the cafe who bought the shaurma paid for the banknote.
It is worth noting that the cash register was not equipped with a device for determining the authenticity of banknotes.
Currently, the police are installing persons involved in the manufacture and sale of a deliberately fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years with a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs encourages residents of the Astrakhan region to be careful in carrying out financial transactions; employees of trade facilities are recommended to install devices to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found a “hell” planet on which even iron can melt
Having first studied the stratosphere properties of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were much surprised by its temperature, which is able to evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts have pointed out that water molecules are so heated by the light of the star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Space Telescope has captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes the water in the planet’s atmosphere to glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b refers to the so-called "hot Jupiters" - gas giants, in size and mass comparable to the largest planet in the solar system, but located dozens of times closer to the parent star.
Because of this, the year on the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "earth" days, and its gas shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change is threatening lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and southern France, but fears are now being expressed that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has become worse because of the dry weather and bearable diseases of insects; this has caused a constant headache for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Shess, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, says: “Lavanda in Provence is really under threat, because in recent years this plant has been feeling the effects of climate change: in spring and especially in autumn, the rains have become much less.
This affects the life of the lavender.
And there are still small cicadas jumping on the leaves of insects carrying micro-bacteria; in very dry weather they become very many.
There is a lot on the map.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is in high demand in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Shess says, “Instead of very long stems with a large number of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weakened, or absent at all.
That’s why we have fewer parts containing essential oil.”
Solutions that are currently under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and extracting varieties that are more resistant to drought.
Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
The two-time world champion in hockey, the ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 Alexander Semin met with the novice hockey players the day before and handed out autographs to the fans.
The meeting was held in the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019 as part of the thematic week dedicated to ice hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could ride on the skates on the site with artificial ice.
In addition, relays, quizzes and games were organized with a drawing of souvenir products of student games, preparation from the aerobics federation.
The event was attended by 50 students.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much as possible on the sports grounds and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of training is hard work and a huge desire to practice hockey.
“It is great that in Krasnoyarsk there is such a site as the tent of the Winter Universiade 2019, where novice athletes can ask questions directly to the coaches of the teams,” the champion said.
It should be noted that to promote student sports and healthy lifestyle among the Krasnoyarsk citizens are helped by the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019.
The Universiade tent will run throughout the summer season until September 25, the press service of the Directorate of the Winter Universiade-2019 reported.
In the State Department commented on the words of Medvedev
U.S. State Department official Heather Nauert, commenting at a briefing on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said the need to find "areas for interaction" with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be found in order to “improve bilateral cooperation”.
An example of such successful cooperation, Nauert called the armistice agreement on Syria.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work with each other," the diplomat said.
At the same time, Nauert refused to comment on Medvedev’s claim about a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
“If Russia has said this, then of course it has the right to say it, but I can’t say anything more on this subject,” the State Department spokesman said.
Earlier, U.S. President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said Washington had declared a full-fledged trade war on Moscow, putting an end to hopes of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said U.S. sanctions would last for decades.
In addition, according to the Prime Minister, the American establishment has “purely defeated” Trump.
The bodybuilder who disappeared in the Moscow region was found at a foreign dacha lost in memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very spicy circumstances: he left the car cabin to go to the toilet.
For seven days, he was unsuccessfully searched by familiar and local residents.
And there was Shamil at another man's house in Ramensky.
He was found naked in his toilet by his master.
The Dagestan athlete could not explain how he ended up here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was missing.
Identifying the person helped the announcement of his disappearance.
The doctors who arrived on the phone recorded Khanmetov's partial memory loss and brain injury, according to the public Mash.
Athletes are likely to have other surprises as well.
The attackers who kidnapped Shamil were probably already in his apartment, the keys from which he was also stolen.
Oil and gas revenues in July exceeded the forecast of 7.4 billion rubles
In fact, the oil and gas revenues received at the end of July 2017 exceeded the estimate of 7.4 billion rubles, according to the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation.
The excess, the department explains, occurred mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the ruble compared to the average monthly value of June used for the assessment, as well as due to the excess of the actual volume of gas production and the volume of exports of oil products of the projected levels.
“The deviation of the oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate, corresponding to the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019, in August 2017 is forecast in the amount of +40.2 billion rubles,” the Ministry of Finance said in a statement.
Thus, the total amount of funds sent for the purchase of foreign currency in the domestic foreign exchange market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47.6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of purchases of foreign currency will be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Each working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will enter into transactions for the purchase of foreign currency at organized auctions of the Moscow Stock Exchange evenly during the trading day.
The acquired foreign currency will be credited to the accounts of the Federal Treasury in the Central Bank.
The killing of a journalist underscores that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
Employees of the weekly newspaper Riodose usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover up the latest violent crimes in the state of Sinaloa related to organized crime, corrupt officials or the ongoing war of drug dealers.
But today, repressed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told to change their habits.
The two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children to an office that they had already dropped a grenade on in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote on the board, hanging in the room, three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - no evidence is needed, suspicions and internal feelings will be enough.
These are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being held by the government or the cartels, a whole list of villains due to which the work of lighting up the chaos in Mexico becomes dangerous.
Violence does not give a respite, and among the corpses that multiply in the country, more and more journalists: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people after attacks and threats are under federal protection; and this year, at least seven people have been injured.
Among the latter - their publisher and inspiration, co-founder of "Riodose" Javier Waldes Cardenas.
“The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist,” Valdes wrote in one of his many books on violent drug-related crimes.
His absence feels very sharp, although his presence is everywhere - a large photograph of Valdes showing his middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the facade of the building "Riodose"; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts in which
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; journalists discuss his general trauma, his nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, only two cases have been investigated so far.
As with most of the thousands of murders committed each year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, the killers of journalists rarely appear in court.
Riodos journalists insist they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, although they are killed by grief, although it is much more dangerous around now.
“Without information about the killers, without justice from security talks at meetings, there is little use,” Ibarra said.
“It’s very stupid to waste time in this seminar,” he says.
“Until we know the reason, we suspect everyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the office of "Riodose" in the capital of the state of Kuliakane.
He only managed to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which means "Twelve River".
The gunman left in his car and smashed it nearby.
Waldesu was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually spread quickly through Kuliakan.
But almost everyone is silent about Valdes.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the United States in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country as rival factions struggle to fill the resulting vacuum.
Let’s not talk about the fact that one or more people are killed every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two-story mausoleums of drug lords, which are more than the homes of many living people.
Let’s forget for a minute that the state of “quiet” is just when one of the cartels takes control of the coastal state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite this and the fact that Valdes knew perfectly well about the dangers of his work, Ismail Bohorkes, a 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, was crushed by guilt for not being able to protect a friend.
He thinks the murder was helped by two mistakes.
First, in February an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel, which is fighting with Guzman's sons.
The publication may have angered the sons; people who were allegedly gang members bought all copies of the publication as soon as they were brought to the newsstands.
The second mistake was that he did not force Waldes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that wrote about the same story was seized.
Valdes was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been out of danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Northeast and in 2003 he co-founded Riodos with five colleagues, selling his 50-dollar stock.
In Sinaloa, “it was impossible to engage in journalism without touching on the topic of drugs,” Bohorkes said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation of being a bold and honest publication, sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold reports without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to the fact that in this publication they could read about what no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riodosa received the prestigious Maria Moores Cabo Award for journalism in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdes won the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in investigating the drug trade in Mexico, wherever it went.
He openly admitted that he was afraid.
“I want to live on,” he said at the CPJ award ceremony.
The drug trade in Sinaloa is “a way of life,” he said in an October interview with Rompevinto TV.
“You have to take on the tasks that lie with you as a journalist – either that, or you’re just fooling around.”
I don’t want to be asked, “What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn’t you tell me what was going on?”
The employees of Riodos miss Waldes, a joker who squabbled like a port freighter, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to meet in person.
They relied on the order they were given.
He always had to wear his hat.
He had to go to El Guayabo, a bar across from the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: has he lost his love for the once established order?
His death forced them to doubt their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
“They don’t like it when you know about their wives, their kids, their legal business, and the underground airfields for transporting drugs.
"These things were behind the scenes," Bohorkes said.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from anything that smells bad.
The problem, says the editor of “Riodos” Andrés Villareal, is that “the obfuscation can be deceived ... and then what happened to Javier happens.”
The old rules, he says, and others, no longer operate in Sinaloa — as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states, where there is a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak government institutions, and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
In a room where Riotose employees gathered for security training, it was suddenly forbidden to bring cell phones: a few days before it became known that spy programs, which are sold exclusively to governments, are used in Mexico to monitor journalists and public activists.
Outside, two police officers hide in the shade of a tree from the 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were instructed by the state government to guard the office of Riodos, which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois quarter of Kuliakan.
Some journalists half-jokingly asked if these police officers were among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials that the governor himself said they could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that is de facto under the control of gangs of drug traffickers.
In the next issue of "Riodose" relied on three main themes.
This is the murder in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez.
They also had the disclosure of government expenditures concentrated in the governor’s hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping of people at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiac<0xC3><0xA1>n, in the neighborhood of the prosecutor's office.
It was not officially announced who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was necessary to be careful when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant at the same time drug dealers and authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a policy belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of power for almost the past century.
Recently, several PRI governors have been charged with high-profile corruption charges.
Villareal asked reporters to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when Guzman’s son El Chapo escaped from the military.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for a Waldes column with the most reliable information about the abduction.
“We would have known what had happened before,” says 46-year-old Villareal, nicknamed “El Flaco” for his artistic physique.
“Today all channels of communication with our sources are broken.”
The Waldesian cabinet is now used as a warehouse for posters and stickers with protests against the killings of journalists because employees have become what they never thought they would be: activists speaking out on behalf of the press.
The journalist Miriam Ramirez took several posters and went to a demonstration at the local prosecutor’s office the next morning, dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the state of Michoacan in the west of the country three days after Valdes was killed.
They found a burned body, and the authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
All over the country, journalists began to speak louder, organize protests and write "SOS Press" on sidewalks and walls of houses.
On that day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., trying to secure international support in the demand for justice in the Valdes case.
At a meeting with Sinaloa governor the day after the murder of Valdes Ramirez accused authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their killings for telling the truth.
After that, she asked not to give her more tasks to cover the activities of the government, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdes has said many times that journalists in Mexico are “surrounded” by organized crime, its accomplices in government, and indifferent society.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalistics, he wrote that reporters are not just being killed by gangs of drug traffickers; they are doing so on the orders of politicians and security services conspiring with organized crime.
The Articulo 19 Press Protection Committee believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were carried out at the behest of police and government officials.
“In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up,” Ramirez says.
Of course, murder scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Masias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
On her body was found a note supposedly written on the face of the Zetas cartel: “I am here because of my articles.”
The computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some newspapers chose to shut down as El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after its correspondent Miroslava Brich was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on like El Manyana from Nuevo Laredo after the 2004 assassination of its leader.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Ju<0xC3><0xA1>rez publicly addressed drug cartels with an editorial on the first page titled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists have left their home states or the country at all.
It's a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find a job, and they still face danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as apparently happened with photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work balance between risky decisions on a daily basis.
Ibarra – who once dreamed of being a poet – admits that he is afraid to write about drug trafficking.
“Mexico is going to hell, and that’s why I became a journalist,” he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the last issue was already ready for the press, the publishers of "Riodose" sat on the sidewalk near the office and drank beer when suddenly their phones simultaneously rang.
A series of gunfire between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan has reportedly left 19 dead.
The war continued to rage, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they put the news on the website "Riodose" through a mobile phone.
The next day I had to rewrite the first page.
The sirens were raised nearby - another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes looked to see if the police were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn’t show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of the deceased founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was put on the view of all Sinaloa, the employees of “Riodose” continued his work.
“How can you think of closing down,” Bohorkes said, “if on the same day that Javier was killed, a trainee asked me to send her out to do a report?”
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid the enemies.
At first glance, it looks like a statue, although terrifying.
The researchers said that the first found remains of an incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner survived so well that experts called it “The Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs.”
It survived so well that they were even able to determine that the color of his scaly skin was reddish-brown—and say that he had, in a way, a “dark past.”
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as “the most well-preserved of the Tyraeophore in the history of the finds and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.”
This fossil is a newly found specimen of a nodosaur that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good condition has stunned researchers who call him “really wonderful.”
This herbivore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind in the history of the finds, according to articles in the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Sean Fank while he was working at Sancor's Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.
The fossil he found was sent to the Royal Tirrell Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was carried out to detect an animal inside the earth’s depths weighing 2,500 feet (1,100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work has been done, the finished result can be demonstrated.
“It’s just a little sneeze, and you can almost believe he’s asleep,” said lead author Caleb Brown, a research fellow at the Royal Tyrell Paleontological Museum, where the creation is being demonstrated.
“It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved dinosaur specimens – the Mona Lisa among dinosaurs.”
By studying his skin, the researchers found that it was herbivorous, despite the fact that it was covered with armor and resembled a walking tank, apparently exposed to significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a protective technique known as protective paint, which is also used by many animals today.
This would allow him to merge more quickly with the surrounding environment and avoid encounters with enemies, experts say, suggesting he was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
The 110-million-year-old creature, belonging to the Nodosaurus family, was widely reported in the press in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tyrell Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of museum worker Mark Mitchell, one of the participants of the group, who spent more than 7,000 hours for his painstaking excavation.
The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international group of scientists to document the drawing and shape of the shells and armor plates on his body.
They found a protective paint, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its lower side.
Although the protective paint is well distributed, the discovery came as a surprise, because the size of the Borealopelta dinosaur is significantly larger than the size of the currently living animals with the protective paint.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred to disguise confrontation as a way of survival.
But most modern animals with a protective coat of paint — such as deer, zebras, or armored personnel carriers — are much smaller in size and more affordable prey, indicating that nodosaurs had to fight hard for survival.
“The serious threat from predators to a massive, heavily armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Melo period were,” Brown said.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in the dinosaur’s scales also suggests that its skin should have been reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study an animal looking for information about its life, including the preserved contents of its digestive tract, to find out what it ate during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was taken to the sea, where it sank and its back lay down to the bottom of the ocean.
At that time, Alberta was as warm as it is now in southern Florida, and rivers and oceans were likely to have spread far deeper into the land than they are now.
“This nodosaur is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, and at the same time fully preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal,” Brown said.
“As a result, the animal now looks almost the same as it did then, in the Early Cretaceous period.
You don’t have to use your imagination to recreate it, you just have to sneeze a little, and you can practically believe that he’s asleep.”
The Cretaceous period is an era when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of these, the Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than the Borealopelta, one of its formidable ancestors could hunt for the thyrophore.
These include the acrocanthosaur, a monster 38 feet (11.5 meters) long with a weight of six tons.
Scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was taken to the sea after his death and mummified in the ileum.
The creature was found by Sean Fank while he was working at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum’s staff, it is the best-preserved thyroid in the world, along with skin and armor, and it targets, from the muzzle to the femur.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
Their characteristic feature was two twenty-inch spikes protruding from the shoulders.
The researchers believe that this herbivorous typhoon hit hard on what is now Canada until the spilled river took it into the open sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its armor with precision to the smallest details.
The fossilized remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the bulging armor plates along the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greschko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, such a degree of preservation is “rarely like winning a lottery.”
The longer I look at him, the more amazing he seems.
The fossilized remains of the skin still cover the bushy armor plates, sowing the animal's skull.
His right front leg is extended along the side, five fingers on it are turned up.
I can count the pebbles on his sole.”
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia, and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
At the same time, he did so without having documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish edition of Telewizja Republika, which posted on its YouTube channel a video with his speech.
Saakashvili spoke at an event in honor of the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler’s troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start speaking in this language, he had to speak English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched on the topics of Georgia’s cooperation with Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
About the fact that the migration service of Ukraine deprived his citizenship, the paying politician learned while in the United States.
How exactly he managed to make a transatlantic flight without documents is still unknown.
Earlier, the former governor of the Odessa region Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining citizenship of Ukraine was faked.
The politician stressed that he did not fill out any questionnaires.
The investigation period in the Weinziher and Olhovic case is extended until January
The period of preliminary investigation in the case of the co-owner of the group of companies "Renova" Evgeniy Olhovic and the head of energy holding "T Plus" Boris Weinziher has been extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basmanny Court is considering extending the house arrest of the accused.
The representative of the SC at the meeting informed about the decision to extend the period of preliminary investigation for the last time.
"The particular complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to remove and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as conduct investigative actions on the territory of several Russian subjects," the investigator said.
He added that the suspects regularly bribed the Komi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinziher, Olkhovik, as well as the former head of the CJSC "Complex Energy Systems" Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed the company "Vimpelcom", handed over to the highest officials of the Republic of Komi bribes for the establishment of the most favorable tariffs for heating as well.
Weinziher and Olkhovik were detained, transferred to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped from the investigation and was declared in a federal search.
How did one activist find out the answer to the question “Whose streets?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the depths of her soul.
Just a day after arriving in New York as part of a tourist trip, a native of St. Louis was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, viewing a Facebook feed on his phone.
She ran into someone from high school.
“The police just killed an eighteen-year-old child, and he’s still in the middle of the street.”
Noticing that no one else on her tape had posted this information, she closed her Facebook account and opened her Twitter account.
There were a lot of user posts with @TheePharoah.
The rapper from Greater St. Louis tweeted about the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's lifeless body, scattered across the street, where it will be for four hours.
“It’s wild,” Ferrel thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She put off the phone, and later that evening returned to tweets that people were going to the Canfield Drive.
There were photos of a signal tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown’s father holding a poster with the words: “Ferguson policeman just killed my unarmed son!”
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, picked up a rifle stick and said, “I’m going to kill all of you... animals!”
"It's a non-standard situation," Ferrel said at the time, according to her own memories.
“This is not a murder like the ones we are used to and can call typical.
At that moment, I felt cold.
I was angry and crying.”
She took the ticket for the return flight and flew home the next day.
Landing at 11 p.m., she took her six-year-old daughter from her father’s house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson over the next almost three years has become the subject of a new documentary, Whose Streets?, which will be released on August 11.
It’s a story about survival and protest, about love and loss, strength and resilience from the perspective of people living in the community and filling the streets, demanding answers.
While Ferrel was on her way to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower dress and a wreath of flowers, they recalled a conversation they had had countless times before this morning, “about the experiences of black people and their situation.”
She recalls saying, “Do you remember how I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson right now because a policeman killed an 18-year-old boy, and that was wrong."
“I couldn’t help but take her,” Ferrel said later.
“What is happening today is the culmination of what happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and grow up on it.
She must not only be well versed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of experience of blacks and their situation and what we must do to be free to be free.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she herself will not face obvious racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel like I would have done her a bad favor if I had protected her from that.”
When they arrived in Ferguson, the first stop they made was at South Florissant Road, on a site across the road from a police station that had become something of a tent camp, while activists were waiting for reports of Officer Darren Wilson’s final non-indictment.
There, Ferrel and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who cooked lunch packages.
They collected the packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
Little by little, Ferrel found a new type of activism in his mind.
“My activism has completely changed since August 9,” she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Sanitary Students, representing national minorities, and engaged in food justice and health inequality among black communities.
“I had no experience as an organizer.
It came by itself.”
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrel met Saba Folayan, one of his co-directors.
Folayan said she and her main operator, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer, “just wanted to document” the events.
Ferrel came up with the question: “Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story that you can play on?”
This skepticism was fueled by numerous people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, “We’ve heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson don’t get the spotlight, and we wanted to do it differently.”
By that time, Folayan had already teamed up with her co-director, Damon Davis, a local artist known for her activism on death row issues.
His participation aroused a sympathy for the project with Ferrel and six other locals, with whom the team of the project "Whose Streets?" kept in touch during the years after Brown's murder.
“In this documentary, no one speaks for us or with us, we speak for ourselves,” Davis said.
“It was the most important thing for me how these people are going to be represented, because that’s how I’m going to be represented.”
And although the project’s goal was not to focus on Ferrel’s experience at all – in an effort to show that the movement “is not about a savior leader, but about how the community unites,” as Folayan said – it turned out to be the most open of the film’s participants.
As a result, “Whose Streets?” suddenly reveals the personal aspects of Ferrel’s life, such as how she fell in love and married his wife.
“I felt naked,” Ferrel said, laughing as she recounted how I first saw the finished product.
“But I understood that when you do that kind of work and humanize black people, there has to be some level of vulnerability.”
In addition, Ferrell’s story again discusses and emphasizes the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement — those who created the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the 2012 murder of black teenager Trayvon Martin — have attributed themselves to homosexuals.
“Black gay women in leadership positions support this whole movement,” says Ferrel, “and it’s all because we’re constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all of this burden.”
Folayan agreed with the claim, noting that “the movement is actually supported by black women and a host of gay black women.”
However, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination" and that Ferrel was not chosen as the central character of the film because of its distinctive features.
“She was the person who awakened that energy,” she said.
"On the other hand, it's no coincidence that she was in the foreground because when she was in the
You can feel her energy through the screen.”
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long been without a movie camera, but there are complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrel will be on probation for another two-and-a-half years for shutting down the highway during the demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place, which she calls home, simply: “Bardak”.
She's still holding on to the speech she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson full three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.”
Two Salvadoran footballers disqualified for biting U.S. players
El Salvador national football team players Henry Romero and Darwin Seren have received lengthy disqualifications for unsportsmanlike behavior.
During the quarter-final match of the Gold Cup of the Confederations football North and Central America and the countries of the Caribbean (CONCACAF), Salvadorans bit American players.
The first was the defender Henry Romero.
The Salvadoran man bit the assailant, Josie Altidore, and then pinched him in the chest.
Then the midfielder Seren, while serving a corner in his penalty area, bit U.S. defender Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three games and Seren for six.
The meeting itself ended with the victory of the Americans with a score of 2:0, reports Goal.com.
The emergence of similarity: the artist creates portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
In the center of the hall in the Friedman Gallery in New York from the ceiling on the wire hang the faces of people - white, black and brown, all somewhat elusively similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from cheek strokes and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning has sent in cuts from Fort Lawnworth Prison, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the notorious transmission of confidential diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened on August 2, is called "The Rise of Similarity".
This is the result of a two-year correspondence between Dewey-Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and a famous dissident, whom Barack Obama commuted just three days before the end of his presidency.
Analysing using a computer program of DNA obtained from Manning and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of individuals who could be in people with such a genome, Dewey-Harborg created a deep, though not easy to perceive manifesto, dedicated not only to the plasticity of these DNAs and to the various ways in which they could be represented.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has openly said she considers herself a woman since she was a teenager, was sentenced in 2013 to 20 episodes, including six violations of the Espionage, Computer Fraud and Stealing Act.
Her photographs in prison were inaccessible, so only one of her photographs was known: a grainy black-and-white selfie, in which Manning, in a platinum shade of wig, clearly feeling uncomfortable, sits behind the wheel of a car; with this photograph she and began to associate.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg successfully completed her 2012 project “Visions of Strangers”.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence such as pickles and chewing gum, separating DNA from this garbage and creating images of what these people might look like.
And then she got an email from Paper Magazine.
“They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article,” Dewey-Hagborg explained at a preview of a new exhibition for the press.
At the time, Chelsea could not be visited and photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait made of her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her imprisoned muse became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote a comic book called “Suppressed Images,” illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which depicted how in the future the president would ease Chelsea’s punishment and be able to visit the exhibition in person.
The fact that Obama really decided to release Manning just days after the book came out was a pleasant surprise after seven hard years in a Kansas military prison.
There’s something deep and strong about the fact that the exhibition opens right now when Donald Trump declares war on people revealing secret information in the government and invents new ways to inflame the animosity he’s meant to soften on Twitter.
When Dewey-Harborg was asked if all this coincided in time, she said that “nothing happens by chance.”
In a statement, the artist wrote on the wall of the gallery, a huge Manning signature at the bottom (with a heart instead of a point above the “i” in her name) calls for an end to “an automatic division based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture.”
On the opposite side is its mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar of pencils C, G and A.
Including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist puts it scientifically), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how amazingly similar we all are, at least in terms of our biological structure.
“I hope to explain to people that our genome doesn’t define what we are, how open genetic data is to interpretation, and how subjective it is,” Dewey-Harborg said; her 2007 video work “False Memories” is also exhibited here.
“DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here.”
The last part of the exposition, which fits in one room, is the novel mentioned above in the comics.
On it, King Kong-style Manning appears above the U.S. Correctional Facility building with a loudspeaker in hand.
“If they kill your speech, they will win,” it says.
"Therefore, never be silent."
“This is a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me,” says the artist, who hails from Philadelphia.
"I still have ants on my skin when I talk about it."
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person – as it was vividly depicted in the comics – but when she arrives, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulacrums gathered like crowds of protesters.
This is also done intentionally, like everything at the exhibition up to the height (5"2, the growth of Manning), on which the pencil was drawn genetic haplogroups.
“I used to hang them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd of people,” Dewey-Harborg says of the portraits.
“I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, like the movement that stood behind its liberation.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted by police on murder charges <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
According to the police, there is a nationwide raid on a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University, who are being sought as suspects due to the fact that a man was found stabbed to death in a luxury room in Chicago.
According to Cook County court records, arrest warrants were issued on Monday for premeditated murder without the right to release on bail of forty-two-year-old Vindem Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Gwent.
According to the documents, twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after multiple stab wounds were inflicted on him.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call, they came to the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
According to officials, Cornell-Duranlo was pronounced dead at the scene of the crime, and now detectives are investigating the death from knife wounds, considering it a murder, while police are searching hard for two suspects.
Latham has been an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbadge, vice president of the University of Communications, said in an emailed statement that Latham was on administrative leave and was barred from entering Northwestern University campuses.
“It is now a criminal case that is being investigated by the authorities, and the North-West University is cooperating with the investigation,” Kabbaj said.
Warren is a Senior Financial Officer at the University of Oxford.
A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: “We have contacted the UK police and are ready to provide any necessary assistance to the US investigative authorities.”
The statement also said Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to surrender.
Chicago Police Chief of Communications Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly advises suspects to surrender to the authorities.
“The police have assumptions about their location, but our attempts to find them are intensifying,” Guglielmi said.
According to Guglielmi, local, regional and federal authorities are assisting in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police were called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in room 1008.
The police called the crime scene terrible.
Guglielmi said it was not clear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
According to him, the data from the video camera confirm that Latham and Warren were in the building.
“We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship,” Guglielmi said.
The management of the Grand Plaza issued an appeal to the guests, in which it was reported: “At the moment, the police are working on the chronology of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: “We will comply with the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the conditions of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) set for the resumption of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be fulfilled soon.
“A certain stage in meeting the requirements has been passed, RUSADA has been given the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (the UK anti-doping agency).
WADA’s road map has been updated accordingly,” Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA road map on the restoration of the status of compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for RUSADA’s resumption of work and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could present difficulties for Russia.
“Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future,” he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian andidoping structures must publicly acknowledge the results of a WADA-ordered investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
Speaking on the matter, Mutko said: “We are investigating as our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what was not.”
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
In the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian edition of Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged the problems that had previously occurred in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report," Smirnov added.
WADA removed RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 following a doping scandal.
However, in June this year he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After a visit to the organization’s Moscow office in July, WADA CEO Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was “moving in the right direction” to restore its work.
Fire breaks out at 79-storey tower in Dubai
A major fire that broke out in one of the world’s tallest residential buildings, The Torch Tower, has been extinguished.
It is noted that the firefighters managed to cope with all the fires by 4.00 local time (3.00 MSK).
Local authorities said no one was injured in the incident.
At the time of the fire, the streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed.
The reasons for what happened are not yet known.
Earlier it was reported that in Dubai is burning 79-storey residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world.
All residents were evacuated on time.
Inconceivable outfit Buzovoy shock fans: pants that do not cover panties
The scandalous reality show "Dom-2" Olga Buzova impressed the audience of the festival Europa Plus Live with dances in panties.
In front of thousands of fans, the newly-appeared singer performed a duet with Nastey Kudry with the song "We will be hot".
The two girls went on stage in provocative “breeches”, sewn in such a way that the underwear of the singers appeared on the scene.
On the trousers were made the inscriptions Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier it was reported how changes in the appearance of Buzova commented a specialist of one of the Moscow clinics of plastic surgery.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, August 4, the news service "Radio 4" with reference to foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation with Crimea and “destabilization in eastern Ukraine.”
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia, however, is possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said that relations between the US and Russia are at a dangerously low level, and accused the US Congress of doing so.
The metro of Yekaterinburg is mastering a new way of payment
In October, travel to the Yekaterinburg metro will be possible to pay with a bank card, said Pavel Vedernikov, general director of I-Network, in an interview with the Regional newspaper.
Our goal is to introduce to the 2018 World Cup the same system of payment for travel in the metro as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the world, to be able to use the metro with their bank cards, without buying chips and without standing in line," he said.
Startups that will help your company not to become another “Uber”
Amy Errett wanted to assess the level of satisfaction among employees of her startup in the field of e-commerce, but the surveys did not work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some employees didn’t trust the process.
“He’s never been consistent and objective,” said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person hair care e-commerce company based in San Francisco.
She turned to third parties for help.
Now a new kind of start-ups in the field of work with staff is emerging, which help companies to find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to make express surveys, address specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and in some cases allow informants to be targeted.
“We now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, but where is Fitbit for your company?” says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Glint, a Redwood City startup whose analytics programs are used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she has achieved a greater understanding of what her employees think and feel in three years of using Glint.
In addition to express surveys and questionnaires of certain teams, the product offers a heat map of the company and shows in a visual form, which units have more complaints and which managers have a low approval rating, which allows it to understand why.
Companies are becoming increasingly aware that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will become another “Uber” who was involved in the scandal when a former employee posted a blog post describing an aggressive situation in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For startups like Glint, it’s a desire to control the situation – an opportunity for a profitable business.
According to the Internet portal “Let’s talk about payment”, dedicated to financial technologies, the industry of global management, regulation and compliance by 2020 can cost more than 118.7 billion dollars.
The Denver, Colorado-based Convercent startup, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, noted a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber’s declining reputation.
The company has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft, and Tesla.
Recently, “Uber” appeared among customers.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send custom-made surveys of staff opinions, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides a hotline for anonymous text messages that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the management.
“The court of public opinion has seized power from the inspectors,” said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If it turns out that the company is mishandling employees or behaving unethically, even if the inspectors don’t intervene, the company could face costly consequences in the form of customer boycotts, employee outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a chain of restaurants with more than 25,000 employees in 500 establishments, has been using Convercent for more than a year to make sure employees are aware of the rules and procedures, and to offer an easy way to contact the company’s head office.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to search for a phone number or email from the head office, file a formal complaint and hope to take it seriously.
It was often a frightening and embarrassing experience, said James Vitrano, chief legal officer at Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now that the company is using the “Convert” service, problems that were previously hidden from managers sitting in offices in other cities or states – such as discrimination, harassment and unfair pay – can be detected and addressed more quickly.
“I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the employee situation,” said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
“And we protect our shareholders from lawsuits with employees.”
According to Quinland, the companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after Arthur Andersen’s accounting firm collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of the Enron Affair.
But it wasn’t until “social media became widespread” that the companies realized they wouldn’t be able to keep their dirty underwear from spreading the virus online.
“Before we started using technology to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both “Glint” and “Convert” offer their software as a service, charging companies a regular fee for using their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that has received the approval of venture investors who have supported both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company’s total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company’s total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research shows that today’s employees expect more from their jobs than they used to.
In markets with stiff competition, such as Silicon Valley, high wages, and interesting projects, this is just the minimum needed.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted and valued, and that they dedicate their time to a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in a company, feel that they are heard, and that the work they do brings results, they are more trying to make such a company successful,” says Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, where both Glincent and Convercent are used.
Investors get income when the business of companies from their portfolio goes well; the business of companies goes well when employees are loyal and engaged.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it’s no surprise that they find support.
According to experts on culture in the workplace, it is important to have data on employee involvement.
But the data is useless until the company’s trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can create the impression that changes are coming.
And if the changes don’t come fast enough, or don’t come at all, disappointment may develop, and employees will lose interest.
“If you’re going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you should be prepared to hold 4,000 interviews,” says Russell Ratt, president of consulting at Kotter International, which had to see companies make a mistake by relying too much on data collection.
“Because if you don’t go to the end, employees will be like, ‘Did you really hear me?
You don't care?
If you don’t care, why shouldn’t I care?”
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports a problem with Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees unhappy with the speed of decision-making and quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long run, this knowledge will help it to keep employees in an industry known for its high staff turnover.
“If you don’t try to create a culture of transparency, you’re going to lose people,” Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul opened a new asphalt on the avenue Krasnoarmeysky
In Barnaul, radical measures were taken to eliminate the cause of asphalt failures on Krasnoarmeysky Avenue.
The place where the pits on the recently paved part of the road (crossing from the Youth Street) twice appeared, it was decided to "open".
Recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tram tracks was due to the fact that the land in the area of the homeless unexploited network.
According to the deputy chairman of the city committee on road economy, improvement, transport and communication Ivan Garmat, for a detailed survey and elimination of the preconditions for the collapse will be conducted a detailed survey.
Depending on its results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is assumed that it will be necessary to restore the formwork of non-household communications and to concretize them.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins team has to do longer because the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day.
Time is approaching eleven in the evening; a crowd of football players from the University of California, Los Angeles is delayed to chat on one side of the team’s new training fields located on campus.
Some of them pulled out their T-shirts, exposing their backs glowing with sweat after a tense first day of sports camp.
For many players, these minutes of idleness are a break in the middle of the day.
Players enrolled in summer classes, after a three-hour training, will go back to the dormitories to prepare for the final exams, and the next morning will return to the Wasserman football center for meetings at 6:30.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, team coach Jim Mora said, “In the next three days, these guys are waiting for a meat grinder.”
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on players, actually lengthened their working day — at least until the exams ended on Friday.
Therefore, the beginning of the first three trainings of the team of the University of California in Los Angeles was assigned at 7:15 p.m., so that they fit into the already tight schedule of players.
The side effect of not having two workouts a day has been a greater number of days with one workout, and the Bruins are pushing the start of the camp for almost a week compared to last year and are training during summer school for the first time in six seasons of the Westwood Sea.
According to the schedule, they will have to hold 18 training sessions until August 20 inclusive before they begin official preparation for the first game of the season against the Texas A&M University team in September.
Mora said he supports the change of rules by the National Student Sports Association, despite the fact that due to him, another item appeared in the tight schedule of players.
“Within three or four days we’re giving them this huge load, it’s a serious test,” Mora said.
“And they just got over it, they’re working, they’re great guys.
I think when we get through Saturday and we have more time, it’s going to be really great.”
When the camp is over, the University of California, Los Angeles, will make the trainings closed; this is not an easy task, as its fields are in direct view from the adjacent parking lot and from the neighboring "Laskin Center", an expensive hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs.
Players from the Bruins are expected to occupy the hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“We will have security,” Mora said.
“It’s a serious problem, and I’m not exaggerating the danger by suggesting that someone can take off the room, sit there and record the training on video.
If you have a training video, this is very serious.
But we'll have security there and security at parking lot number eight.
We will do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about that.
We have a plan.”
All the victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg have been discharged from hospitals
All the victims of the attack in the St. Petersburg metro in April have been discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of Deputy Governor Anna Mityanina.
According to data at the end of July, three people remained in the hospital, reports TV Center.
We will remind, the explosion in the St. Petersburg metro broke out on April 3 of this year.
The bomb was detonated by the suicide bomber Akbarzhon Jalilov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the perpetrator himself.
In the criminal case, 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abor Asimov, were arrested.
The day before, Rospotrebnadzor recommended the St. Petersburg Metro to revise the plan of measures to ensure transport safety, in particular by increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook strengthens fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts suspected of mystification to independent experts and show their conclusions under original posts, the world's largest social network, which is trying to fight so-called fake news, said on Thursday.
In a statement on its website, the company said it is beginning to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible mystifications, send them for verification, and possibly display fact-checking results under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main ways of spreading so-called fake news, which many believe influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
This issue is also being actively debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports ahead of the May presidential election, and in Germany before the September election declared support for the plan to fine social networks if they do not promptly remove posts that are infuriated.
On Thursday, in a separate statement in German, Facebook said it was testing a new fact-checking algorithm that was launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
“In addition to seeing what messages are challenged by independent reviewers, people want to have a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and what they share,” Sarah Sue, Facebook’s news feed manager, wrote in her blog post.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the “related articles” feature and work on other changes in the news feed to address the issue of fake news.
Create a novel-comic: One castle in English history
In the recent past, Scotty's tiny castle was filmed in the music video "Squeeze", and in the 70s and 80s served as a haven for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy spot in the Buell River Valley in Kent County, he has watched the tumultuous history around, and now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with land-haired and a penchant for historical documents, to a novel-comic.
“I think it’s so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago,” he says.
"You feel it so personal when you hold this letter in your hand."
The Castle in England covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells of the families who lived in Scotland; each story is illustrated by one of the young British artists – Isaac Lenkevich, Brianie May Smith, William Axley, Becky Palmer and Isabelle Grinber.
This is not the first book by Rhodes to be based on archival data: in 2014 he wrote Teeth of a Dead Man and Other Stories, a collection of British Library documents; this project unexpectedly touched him to the depths of his soul.
“I could have been scratched by just a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working on the Jacobites,” he says.
"It's the fingerprint of his finger."
And the letters always smell of smoke, because in those times the lights were on.
And in 300 years, in the future, you feel like you're there, too.
Oh, how I love the archives!"
For a person with such a passion for old papers, getting support from the National Foundation and the English Arts Council and living in a castle for four months (“Honestly, I got a bit stuck there”) seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent days studying the "new" Victorian castle, going through the archives and looking at numerous treasures of the estate and ancient things - for example, the heads of hyenas on the walls or bottles that had lain in the ditch for centuries.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking with the foresters, gardeners and sometimes with artists who worked on illustrations for his book.
Then, at night, he “drinked whiskey and sat down to write.”
The history of Scotty Castle is not very well studied, because the National Fund gained full access to it only in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hassy, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, employees were just starting to deal with the archive, which he describes as “what aristocrats have been doing for centuries”.
Diaries, letters from the time of the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You think land disputes are boring," says Rhodes, "but two families fought for this birch.
It happens, guys!”
In some stories, the castle collection becomes the starting point for wider explorations in English history: for example, in The Worker, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
“There are reports of a rebellion that occurred at the castle in 1380, in a book called ‘The Knight Families of Kent and Sussex,’” Rhodes says.
“The Peasant Rebellion began in these places, and I thought the revolt was the right start.
Maybe they were connected?”
Other stories are closely related to the history of the castle - for example, the "Priest", which tells of a Jesuit priest, whom the Darrelov family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "Contrabandist", about the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrel, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by stoning the tomb (this was discovered a few years later when the tomb was excavated).
Darrely is Rods’s favorite family of all the people who lived in Scotty’s house: “The gentlemen seem to have been a perfect fraud, forever in debt, and spent money on things they couldn’t afford.
In different generations of men, the Darrels have solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women – I imagine them to be the company of cute guys who know how to care for the heirs of great fortunes.
After completing his work at Rhodes Castle, he is looking for other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish Deaf, where he wrote a graphic novel about Eliamianm<0xC3><0xA4>ki – a place where there was a sanatorium at the beginning of the 20th century, and then it grew again in the forest.
But Scotty remains a special place for him.
“I was sad to leave,” he says.
“I felt something like this: Hell, I have to go back to real life.”
Fifteen of the largest banks choose “Russia”
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: following Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC "Otkritie", seven other credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the share of organizations that have left the ARB will be at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not just a way out - all the banks that have declared a break with the ARB, are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions, - the Association of regional banks "Russia", headed by the well-known politician Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on the financial market, recognized, by the way, as a result.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was set during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council considered new bills, in particular, suggesting a new classification of banks according to the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, president of the ARB, said that, in the opinion of the association, this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which thus try to limit the capabilities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims were criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justifiably carry out the withdrawal of licenses from some banks, which, however, was followed by an objection from the representative of the Central Bank: many executives of the expropriated banks, in particular, Vnezhprombank, entered the organs.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in a very sensitive to relations with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, having declared a disagreement with the policy of the ARB, began to prepare for joining the association "Russia", noting that "the effect on the performance of the work is low".
Investors will be better.
How will it end?
Let’s answer the main question that arises with the slightest failure or conflict in the banking sector or near it: investors are not threatened, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Head of “Russia” Anatoly Aksakov, known for his sensitivity in all matters concerning the interests of banks and their clients, a high-level professional, which is highly appreciated in the Central Bank: almost all the management of the Central Bank is present at the annual activities of the association, and all significant legislative initiatives are evaluated through the pro-regulator.
In the personnel-organizational plan, obviously, also no special shock is foreseen.
Undoubtedly, the ARB finds itself in a difficult financial and management situation after losing such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, in this oldest organization, established in 1991, the organization that defends the interests of the banking community, has considerable potential to continue to improve the banking legislation and the field of monetary circulation in general.
It can not be said that in the association "Russia" with outstretched arms are ready to accept under any conditions new members, judging by the reaction of its leader, Anatoly Aksakov ("maybe too much will want"), who still on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper, said that he was "represented by us".
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
Now the negotiation process is under way, proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the international banking forum.
That's where we'll decide.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "the chair is not held", called possible new head of the updated association "Russia" Georgy Luntovsky, who leaves in September the post of Vice President of the Central Bank, highly characterizing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is now vacationing in Crimea, plans to take a day off and arrive in Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Association "Russia", where it is planned to consider the agenda of the extraordinary congress "Russia".
The entry of gasoline-powered cars into major cities of Russia will not be limited
Deputy head of the Ministry of Transport Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of gasoline-powered cars into major Russian cities will not be limited.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is that we need to gradually increase the environmental class.
And there the concept immediately move to zero emissions.
I don’t think we’re technically ready for that.
The question is, from what year?
It’s the same at the phrase level – let’s ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Will the whole city shut down?
"Twenty years from now, I don't know, maybe that's what's going to happen," the Prime Minister said.
Earlier, the newspaper "Izvestia" reported that by August 17, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was tasked to study the proposals on possible options for state support of electric transport, presented to the government by the general director of PJSC KamAZ Sergey Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, - the use of cars with DVS in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing its green card rules.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump said that a new U.S. immigration plan will be adopted, according to which the rules for obtaining a green card will be changed.
The plan provides for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be discussed in two chambers of Congress.
“This law will reduce poverty, raise wages and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will provide benefits to candidates who possess English, have the money resources that allow them to maintain themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy,” Trump said.
The emergence of sex robots is real, and it should worry us
We did not have time to think that 2017 could not get any worse, there is a new report on technological progress in the production of sex robots.
Yeah. Yeah.
Sex robots are in the spotlight now.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, a distinguished professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we should take their appearance seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the eyes of robots, the shape of nipples and the type of nails.
“People are giggling about it, but firms are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and soon we’ll see a lot more of them,” Sharkey said at the presentation of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable counterparts into robots with silicone skin, warm to the touch, and with almost human-like replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robots to their liking, choosing everything from the color of the eyes and the shape of the robot nipples to the shape and color of the nails.
But the fact that many robots have a “personality” in comparison to which Stepford’s Wife would seem very progressive is even more worrying.
Modern sex dolls have turned into robots with silicone skin.
For example, the firm RealBotix robot allows users to customize in robots quality, which they find attractive - for example, shyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with an already programmed personality - for example, "Cold Farrah" makes the impression of shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "brave" character.
“Roxxxy Gold has a character that fits perfectly with yours,” the True Companion website said in a statement.
So she loves what you love, doesn’t love what you don’t love, and so on.
She changes her mood during the day, like a real person!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she may “be in the mood”!
In the appearance of sex robots, much is worrying - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the most disturbing is the submissive image of a woman, an association with rape that causes the mastery of the Cold (read: resisting.)
On the site "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared with a vibrator, only for men.
“If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can’t men have a Roxxxy?”
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity points to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a departure from the ideal of gender equality towards the desire for sex with submission as an optional additive.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and although the FRR is celebrating their growing popularity, they are still on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meanings of the era in which we live.
And many people are not stupid and not aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It’s no coincidence that these complex sex robots emerged precisely when women’s rights around the world were at risk, when there was a president in the White House who boasted of being attached to women.
The scariest thing about The Handmaid’s Tale is not the graphic images, the twisted bodies and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it does not seem so great now.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve the physical likeness of real women (only with the proportions of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to look and feel like humans, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it is by their "characters" robots do not look like real women.
They can’t break up with their partners or walk away from them.
They have neither a life of their own nor a biography – nothing that could indicate independence or anything else that could destroy the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
The Los Angeles native Eugene (Push) Jeter, who has been running for the Ukrainian national team since 2013, will not help our national team at the European basketball championship, the final part of which will start on August 31.
This was reported in an interview with BeBasket portal by the general manager of "blue-yellow" Andrey Lebedev.
We tried to make a deal with Jeter, but unfortunately, he won't come for family reasons.
We’re going to EuroBasket without a naturalized player because we don’t want to take someone we don’t know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
I will remind: with Jeter's direct participation, the Ukrainian team took a record sixth place for itself at Eurobasket-2013 and for the first time got to the World Basketball Championship, where the "yellow-blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the native of the United States scored an average of 3 for the game, 15 o.
Jeter has stopped playing for the Ukrainian national team since leaving the post of head coach of our national team American Mike Fratello, who left this post in 2015.
The men’s EuroBasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold their matches of the group tournament on the promised Earth.
The underdogs of Yevgeny Murzin in Group B will have five fights: with Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3rd), Lithuania (5th) and Israel (6th).
As part of the preparation for the tournament, our men's team held two control matches, in which it conceded to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's great achievement?
To portray Mita Romney seems to be very reasonable.
In the Trump era, the commonplace was the fact that political disputes that polarized the American electorate, at the micro level, broke up some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the U.S. newspapers squandered columns on how to deal with the terrible relatives who voted for Trump.
I think we're all so tense that we're about to burst.
Less is said about Trump’s ability to connect families.
I write about it because my cousin, left-wing Chicago poetess, who has long been on knives with Republicans in her family, came to me in New York this week.
She reminded me that uniting in the fight against the common enemy can have a strong effect.
Under Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother she has argued with about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely found themselves on the same side.
After dinner, this is certainly good; but I can’t help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has instilled strength in his left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule can move us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and “normalization,” we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will cease to be affected by his outbursts.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump “normalizes” the most right-wing Republicans, who, against the background of his standards, will suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I got caught up in the fact that I miss the old-fashioned insanity of Mitt Romney today – with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looked like) – compared to Trump and both seem very little evil.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will just have to be in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we went with the kids for a carousel in Central Park - the largest carousel in the New York City Parks Department and the best way in the city to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are ugly and huge, the pictures of the fiberglass on the central drum - the clowns and the animals, who, when bent, look in horror at their backs, are extremely ominous, and the ringing music, strange as it may seem, excites.
So many famous things in this city disappoint: the views from the skyscrapers are outdated, the silhouettes of buildings are too crowded to cause alarm, and the reality of the city does not succeed in the dream.
Thirty-five years have passed, and I'm still experiencing the day I found out that the Swiss Cottage area is not really a Swiss chalet (thematic pub "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" is not an account), but a large circular crossroad in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old child, an eleven-year-old child and two women in their forties can have a great time.
If I could put a carousel score, I would put a five, but fortunately, no one asked me to.
And in the department store this week, I was asked to evaluate my "experience" of shopping on a scale of one to five stars before holding a card on the terminal.
In a coffee shop on the corner of my street still the same plus the option to accompany the assessment with a 15% teapot is for ordering at the counter.
As a result, not only does the neutral interaction slow down, but also has to bring a personal attitude to a situation that does not involve it.
The poor saleswoman in the department store smiled confoundedly while I was tired of appreciating my experience of giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital due to chest pain
Pistorius is leaving prison because of a visit to the doctor for the second time.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for treatment of cuts on his wrists, which the prison administration said he received as a result of falling in a cell.
Pistorius was convicted of manslaughter after the prosecutor's office appealed the initial conviction for premeditated murder.
He killed Steinkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her several times through the bathroom door in his Pretoria home.
Pistorius stated that he took his girlfriend for a night thief hiding in his toilet.
The prosecutor's office said it intends to file another protest, this time against the six-year term of Pretoria, which it said was too mild.
The Prosecutor General’s Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be considered this year.
The term of Pretoria may be increased by 15 years if the prosecutor’s office succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
The suspect in the beating of the journalist NTV selected a subscription on non-exit
The city’s law enforcement officers chose a measure of restraint in the form of a non-departure subscription for a man who attacked NTV journalist Nikitu Razvozhayev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Volk.
"In the framework of the investigation of a criminal case initiated under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Battles") against a 32-year-old man, who hit a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of Culture and Recreation named Gorky, the suspect was selected a measure of restraint in the form of a subscription - not an endorsement."
The representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs added that an administrative protocol for non-compliance with the police had been drawn up in respect of the suspect.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast for the Day of the VDV to the correspondent came an unsatisfied man and hit his face.
As it turned out later, the hooligan has nothing to do with the VDV.
According to Razvozhayev himself, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarian citizens have been detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
According to the BBC, according to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tent parking.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people were detained in Sithonia, putting tents in an unoccupied place, including two Bulgarian citizens.
They were released on the same day, while the investigation is still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the TV channel "Bi-Ti-Vi" that Bulgarian citizens were then released.
The Greek authorities have tightened control over free camping and are already imposing serious fines on all those caught while parking in a place not intended for this purpose.
Inspections will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the Ministry, the court can impose a fine.
The Russian Foreign Ministry accused the Vice President of the United States of the rhetoric of the times of the "cold war"
Statements made during the European tour of U.S. Vice President Michael Pence were criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
“It is regrettable to note that Washington is increasingly gravitating towards the primitive ideological stamp of the Cold War era, which is completely detached from reality,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.
Thus, the Foreign Ministry responded to Pence’s words about the “Russian threat” and attempts to forcibly redraw the borders he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice "either with the West or with Russia" and the lack of clarity of the thesis about the supposedly unalternative entry of the whole of South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by applying force to repel Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another source of tension.
“We call on our American colleagues to stop shaming Russia and its foreign policy line, which is invariably based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests,” the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Feldscher was injured in an accident with a "rapid" in Moscow
The accident occurred in the Moscow Sub-Moscow Stupino, as a result of the collision of the foreign market with the ambulance carriage, the field marshal was injured.
Today at about 08:10 MSK there was a collision of a Mitsubishi car with an ambulance in the city of Stupino of the Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the car "quickly" turned over," TASS said in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Moscow region.
On the site of the accident are employees of law enforcement agencies, the circumstances of what happened are found out.
In the Odessa region, a woman threw on the construction of her newborn son, wrapped in a cellophane bag.
On the evening of August 3, a report was received to the Division of Police from a local resident that he had found a package with a baby in an unfinished private house.
“At the scene of the incident went law enforcement officers and doctors, who promptly took the child to a medical institution,” the Odessa chief of the National Police said in a statement.
Doctors determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of umbilical cord.
During the primary operational and follow-up activities, the identity of the 36-year-old local resident was established.
It is also found that the woman has three other minor children.
As noted in the chapter, in the field of law enforcement, the family had not previously been included and did not have a special account.
At present, the police are determining the circumstances and reasons that offered the woman to do so, after which a procedural decision will be made.
The baby is now under the supervision of doctors.
As reported earlier, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature child into the muzzle line.
Grigory Leps: "I'm going to fight, although 55 is not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage Grigory Leps next Sunday will celebrate his 55th birthday.
Before the celebration, the singer communicated with the observer "Izvestia".
I remember your "halfling" being marked.
A special tent in "Luzhniki", Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday party, a powerful salute over the Moscow River.
You must have been wondering how you'd like to spend your next five years.
Have your plans come true?
Speaking of the profession, it was a good time.
I worked a lot, toured the whole country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He has released two good albums.
Of course, I'm not what I was 20 years ago.
Biological clocks should not be fooled.
Singing the way I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
However, I’m struggling, I don’t want to stop.
And I'm with new people, I think I'm going to go to a different level.
You're recording a new album with them for the first time in three years.
Yeah, he's working on it now.
Actually, we've already recorded everything in my studio and now we're going to send him to Los Angeles for a briefing.
It's called "Why Are You So Serious?" from the song of the same name, which was co-written with Timati.
She's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put her anywhere yet.
We'll do it later when we get the video.
And we will present the album in November - to a series of my anniversary concerts in Moscow "Crocus City Hall".
To your new record, a cool American drummer, Chris Coleman, put his hand in it.
Do you think you wanted to bring him into your tour?
In my opinion, Coleman today is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world.
He came to me in the studio, recorded his games.
I offered him to join my band, and Jeremy Coulson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects – “News”) offered.
But for long-term work in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
The fees ranged from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>35,000 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,000 per month.
Then I thought that in the post-Soviet space I would find worthy musicians.
And I found a great drummer, Max Malyshev.
It is better to feed them.
Sometimes I want to get close to one of them, not for what.
For example, guitarist Fyodor Dosumov is highly quoted internationally.
It is written by Western music magazines, he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wye, listening to his play, said that "a new generation of guitarists has arrived, with a different performing technique."
Your album is in Los Angeles, American musicians are collaborating with you, but you can't still come to the United States?
Are you trying to lift that ban?
Now, to be honest, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers who deal with this issue.
As a musician, I am truly sorry that I can’t get to America.
I have said many times that I am studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful it is.
We don't fool them, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
For 70 years, our performers of popular music have not faced the tasks that have always been solved by American musicians.
They wanted to make the best sound possible.
I try to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the UK has refused me entry for ten years.
But I will still apply for a visa to the British Embassy every year to be allowed to go there again, and most importantly, to work there.
The rest of Europe is kind to me.
And in August, you're planning a concert in Monaco, not a custom one, but a poster one, right?
Yeah, there's a good Sporting Hall in Monte Carlo, and I've been there before.
We have now been invited again and, as far as I know, all the tickets for the concert have already been sold out.
The "Randeva Lyma Vaikula", which will start on July 20 in Jurmala, will you go?
She invited me, and of course I responded.
Lyma is a wonderful singer and a wonderful woman who knows how to give herself and a beautiful voice, and even a whisper.
After tours and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums of his songs in your discography.
When will the third come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done completely differently.
I want to record about 80-90 of Vysotsky’s songs in about the same file as he did himself.
Just a voice and a guitar.
No other arrangement.
I will be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to get involved in the album and Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum.
I talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so let's see how it turns out.
You and Boris Grebenshchikov's songs gradually entered your repertoire.
Maybe you'll record an album of his stuff later?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I crossed paths with him several times and asked: can I sing one or the other of his songs?
He replied, "Grigory, I write songs so they can be performed."
Please, try it, sing it.
It might be interesting to record such an album.
I do not have such a task yet, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I may make such a project.
Unless you focus entirely on the affairs of your production center.
I guess until you've realized his potential, signed contracts with all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers that I would dream of having under my wing, but they are independent, held people.
You mean Sergey Lazarev?
Sergey is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may not agree with his repertoire, but he is a professional and has his own development strategy.
And now in my center is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in Voice.
He and I have a contract and we work together.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be a pity if he does not reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to pick up his repertoire, I'm making clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, I cry to poets, sometimes their tracks get into the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
On the way out, they will get a recorded album, a few clips.
And then, if they want, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although, I'd be happy if any of them would make a commercial success and pay me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to cover up the oxygen to anyone.
Let everyone work, break through, prove as I once proved.
If tomorrow you are offered a tour of Ukraine and guaranteed entry to the country, will you go?
I'm still being invited.
These are mostly closed events.
As for the big tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, who, in his own opinion, flew to Syria on the same plane that crashed.
If tomorrow they say that you need to fly to some other point in the interests of the state, I will fly.
And I don’t care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that we have managed to do this with Ukraine.
Because I believe that we are one people and should be together.
I am sorry that this is unlikely to happen, at least in the near future.
I used to give 40-50 concerts in Ukraine for a year.
They met like nowhere else.
A very grateful audience.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik...
In Ukraine, a lot of gifted people, and it is a real pity that now they can not fully unleash their talent on a wide Russian audience.
Music should bring people together and entertain them.
I would like to invite some cool Ukrainian performer to Russia, for example, Slava Vakarchuk, and make a concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at the moment...
Andrei Okhlopkov transferred from the cosmodrome
As it became known, the technical director of the East Andrey Ohlopkov spaceport began work in the State Space Science and Production Center (SSCPC) named after Khrunichev.
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Vostochny Cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the management of the Center for the Exploitation of Land and Space Infrastructure (CENKI), he was transferred to the enterprise in Moscow Filya, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Ohlopkov will not have a shifter: the post of technical director will most likely be abolished, and the functionality will be deployed in the units of CENKI.
About the fact that the technical director of the Eastern and Deputy Director General of CENKI on technological development Andrey Ohlopkov went to work at the Khrunichev GKNPC, "U" told the top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as an employee of the government apparatus.
“He has been working in a new position for several weeks,” the industry’s “U” interlocutors said.
It was not possible to get an operational comment from CENKI on Thursday, and Mr. Ohlopkov himself was unavailable for comments.
However, the information "U" was officially confirmed in the GKNOC.
He decided to move to the position of director for coordination of production, - said at the enterprise. - Andrei Ohlopkov has fully fulfilled the task set before him to ensure the launch minimum for the first launch at the East cosmodrome.
Mr. Ohlopkov moved to work at CENKI in 2013, having served in the space forces, in particular at Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" cosmodrome, held the position of first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrey Ohlopkov became a member of the criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly from his filing, regional merchants received government orders for the rollback, but did not fulfill the obligations to clean up the separate parts of carrier rockets in the Arkhangelsk region and the Republic of Komi.
In 2012, the jury found him innocent.
The technological development responsibilities assigned to it by CENKI extended to different projects, but the main one was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
The head of the then Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, in an interview with “U” directly said that the situation in the East “was critical already in October 2013”.
The fact is that a strategic mistake was made during the planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 carrier rocket were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
To carry out the launch before the end of the year, the completion of the construction was decided six months earlier and the deadlines were shifted from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, it was necessary to go for a trick: the specialists of CENKI began to carry out parallel installation of technological equipment on unbuilt objects.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Ohlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and still the transfer (instead of December 2015 "Soyuz" flew only on April 28, 2016), this idea justified itself, says source "U" at the cosmodrome: "Otherwise, we would not have carried out any launches from the East, but would have been engaged in construction".
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversees the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly called Andrei Ohlopkov his "cosmic Susanin", but it was he who almost always asked for information about the progress of construction.
Mr. Okhlopkov remembered straight: for example, in an interview with "U", he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroy) of the status of the only contractor on the Eastern and directly work with subcontractors: "Why should we lay all the eggs in one basket?"
This idea was supported by the government.
Since 2017, CENKI has taken on the duties of a general contractor to complete the construction and installation work on the start-up and technical complex by the planned in the fourth quarter.
According to Y, the reason for Mr. Ohlopkov’s transition to a new place of work was disagreements with the leadership of CENKI about the ways to complete the construction of structures and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as methods of working with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be better for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the construction of the Eastern.
An employee of the government apparatus, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, finding him an equivalent replacement will not be easy."
According to "U", this will not be necessary: the post of technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be spread over the units of CENCI.
In music schools will be a program of study for two specialties
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Sviatoslav Golubenko, for this, students can re-read the repetitive discipline, and the issue with payment of the remaining classes in the second specialty to be solved with the help of special grants, reports RIA Novosti.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken control of this issue, and we will develop a mechanism together with the expert community that will allow you to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
Last Friday, in the course of the "Nedetsky Chat" Vladimir Putin with the pupils of the children's center "Sirius" student Maria Andreeva said that she was forced to pay for recurring subjects in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she is studying violin and piano and has awards competitions in both directions.
The head of state recognized her question as very relevant and promised to help.
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian man was detained on the wall of the skyscraper
In Mexico, 17-year-old Russian Kirill N., who climbed the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, is detained, reports the portal El Universal.
The incident took place in the capital of Mexico.
The young man, with the help of two unknown men, crossed a three-meter fence into the territory of the Nestle office building complex and climbed one of its towers on his own.
At the same time, he did not use any special equipment, insurance and ropes.
The young man was already on the roof.
Officials from the Ministry of Public Security put him on the ground in a helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Institute of Migration.
There, they find out whether the young man is legally on the territory of the country.
Meanwhile, a video of a young man climbing to the top has become popular on the Internet.
Users called the young man a "spider-man".
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help ease HVAC.
Red meat and chocolate are considered nightmares for your digestive tract.
But recent studies say the opposite: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help relieve symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases.
This incurable disease, which affects about 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, leads to colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Usually, to alleviate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers from the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid protein tryptophan contributes to the production of immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the intestines make sure that harmful microbes coming from food do not enter the body.
Cells that are able to trigger the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body and at the same time not harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too much disturbed in the direction of inflammation, this can lead to inflammatory bowel diseases.
Experiments have shown that mice that have a certain bacterium in the gut appear to increase the tolerance of the cell.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan — one of the building blocks of protein — to trigger the appearance of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have established a link between one species of bacteria — Lactobacillus reuteri — which is part of the normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan was contained in the mice’s diet, the more of these immune cells they had.”
He suggested that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet may contribute to a more tolerant and less prone to inflammation of the environment in the gut.
Postdoc Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barrag<0xC3><0xA1>nvas, studying the variety of immune cell tolerance, found that one group of test mice had these cells, and the other group, which belonged to the same line, but was contained separately, did not.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the gut microbiomes of mice — communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that typically live in the gastrointestinal tract.
The DNA of mouse intestinal cells was sequenced, and six species of bacteria were found present in mice that had immune cells but were absent in mice that did not.
The mice, grown in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cells, received L. reuteri, and immune cells appeared in them.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid medium and then transferred small portions of fluid—without bacteria—to underdeveloped immune cells secreted from mice.
Immune cells have become cells that increase tolerance.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of tryptophan processing, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice’s food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan level was reduced by half, the number of cells also dropped by double.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same cell tolerance as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is unknown whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans as well as in mice, but in people suffering from inflammatory bowel diseases, defects in the genes associated with tryptophan have been found.
She says, “Perhaps we need to strengthen the development of these cells, because inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestines depend on these cells.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri can potentially lead to an expansion of their population."
According to Jose Mourinho, “Manchester United” hired “genius” in the face of Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have hired “genius” in the face of Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho says after the midfielder made his debut in the match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, acquired for <0xC2><0xA3>40 million from Chelsea, started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in the last pre-season match against United ahead of the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and made an impression in the role of a midfielder, while Pogdebra.
However, as Matic did not take part in the pre-season Chelsea tour of Asia, he seriously lacked preparation for the game, and he lasted only 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires refinement before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius in how he thinks – he thinks football,” Mourinho said.
“We’ll help him get ready sooner rather than later.”
Just like Matic, his fellow newcomers Viktor Lindelof and Romela Lukaku started the game at Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began to form his core squad by the start of the next season.
The Independent newspaper reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club has already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he would like to hire in the first place.
“I am grateful to the club for having won three out of four,” he added.
“I’m even happier if they get me four out of four, but they’ve already done a lot for me.”
Former leaders of the Lithuanian Social Democrats agree to remain in the ruling coalition
The former presidents of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former prime ministers Algirdas Butkjavi<0xC4><0x8D>ius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as the former speaker of the Sejm from the Social Democrats, Cheslovas Jur<0xC5><0xA1>enas, appealed to the one-partyers to remain in the ruling koala.
As reported by the Parliamentary newspaper, due to tensions with partners - the Union of Peasants and "Greens" - the Social Democratic Party initiated a discussion on whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And here are the three senior experienced comrades addressed to the one-party with an open letter, which, in particular, says: "It is clear the disappointment of the comrades in the party with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the "citizens" created for us not very easy, but still the conditions for further implementation of the party's social goals, which are fair for us.
According to former party leaders, the discussion has so far “overwhelmed an emotion-based expression without concrete arguments.”
The authors of the letter fear that their party’s reckless actions could lead to political, economic and social instability in Lithuania.
The disabled Anton Mamaev was given a fine
The Moscow court eased the sentence of disabled wheelchair user Anton Mamaev from four and a half years in prison to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Earlier, by the decision of the Timiryazev court, the convicted person was released from the SIZO.
At the same time, the Mosgorsud confirmed that the accused is a criminal, because he organized the robbery and abduction of a scooter from a former special forces fighter.
By its decision, the Moscow court relaxed the punishment of Anton Mamaev to 200 thousand rubles. fine.
"Mamayev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms part of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal responsibility," said Ulyan Solopov, spokesman for the Moscow court.
In this case, the court took into account Mamaev's state of health, the facts of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which a punishment below the lower limit can be imposed.
As for Mamaev’s assistant Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish the circumstances that would be the basis for changing the category of severity of the sentence and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself said that he remained dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow court.
I'm disappointed with the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an excuse to continue fighting for justice.
His lawyer Andrey Orlov did not rule out the appeal of the sentence in the cassation instance of the Moscow court and the Supreme Court.
“We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights,” he told RIA Novosti.
Recall, 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamaev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a figurehead of the criminal case in the fall of last year.
The disabled person claims that he bought a scooter from friends for 160,000 rubles, to then sell.
However, the owners of the scooter, including a former special forces fighter, said that the disabled and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov seized their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years of the colony, and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years of imprisonment with serving a sentence in the colony of the general regime (under Part 2 of Article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the disabled person was placed in the SIZO, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General’s Office, the human rights commissioner under President Tatiana Moskalkova, joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July Anton Mamaev was released from SIZO by the decision of the same Timiryazev court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in the Moscow court.
The ONF will prepare a report on the environment for the President
The final “Forum of Action” of the All-Russian People’s Front (ONF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told Izvestiam and confirmed the head of the executive committee of the movement Alexei Anisimov.
According to him, according to the results of the forum, the "frontists" plan to prepare a report to the President on the problems of the domestic environment, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
The interlocutors of Izvestia in the ONF note that the report to the head of state will contain a "deep analysis" of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final forum of the ONF will be held in autumn.
The exact date of its conduct has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is adjusted to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally present at key events of the ONF.
The front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The result will be a conference in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia Ulan-Ude.
Based on the proposals that have been made and will be made at these events, we will form systematic proposals for solving environmental problems, - told "Izvestia" interlocutor in the ONF.
Co-chairman of the Central staff of the movement Olga Timofeeva, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, said that the “frontists” will inform the head of state about the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the “Forum of Action” of the ONF are likely to be combined.
Over the year, we grew up with a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental problems, saw gaps in the legislation, stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be part of the report that we are preparing for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "frontists" are also reporting on the work on priority projects of the ONF, - Olga Timofeeva told "Izvestiam".
According to her, a special representative of the head of state on environmental activities, ecology and transport Sergey Ivanov will be invited to the forum.
Previously, he had already participated in the work of the ONF Media Forum, which was held in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing to do today is to launch environmental mechanisms so that they work for many years.
So that these questions do not fall out of the agenda, - added Olga Timofeeva.
Andrei Kolyadin, Head of the Laboratory of Regional Policy of the Expert Institute of Social Research (EISI), noted that by raising environmental issues, the ONF operates in the direction of the presidential agenda.
Many things they offered as experts in various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the president, - said "Izvestiam" Andrei Kolyadin.
He stressed that to date, the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be excluded, which can give regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of ONF, regions will be able to lobby not only for the solution of their environmental problems, but also for the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by the “direct line” with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked about the garbage dump in Balashikha (already closed) and about the coal dust in the port of Nahodka (a bill on the prohibition of open coal transshipment in settlements has already been developed, one of the authors is Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole is created, the issue is in the further law-enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
We need a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the state, - believes the head of the charity foundation "Ecology for All" Leonid Bochin.
Sergey Tsyplenkov, member of the HRH, head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace of Russia, in a conversation with Izvestia, stressed that a responsible approach of society and business is needed to successfully solve environmental problems, and there are few legislative efforts.
As soon as society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergey Tsyplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to break the trend to the fact that the violation of environmental legislation is an economically advantageous solution for business.
The British inventor used a microchip to get into the house and car at the stroke of a hand
The British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could open the door of his house, enter the office and even start the car with a simple swipe of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam has implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger and now, through his firm BioTek, offers this service to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives at the expense of technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, an anesthesiologist-consultant from Royal in Winchester, to ensure that the implantation procedure was carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip that is fed to cats and dogs, and the procedure takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also replaces locks in homes and cars with chip-compatible locks at a price of <0xC2><0xA3>300 per lock.
The married father of one child has already installed the technology in his home and in his BMW Z4, which is launched when his hand is on the steering wheel.
Requisite for the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to military records provided to TIME magazine, the White House’s decision last month to bring a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn at an event dedicated to U.S. industrial production cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as “Marine One” when the president is on board, became a central element of the July 17 White House event that showcased U.S. construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials reviewed technology products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a truckloader from Mississippi.
According to the records of the First Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the department in charge of the helicopter management, the White House Military Department ordered the presence of the helicopter in a private order, or “FRAGO”, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the southern runway by accident.
“I just wanted you to make sure you’re aware because this is an unusual, widely publicized event,” the HMX-1 commander wrote in an email to his chief, the Marine Corps’ first deputy chief of aviation, on the eve of the event.
The letter indicated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Meadow at about 7 a.m. on July 17 to participate in an event scheduled for 3 a.m. and would remain there until the lawn was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. on the same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be required for the return flight in accordance with the restrictions on working hours.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, and the security personnel of the unit remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the records obtained by TIME magazine, it remains unclear whether the second crew was required in the end.
Hatch's law prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 specified whether the event contradicted this resolution.
“Among other things, we asked if it was a violation of Hatch’s law, and we were told not to,” the commander wrote.
“You don’t seem to have anywhere to go,” the deputy chief replied.
The event “Made in America” was announced by the White House as an official event, and Hatch’s law did not apply to it.
But even official events have political notes.
During the event, the President made efforts to advance the health care reform that was being drafted in the Senate at the time, and praised the attempts to regulate government decrees.
The use of aircraft known as “Marine One” and “Air Force One” for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But to ask them only in the interests of photo opportunity is unusual.
Trump has already been the subject of discussions in February, when the presidential plane drove in the background during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with reports of complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is delighted with the 'Made in America' show, which showcased products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials," White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said in a statement.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington agglomeration and on the South Lawn to train the U.S. president’s transportation to the White House with an accuracy of up to one inch.
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight made for the event “Made in America” was counted to the crew on account of the necessary training flights for a month.
The unit’s helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of “non-presidential support tasks.”
According to the White House, taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits presented at the event.
A representative of the company "Sikorsky" said that the company did not participate in the organization of the demonstration of the helicopter on the southern meadow.
HMX-1 does not take into account the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Department of Defense’s hourly rates for the 2017 fiscal year, the Department of Defense’s refund rate for VH-3D is $24,380 per hour of flight.
In the records of the unit, it was recorded that the time of the aircraft in the air was 30 minutes in each direction from its airfield based at the Quantico Marine Air Base in Virginia.
The White House says the actual cost of using the helicopter is well below that rate.
“Calculating the value for taxpayers based on the approximate rate of compensation is completely wrong,” says Walters.
“These approximate rates include staffing, maintenance, and many other non-repayable costs that are included in annual appropriations.”
According to a study conducted in 2015 by REND Corporation, the reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but, indeed, take into account the cost of fuel, services and costs specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer advocated using a helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to demonstrate this week things done in America,” Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suppose, hundreds if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to create.
So, of course, it is appropriate to pay attention to this.”
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while inspecting the Southern Lawn during the event, but he certainly sat in the driver’s seat in a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of Sikorsky, joking with the press about his own fleet of products.
“I know Sikorsky very well,” the president said, “I have three of them.”
Moscow will allocate grants for the resuscitation departments of city hospitals
Every year, grants "Saving lives" will be awarded to resuscitation and intensive care departments of capital clinics.
Funds are being made to encourage doctors and nurses.
The Mayor of Moscow Sergey Sobyanin visited the City Clinical Hospital named after Yudin.
During the examination of the clinic, he handed a thank-you letter to the traumatologist-orthopedist Viktor Protsko, under whose guidance the most complex operation on the reconstruction of the adolescent's foot was carried out.
Sergey Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to allocate grants to intensive care and intensive care units of urban clinics annually.
The funds will be directed to the promotion of doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of the capital, the clinical hospital named after Yudina is one of the largest in Moscow today.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment, allowing its doctors to carry out unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Kolomenskoye rural hospital.
Currently, the departments of the medical institution are designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to the resuscitation and the hospital, there are daily wards here.
The staff of the hospital is 2,800.
The total area occupied by the clinic is 23.7 ha.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in a pilot project on the organization of short-term stay inpatients (SCP).
They are designed to carry out relatively small operations.
In the process of surgical interventions, advanced medical equipment is used, allowing to significantly reduce the time of rehabilitation of patients.
After surgery in the hospital, they spend only a few hours.
In the first half of this year alone, 36 thousand patients were provided with inpatient care at Yudina Clinical Hospital.
The clinic’s medical staff performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported the absence of buyers of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported no applications for the purchase of the Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank.
This was reported by TASS on Friday, August 4, with reference to the representative of the press service of the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Victor Prokopeni for the approval of the indirect (through Paritetbank) acquisition of 100 percent of the shares of Sberbank was withdrawn.
"Documents from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank shares in the NBU have not been received," the statement said.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenia withdrew the application for the purchase of the subsidiary structure of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused to Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov in the acquisition of the Ukrainian “daughter” of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that the businessmen did not provide the necessary documents to verify their compliance with the requirements of the legislation of Ukraine.
Sberbank reported the sale of its Ukrainian “daughter” to Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the “daughters” of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are forbidden to withdraw capital from the country in favor of the mother organizations.
Trailer of the third season of "Narco": in the popular series of the studio "Netflix" after the death of Pablo Escobar the central role is played by the cartel Kali
Despite the fact that in the second season of "Narco" was revealed the identity of the killer Pablo Escobar, the series of the studio "Netflix" is far from complete.
The streaming service has already confirmed that the third and fourth seasons are planned, and the third has already been presented with the first trailer showing the villains of the upcoming show.
In the third season, the attention of the Drug Control Agency attracted the richest organization of drug traffickers - the Kali cartel.
The organization, led by powerful godfathers, operates like a Fortune 500 corporation, only with a large number of government bribes and acts of violence.
The leader of the cartel is Hilberto Rodriguez Orehuela (Dami<0xC3><0xA1>n Alca<0xC3><0xA7>ar), Miguel Rodriguez Orehuela (Francisco Denis) is her brain, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of communications with Mexico, and Chepe Santacruz-Londono (Pepe Rapa) is in charge.
In the recently released trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Pe<0xC3><0xB1>a, a character who enlists U.S. and Colombian law enforcement agencies to help in the war on drugs.
Other new cast members include Matthias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Willan, Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bische and Arturo Castro.
The third season of Narco will hit the screens on September 1.
Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN said.
The elections can only be representative if all members of society, including women, participate in them, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicolas Haysom, the current head of the UN mission to help Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are fighting for the post of vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
“The role of women cannot be overestimated,” he said in a statement on Wednesday.
The choice can only be fully representative when women are fully involved in them and involved in all stages of the electoral process.
Elections to the provincial councils and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban is threatening to disrupt the election process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to the role of advisers.
In this year’s elections, power is moving peacefully from one democratically elected government to another for the first time.
Haysom said that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, out of a total of 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.
The Prosecutor General's Office has approved the indictment in the case of Nikita White
The Prosecutor General’s Office of Russia has approved an indictment in a criminal case against the former governor of the Kirov region, Nikita White, accused of receiving a large bribe.
This was reported on Thursday, August 3, in the department, reports RIA Novosti.
The materials were transferred to the Presnensky District Court of Moscow for consideration on the merits.
In Venice, stricter fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venetian authorities have tightened fines for bathing in canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
For walks around the city in a swimsuit or with a naked torso will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros will be required from those who arrange a picnic in a public place or ride a bicycle in pedestrian areas, reports TASS with reference to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.
In addition, it is mentioned that the authorities provide a fine for inscriptions on monuments 400 euros and for waste 25 euros.
Informing tourists about the need to comply with the rules of conduct in Venice will be with the help of a special company "Enjoy, respect Venice" (#EnjoyRespectVenice) in social networks, as well as through ads and posters on the website of the city council, on billboards and in places of the largest concentration of tourists.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to Venice Tourism Advisor Paolo Mar, information about the fines will be transferred to the embassies of the offending countries, in order to warn their compatriots of such errors.
“The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach,” she said.
In April, the administration of the Italian city announced plans to limit tourist traffic.
Venice is already successfully operating a restriction on the number of tourists visiting the city center.
Instead of 100,000 people wishing to observe the Festa del Redentore festival, only 60,000 guests were allowed to the venue.
In addition, a moratorium on the creation of new hotels and fast food restaurants in the historic part of Venice has been introduced.
In the first half of 2017, officials of the State Border Service detained 272 illegal migrants at the border with the EU countries; a total of 1,059 illegal migrants were detained.
This was reported to the State Border Service.
Of these, 314 people were detained for illegal border crossing, while the rest were detained for violations of the rules of residence of foreigners in Ukraine and other crimes.
The largest number - 717 illegal migrants were detained on the border with Moldova.
At the border with the EU countries, 272 illegals were detained, most of them on the border with Slovakia, Poland, Hungary and Romania.
According to statistics, among the detained illegal migrants are mainly citizens of Moldova, Russia, Georgia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, Bangladesh, Vietnam, India and Armenia.
In addition, almost 2,000 potential illegal migrants were not allowed into Ukraine.
In the EU, we have found an unusual way to get rid of migrants.
Jazz in "Skolkovo": experiment and improvisation
The program of the second Skolkovo Jazz Science Festival, which will be held on August 26 at the Skolkovo Innovation Center, has been announced.
Guests are expected to perform by leading jazz groups and soloists, scientific discussions, interactive venues and other music-intellectual events.
As the organizers promise, the site will become a territory of improvisation and a field to demonstrate new creative opportunities.
“The guests of the festival will be able to immerse themselves in the world of experimental media technologies and learn how innovations in science become a new tool for interaction with art”, – Elena Zelentsova, Vice-President of the Skolkovo Foundation, described the focus of the forum.
Among the participants of Skolkovo Jazz Science 2017 are many stars, including the Moscow Jazz Orchestra of Igor Butman, who will present a joint program with vocalist Yaroslava Simonova.
Jazz and science are related concepts, and it is no coincidence that they have come together, - explained the folk artist "Izvestiam".
The experiment and improvisation of jazzmen are valued as highly as the scientists.
One of the main events of the festival will be the performance of Azekel, a British of Nigerian origin, known both for his own creativity and for his joint work with the legendary Massive Attack and Gorillaz.
Fans of the first jazz in Russia are looking forward to the performance of five-time Grammy Award nominee, pianist Christian Sands (USA) with his trio.
In the new capacity will try one of the best academic chamber orchestras "Music of Viva" under the leadership of Alexander Rudin and with the participation of pianist Yuri Favorin.
The fusion of jazz, ethnic and electronic music, as well as academic traditions will be demonstrated by the Marimba Plus ensemble and its leader, composer and marimba performer Lea Slepner.
One of the most unusual festival performances promises to be the set of the winner of the award Sergey Kurekhin Anton Maskeliadze.
An experimental artist manages music and video with gestures – that’s how leap motion technology works.
In total, eight music groups will perform on two stages of the festival.

He explained his decision by the need for rotation and his desire to “change the rhythm of life”.
The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not an instant one.

Electricity is cheaper for both residents and commodity producers of Buryatia
The efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers have been paying off for more than a decade.
Since September 1, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Decree of the Government of the Russian Federation "On Amendments to the Rules of the Wholesale Market of Electricity and Power and to the Consolidated Forecast Balance of Production and Supply of Electricity (Power) within the Unified Energy System of Russia for the Subjects of the Russian Federation" (No.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat commodity producers is reduced by a quarter, which will greatly facilitate the life of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For decades, the leaders of the republic have broken the thresholds of the Moscow cabinets in vain attempts to level the region in tariffs from the neighboring Irkutsk region with a cascade of hydroelectric plants on Angara, flowing from Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buryat.
It was only this year that the movement began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles/kWh to 3.93 rubles/kWh, or 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the List of territories of wholesale market price zones, for which the peculiarities of the functioning of wholesale and retail markets are established, a turn of industrial consumers has occurred.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, since the population of the Irkutsk region pays per kilowatt hour 1.01 rubles.
But no one dares to name at least the approximate date of the new tariff movements in the direction of the decline for Buryatia.

The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment at McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The union is demanding guarantees from the managers of McVitie’s cookie maker in connection with its long-term commitment to manufacturing at the Glasgow plant.
The Scottish branch of GMB reports that the company has been silent on the issue of future investments at the Tolkien facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, cookies Hobnobs and Rich Tea, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie’s, said it had invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in the facility over the past few years.
The company adds that in the event of any changes in the work of the facility, employees and representatives of the trade union “learn about them first.”
In a letter to the head of the facility owned by the company, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded McVitie's response to concerns that funding would not be allowed to upgrade production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy said: “The members of our union are deeply concerned that we cannot get clarity from the facility’s general manager on business needs and the investment plan for the future of Tolcross.”
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is great in local society and in Greater Glasgow; it is the most important pillar of decent work in the territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
Thus, from the point of view of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, the rise of the subsistence minimum and the chronic decline of production, East End Glasgow desperately needs the prosperity of production at McVitie's factory.
According to a representative of Pladis, “The head of the Tolkien facility only yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of GMB, and the company will respond immediately, as we appreciate our constant cooperation with the employees and representatives of the union.”
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with GMB employees and representatives in Tolkros, where we openly discussed a number of issues.
We talked to employees about how all companies operating in the most competitive and unstable economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions – and this applies to all our facilities and activities – to remain competitive.
“In recent years, we have invested more than <0xC2><0xA3>5 million in our Tolcros facility, especially in production lines and improved functional performance.”
We are fully aware of the value of Tolkros as a production facility, and in case of any changes in work at this facility, employees and representatives of the trade union will be the first to know about this.”
Putin said that the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the Cabinet should connect to the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNHC), but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, like Rosneft.
Thus, Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to the request of Igor Sechin to assist in resolving the conflicts that have arisen.
The Head of State noted that the relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be resolved exclusively on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, at a meeting on the implementation of large investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District, said that the lack of agreement with Gazprom on gas for VNHK endangers the project implementation period.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
“Gazprom offers to find gas resources from the perimeter of Rosneft, but we do not have such resources,” Sechin added.
Rosneft has asked for permission to use gas from the Kirin field of Gazprom, located on the Sakhalin shelf, for the Eastern Petrochemical Company.
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on the issue are ongoing, and “there are no sharp corners there.”
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar’s move three years ago?
La Liga player may regret his interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain won’t stop chasing Neymar after the club offered <0xC2><0xA3>189m for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of a world record-setting attack three years ago?
The sensational offer brought the summer transfer window to life when the League 1 club was ready to break the world record for the cost of the transition, more than twice the previous mark associated with Pogba’s return to Manchester United last season for <0xC2><0xA3>89 million.
When the transition is complete, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world, as well as the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of more than <0xC2><0xA3>500,000 a week net.
It is known that Barcelona are furious at how the offer was made and how Neymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, according to a source close to the Catalan club's leadership, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his transition from Santos in 2013.
But wasn’t the football world warned about this possibility three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in hiring Blaise Matthews in 2014, Nasser Al-Helaify issued a stern warning to any club that would like to lure one of PSG’s top players.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will stand up against them, we will make offers to their players,” he said.
“We treat all clubs with respect.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, they will have consequences.”
It seems that Barcelona crossed this line when the Spanish club expressed interest in the midfielder from PSG Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG has made it clear that they will not release an Italian player on any terms, and now Barcelona is probably feeling the consequences of their offer in the form of the loss of one of their most valuable players, Neymar.
Putin has instructed to deal with the payments of victims of forest fires.

“In this regard, I would also like to ask the relevant colleagues about how much money has been allocated,” Putin said at a meeting with leaders of the regions located in Baikal.
On August 4, Vladimir Putin visited the Baikal State Natural Biosphere Reserve.

They talked about the work on cleaning the lake.
Then showed the young in an open container next to the container, which was prepared for breeding.
At first, Putin released a few boys from the sack.
Then pulled a special lever on the lid of the container and released the rest.
Also during the trip, the leader instructed to deal with the environmental situation on Baikal and to build a road on the island of Olkhon.
According to the Ministry, one volume is required, and another volume is allegedly provided.
“I want to deal with what is actually happening there with funding,” the Russian leader said.
We will remind, during the forest fires of 2017 were covered by fire the settlements of Buryatia, Irkutsk region, were destroyed residential houses and economic buildings.

In an interview with Komsomolskaya Pravda, the Russian singer called Manson a “disgusting” and a “bitch.”
According to Loza, foreign artists who allow themselves such statements do not need to be invited to Russia.
In addition, Loza believes that Manson for his words needs to "give in the morgue".
