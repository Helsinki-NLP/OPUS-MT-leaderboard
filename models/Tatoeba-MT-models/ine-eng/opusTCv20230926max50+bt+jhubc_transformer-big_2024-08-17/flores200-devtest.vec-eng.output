It's still happening right now, but the most important thing is that its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format actually xe, so a bit confusing, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing a pair of twelve pairs to obtain the ratio with the whole number plus a simple number) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS group of formats) are the same or similar to this aspect ratio.

Ancient China provided a unique way of showing the various periods of the year: the phase of China or any fame that generates at the command generates a distinct dynasty.
In addition, between each dynasty there is a period of little peace with the divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is that of the Three Kingdoms which will last for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there was little fear among the various nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms is one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, with the deaths of thousands of people fighting to sit in the highest place of the great palace in Xi'an.

Technological determinism has many ideas, including the technological push or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by ‘a basic logic along with the laws of the senses and the manifestations of all technology.
So many inter-interpretations of technological determinism share the idea: the svi<0xC5><0x82>upo dea technol<0xC3><0xB3>gia itself follows a path that goes from cultural or political influence, and from counter-technology to the "effects" of its societies that the inherent xé invests that socially conditioning.
For example, one might say that the motor of the car brings force to the winding of the roads.
However, in a network of national roads, there is no economically viable solution for some machines, so there are new production methods that are developed to reduce the cost of having a machine.
Having so many machines leads to so many accidents on its roads, and costo leads to the invention of nine medical techniques to cure the harmful bodies.

As Paris is now known for being the capital of fashion, Constantinople is the capital of the fashion of feudal Europe.
It is known as the center of luxury from 400 to 1100.
It is believed that in the 12th century, the Crusaders would return to the sea and produce more money than the Byzantine goods they were offering.
It was during this period that the title of Capital del Lusso passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
In the beginning, the Gera costume was strongly influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to the slow communication channels, the western styles of gabar<0xC3><0xAC>a can remain indrio for 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe tried to develop its own style. One of the greatest changes of the era was that, following the Crusades, people tried to dress up the buttons themselves.
Food production is the process by which food is produced in order to satisfy the needs of the farmer and to satisfy his hunger.

While learning based on self-projects would have to make learning more phased and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.

The Internet brings together elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
And different characteristics of the Internet and it brings other dimensions of use and appreciation to the gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" were suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al. 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous reporting" are identified as motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigate and react to the public's reactions to websites.

To equip ships to transport goods by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The concept of marine xe has traditionally been to ensure that we retain the ability to move our own people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the recent exceptions to ‘this stuff is worth noting is the canpagna of the North Atlantic of the Second World War. The Americans made a hearty effort to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to the United Kingdom.
At the same time, the crucian navy, which was using the U-boats, was responsible for stopping this traffic.

Periodic rhythms, which do not simply respond to external periodic ideas, are documented by most living beings, including bats, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological reoji are self-sufficient oscillators that will give you a period of free cycle without external ideas.
The Hershey and Chase xe experiment is one of the main suggestions that DNA generates made of genetic material.

It is said that as soon as this massive carbon economy moves the biosphere from one of its stable states to support human evolution in the last few million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the means of transport. Almost everyone complains about the means of transport.
In developing countries, it is rare to hear complaints about the quality of the water or the bridges that fall.
Why do the transport vehicles get so many complaints, why do they have problems every day? Transport engineers don't understand them? Is there a fundamental problem that follows?
The traffic flow is the study of the movement of driving singles and vehicles between points and the interaction between them.
Unfortunately, he studied the flow of traffic because the behavior of those who drive can not be predicted with certainty.
Fortunately, those who lead tend to find in you a reasonably consistent limit; moreover, the currents of traffic tend to have a reasonable consistency and are largely represented mathematically.
To represent the flow of traffic, there are three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
