Politicians in Wales afraid of ‘like fools’
There was dismay among some members of the Welsh National Assembly over a proposal to change their title to MWPs (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
It has arisen because of plans to change the Assembly's name to Welsh Parliament.
AMs from across the political spectrum are concerned that the name change could lead to ridicule.
A Labour member said his group was concerned because "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp".
To readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means shit.
A member of the Plaid Cymru party said the group as a whole was "not satisfied" and had suggested alternatives.
A Welsh conservative said his group was "open" to the name change, but noted that there is only a short verbal jump from the MWP to the Muppet (foolish).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced in the same way as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a bill to introduce the name changes, said: "The final decision on the designations that Members of Parliament will receive is of course up to the Members themselves."
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh National Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation of the proposals, with broad support for calling the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
With regard to the title of AMs, the Commission preferred Welsh Parliament Members (Wales MPs) or WMPs, but the MWP option received the greatest support in a public consultation.
AMs seem to suggest alternative options, but the struggle to reach agreement may prove difficult for Assembly Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to draft a bill on the changes within a few weeks.
The reform bill contains other changes to the way the Assembly works, including rules on the disqualification of AMs and the composition of the committee system.
The AMs get the final vote on what to call them when the bill is debated.
Macedonians hold vote to change country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The vote is being held in an attempt to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a claim on the territory of Greece and has long protested Macedonia's attempts to become a member of the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov is opposed to the vote and says he will undermine the vote.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply a price paid to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The bells in St. Martin's are going silent, while the churches in Harlem are fighting.
“The older people I’ve spoken to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner,” Mr. Adams said.
"Today there are none of the parts."
He said it's understandable that the bars are disappearing.
“People socialize in other ways these days,” he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood's living quarters, where people walk in on a daily basis."
In relation to churches, he worries that the money raised to sell assets will not last long, and that they "sooner or later are back where they started".
He adds that churches could be replaced by apartment complexes that are full of the kind of people who don’t help the neighborhood’s recurring temptations.
"The overwhelming majority of people who buy condos in these buildings are white," he says, "and it breathes further into the development where these churches eventually close completely because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into the condos will become members of the churches."
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martin’s a decade later.
The original Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black congregation that had functioned nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation under the pastor John Howard Johnson, who was at the head of a boycott of shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, which would not hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when Father Johnson’s parishioners made plans to restore the building, they ordered the clockwork.
The priest David Johnson, Johnson’s son and successor in St. Martin’s, proudly called the bells “the bells of the poor.”
The expert who played the bell in June called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the first clock game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to the larger clock game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's couldn't find a replacement for him.
What has unfolded in St. Martin's over the past few months has been a complicated tale of architects and contractors, some of whom were picked up by church leaders, others by the diocese.
The parish council – the parish’s governing body, which consists of leading laymen – wrote in July to the diocese about concerns that the diocese would “try to push the expenses forward” to the parish council, even though the parish council had not been involved in hiring the architects and contractors that the diocese sent in.
Some of the congregation members complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark injures 13-year-old on lobster dive in California
A shark attacked and wounded a 13-year-old boy Saturday as he dived for lobsters in California on the first day of the lobster season, officials say.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and then along with a group paddled over to him to help him out of the water.
Hammel says that he thought it was just excitement to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was shouting, "I was bitten!
I was bitten!”
"His whole collarbone was torn up," said Hammel, he saw when he reached the boy.
"I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is reported to be in critical condition.
It is not known what kind of shark was attacked.
Lifeguard Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was not considered a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to his upper torso.
Officials closed access to the beach on the stretch from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for safety reasons and to conduct investigations.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 sharks in the area, but that most are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the beauty market in the UK
Sainsbury's takes the competition up with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with rows of beauty products with special assistants in the style of department stores.
As part of a major effort to enter the UK beauty market, which has a value of <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow while fashion and home products decline. The larger ranges of beauty products are tested in 11 stores around the country and launched in several stores next year if they prove to be successful.
The investment in beauty products comes as supermarkets look for new products for shelves that were previously used for televisions, microwaves and home products.
Sainsbury’s says they are doubling their range of beauty products to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw, which are being introduced for the first time.
The existing assortments from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees also get more space with branded areas in the style of those seen in stores like Boots.
The supermarket also relaunches a range of Boutique makeup, so the majority of products are suitable for vegans – something that is increasingly required by younger shoppers.
In addition, the fragrance shop Fragrance Shop is testing stalls in two Sainsbury's stores. The first opened in Croydon in the southern part of London last week, and the second opens in Selly Oak in Birmingham later in the year.
Online shopping and a trend towards buying small amounts of food daily from local merchants means supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit them.
Mike Coupe, director of Sainsbury’s, has said that the stores will look like department stores, as the supermarket chain takes up the fight with discount chains Aldi and Lidl by introducing more services and goods that are not food.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also introduced a number of Habitat outlets since they bought both chains two years ago. These measures have strengthened their grocery sales and made the acquisitions more profitable.
The supermarket’s previous attempts to update beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with Boots in the early 00s, but the collaboration ended in a dispute over how to distribute the profits from the pharmacies in the supermarkets.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold their pharmacy chain with 281 stores to Celesio, which owns the chain Lloyds Pharmacy, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 three years ago.
According to the strategy, Lloyds will play a role in the plan by adding an additional range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury’s Commercial Director, said: “We have changed the look and feel of our ranges of beauty products to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues who will be available to give advice.
Our range of brands is designed to fit all needs and the ingesting environment and convenient locations mean that we are now a compelling destination that challenges the old way of shopping.”
Peter Jones 'infuriated' after Holly Willoughby pulls out of deal at <0xC2><0xA3>11m
Dragons' Den star Peter Jones left "infuriated" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulls out of deal for <0xC2><0xA3>11 million with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby does not have time for their residential product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to the Gwyneth Paltrow Goop brand.
This Morning host, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she is leaving the project.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons’ Den star Peter Jones furious after she pulls out of their lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute – to focus on her own new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was “stunning” when the popular TV woman during a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new deals – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – meant she no longer had enough time for their residential product and accessories brand Truly.
The company had been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and was tipped to double Willoughby’s estimated fortune of <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
Willoughby, 37, went on Instagram to announce that she was leaving Truly while Jones was flying out of the UK to one of her holiday homes.
A source said: “Truly, one of Holly’s top priorities.
It should have been a long-term project that she would have to deal with for the next few decades.
Her decision to withdraw surprised everyone involved.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to launch.
There is a warehouse full of goods at the Marlow headquarters, which is already ready for sale.”
Experts estimate that the announcement from This Morning host, which is among the UK’s highest-earning stars, could cost the company millions due to large investments in products – ranging from pillows to candles to clothing and home products – and the potential for further delays in launch.
This could be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin has had a close relationship with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, took over as Chairman of the Board in March.
The two couples go on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of the shares in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will serve as the brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, “We could not comment on his business ventures.”
Hard talk, "and then we fell in love"
He made fun of the criticism he would receive from the news media to make a comment that "is not a worthy president" and to be so positive towards the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his parody at a news conference.
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim is interested in a meeting more after Trump declared their first meeting in Singapore in June as a major step toward nuclear-freezing North Korea.
But the nuclear-freezing negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea’s top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea does not see a “similar reaction” from the United States in relation to North Korea’s initial crackdown on disarmament.
He noted that the United States is instead continuing with sanctions aimed at keeping the pressure running.
Trump took a more optimistic view of the speech at his election rally.
“North Korea is doing very well,” he said.
“There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people could have been killed.
Now we have an amazing relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had produced positive results – ending missile tests, helping with the release of hostages and returning the remains of U.S. military personnel.
And he defended his unusual approach to Kim.
“It’s so easy to behave stately, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this tight-knit arena, we’d have about 200 people standing there,” Trump said.
Indonesian Tsunami and Earthquake Devastates Island, Kills Hundreds
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, non-governmental organisations were informed that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 per cent of Lombok's population was homeless, no national state of disaster was declared, which is a prerequisite for calling for international emergency aid.
“In many cases, unfortunately, it has been clear that they are not asking for international assistance, so it is a bit challenging,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain whether foreign employees can work in the field.
Mr Sutopo, spokesman for the National Disaster Response Force, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Because of the earthquakes to which Indonesia is constantly exposed, the country is very poorly prepared for natural disasters.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but they are not a common sight on other coastlines.
A warning had been issued in Palu, but a tsunami was apparently missing, and it has likely affected the death toll.
Even in the best of conditions, it is challenging to travel between the many islands of Indonesia.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that has been in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made Indonesia’s inadequate infrastructure a central point in his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and train routes.
But Mr Joko's administration has been plagued by a lack of funding in line with the election campaign next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from underlying sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have taken on a more conservative form of faith.
Over 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands removed from their homes as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with machetes, bow and arrow and other primitive weapons.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge equalizes at the last minute against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with a score in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge received an interception from Xherdan Shaqiri small 30 meters from Chelsea's goal, while his team was behind 1-0.
He pointed to the ball with his left foot before making a high shot towards the farthest post.
The ball flew high above the field towards the top right corner of the net.
The ball dropped over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and fell into the net.
“It was just about getting in the position to get the ball. Players like Shaq are always trying to get as far forward as possible, so I was trying to give myself as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw that Kante came and I made a single touch. I didn't think much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led 1-0 at the semi-finals, after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Chelsea forward turned his heel back to Mateo Kovacic before setting the pace in the midfield and sprinting into Liverpool's half of the field.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in midfield.
He then made a long pass that led Hazard into the field.
Hazard ran from the defence and ended up on the farthest post with a shot with his left foot past Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15:00 on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Indonesia's tsunami death toll rises to 832
The death toll from Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, according to the country’s disaster preparedness early Sunday.
Many were reported trapped in the rubble of buildings that fell after the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale. It hit on Friday and created up to 6 meters high waves, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was covered by rubble from collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after woman stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found with a stab wound at 7:55 am at Grayson Mews on John Street. A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area who saw or heard anything to step forward.
Police Assistant Brian O'Hagan said: "We are in the early stages of the investigation, but I would encourage anyone who stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I would also encourage everyone, especially taxi drivers who may have recorded something with dashcam, to contact us as they may have information that may be crucial to the investigation.”
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from the Birkenhead area and that she was found inside a property.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues, and police say they are in the process of informing the victim's relatives.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to enter his apartment, but is told by police that no one is allowed to enter the building.
He was stunned when he heard what had happened.
Residents will now be told that it will be several hours before they can enter again.
A police officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman arrives.
She keeps saying, "It's so terrible."
At 2 p.m., there were two police cars inside the checkpoint and another car just outside.
A number of police officers were inside the fence and monitored the apartment complex.
Anyone with information should write a message directly to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111 and provide log 247 on September 30.
Parliament's statue of Cromwell becomes the latest memorial to be hit by discussion of "rewriting history"
The removal would be poetic justice for his Taliban-like destruction of so many of England’s cultural and religious artifacts carried out by his fanatical, Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "madness" and an "attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “It was inevitable in the current debate on the removal of statues that the figure of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace at Westminster would become a target.
The image storm during the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell is sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft’s stunning depiction of Cromwell is a testament to 19th-century attitudes and part of the historiography of a figure that many still believe is worth paying tribute to.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more at the end of the 19th century than today, as a defender of Parliament against outside pressure, in his case pressure from the monarchy.
Whether it is an accurate depiction is subject to ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is one recognisable figure who represents one side of the struggle.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of tribute and remembrance."
Chinese Farmer Attacks and Kills Chinese Farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China, according to local media reports.
The man, identified only by his last name "Yuan", was found dead with an exaggerated pulse wound and smeared in blood near a pig market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer is preparing to give pig vaccines at a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the pigsty next door was open.
He said there was a large ore in the pig's stone with blood in its mouth.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 250 kg pig had bitten the farmer to death, according to the report.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and injured,” said the cousin, who goes by the surname “Wu,” in a quote from Guiyang Evening News.
Footage from security cameras showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked away to prevent it from attacking others while police collect evidence at the scene.
It is reported that Yuan's family and market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
It belongs to the rarities, but there are previously recorded cases where pigs have attacked humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their Massachusetts farm and left the man with serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a pig weighing 295 kg was masturbating a Welsh farmer against his tractor, until his wife scared the animal away.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just sick.
Those naps, they're very curious... they're not going to hurt you.
You just have to treat them with respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to provide heavy rain in much of the southwestern United States.
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa is getting weaker as it moves over the cooler water off Mexico’s northern coast.
However, Rosa will provide heavy rains with flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States over the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 38 m/s, a Category 1 hurricane, at 10 a.m. on Sunday (Danish time) and was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia in Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
As Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, it begins to push tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States, with the Pacific Ocean moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States.
Rosa will provide up to 254 mm of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture will interact with the low-pressure outlet that is coming closer, creating heavy rain in the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Locally, 25 to 101 mm of rain will create dangerous storm surges, liquid precipitation and possibly landslides in the desert.
The tropical humidity will create rainfall of up to 51 to 76 mm per hour locally, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 51 to 101 mm of rain is expected in parts of the southwestern United States, especially over large parts of Arizona.
Storm floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions are highly likely due to the scattered nature of tropical rains.
It would be a very bad idea to move out into the desert on foot when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can turn canyons into roaring rivers and thunder will create strong local winds and create dust gusts.<0x3C>/seg>
The approaching low-pressure vent will provide heavy rain along the coast in parts of southern California.
There is a risk of a total precipitation of more than 13 mm, which may result in smaller amounts of liquid precipitation and slippery roads.
This would be the region’s first rainfall in their rainy season.
Scattered tropical rain showers will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday and spread more late Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners area on Tuesday and continue on Wednesday.
In October there may be large temperature fluctuations throughout the United States, as the Arctic gets cooler, but there remains fairly warm in the tropics.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature over short distances.
There is a good example of dramatic temperature differences across the central U.S. on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of nearly 11 degrees between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa.
Over the next few days, the remaining summer heat will try to build up and expand again.
Large parts of the central and eastern United States are expected to experience a warm start in October with temperatures above 26 degrees from the southern plains to parts of the northeastern regions.
There may be up to 26 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which would be about 10 degrees above average.
Our long climate outlook indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above average in the eastern United States in the first half of October.
Over 20 Million Watched the Hearing of Brett Kavanaugh
Over 20 million watched Thursday’s gripping testimony from Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who has accused him of sexual assault allegedly taking place in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television stations.
At the same time, the political struggle continued with stations that interrupted the regular programs to tell about Friday’s late development: An agreement drafted by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake, who allowed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation of the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she is 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh in a drunken state was groping her and trying to take her clothes off for a high school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional statement that he is 100 percent sure it didn’t happen.
According to Nielsen, it is likely that 20.4 million saw it on Friday.
The company posted average ratings on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
There were no immediately available viewer numbers from other stations showing it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble measuring how many people watch programs in offices.
To put it in perspective, it’s a viewership equivalent to a game during the NFL playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose opinion-based hosts have strongly backed the appointment of Kavanaugh, was at the top of all stations with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the all-day hearing, Nielsen said.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central character in Friday's drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught opening CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning while protesters shouted at him as he tried to take an elevator to the hearing in the Judiciary Committee.
He stood facing down for several minutes while being scolded, and CNN broadcast live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you," said one woman.
"Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?"
He was told, “You have so much power, and so many women are powerless.”
Flake said that his office had issued a statement, and said before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the committee hearing.
All the television stations covered live a few hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on whether Kavanaugh's nomination should proceed to a full Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only vote for under the conviction that the FBI would investigate the charges against the nominee in the following week, which Democrats, who are in the Senate by-elections, had demanded.
Flake was partly convinced by conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a conversation with Coons and a number of senators afterwards, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s election was influential because it was clear that Republicans would not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the inquiry.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK prime minister accuses critics of ‘doing politics’ with Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the EU to "play politics" with Britain's future and undermine national interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29 September 2018.
In another interview alongside Theresa May on the front page of the paper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson made his attack on her so-called Chequers Brexit plan and said a proposal for Britain and the EU to collect each other's tariffs was "completely ridiculous".
Shooting at Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of being behind LSU player's death
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, has been arrested and jailed on suspicion of negligent manslaughter, Baton Rouge police said.
Officials released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on, CBS subsidiary WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he had confessed to the Wayde shooting.
His bail is set at $350,000, the lawyer reports.
A coroner in East Baton Rouge Parish issued a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was a wound from a gunshot wound that went from head to neck.
The police department says a task force from the Louisiana State Police, the state police laboratory, police from Southern University and citizens in the area have assisted with the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU sports director Joe Alleva thanked the police in the area for their "care and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 198 cm forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "crushed" and "in shock" over Wayde's death.
“It’s the kind of thing you’re always afraid of,” Wade said.
Volcano spewing ash over Mexico City
Ash, which has been spewed from the volcano Popocatepetl, has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico’s capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity occurred in the crater, and 183 gas and ash discharges were recorded within 24 hours.
The center monitored the rumblings and tremors over several rounds.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash on car windows in neighborhoods in Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, located 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clash with Catalan separatists ahead of anniversary of independence vote
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after protesters seeking independence clashed with riot police as thousands took part in rival demonstrations marking the first anniversary of Catalonia’s polarising vote for secession.
A group of masked separatists held off riot police, threw in and powdered paint and created dark dust clouds on streets that would normally be full of tourists.
There were also clashes later in the day when the police used their wands to keep the fighting down.
For several hours, independence groups shouted "Nothing forgotten, nothing forgiven" and were met with unionist protesters shouting "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries that occurred during the protests, the local press reported.
The mood remains high in the independence-minded region a year after the October 1 vote, which was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatist Catalans.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but voter turnout was low, and those opposed to secession largely boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to stop the holding of the vote during violent clashes at polling stations across the region.
Independence groups had camped the night of Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was held, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who participated in the separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer dared to hope that Catalonia could achieve independence.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying for joy at being able to vote, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Although they won a narrow but important victory in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum, and many of their best-known leaders have either themselves moved into exile or are in detention awaiting judgment for their role in holding the vote and the subsequent independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded the protests on his phone in support of police and said the conflict was created by politicians on both sides.
“There’s going to be more and more tension,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been awaiting trial since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament elections next year.
"The nomination as a candidate in the European elections is the best way to distance ourselves from the backlash in democratic values and the subversion we have seen from the Spanish government," he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house hit by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car repeatedly crashed into a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19.30 BST.
Police Inspector Bob Blemmings said damage was done to the gates and the building itself.
There may also have been an armbrush thrown at the car at some point.
Shots from Menga gives Livingston victory in 1-0 over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory
The Livingston upset the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard his second defeat after 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's shot made the difference when Gary Holt's team moved up side by side with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's team has not won out of the league this season and will face the leading team Hearts, which they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, the Rangers will be visited by Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, in turn, expands their undefeated streak to six games, and head coach Holt has still not suffered a defeat since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston misses chances against cash outages
Holt's team should have been ahead long before they scored, and their direct playing style created major problems for the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke through, but delivered across in front of the goal, after which Alan Lithgow inevitably hit outside the goal, after he slipped in to hit Craig Halkett's cross-header in front of the goal.
The home team was happy to let the Rangers play in front of them because they knew they could give the outfield problems in dead-ball situations.
And it was under the circumstances that the important goal came.
The Rangers made a free kick, and Livingston took advantage of an opening. Declan Gallagher and Robinson created the setup together for Menga, who made a touch and scored from the middle of the field.
At the time, the Rangers had dominated possession, but struggled to get through the home team's defenses, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was largely unchallenged.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos intercepted a rescue from Kelly.
Scott Pittman's shot was averted with the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow shot outside the frame during another of Livingston's dead-ball situations.
There were regular deliveries into Livingston’s field, but were averted, and two demands for a penalty kick – after Halkett’s tackle on substitute Glenn Middleton and one by hand on the ball – were rejected.
"Fenomenalt" from Livingston – analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal effort and a strong result for Livingston.
All played fantastic and exceed the expectations of their upward journey.
Their playing style and troupe are largely unchanged since their return to the top league, but much of the credit must go to Holt for the way he has strengthened the team since he stepped in.
There were many heroes.
Captain Halkett was fantastic and led a well-organized defense, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
They have been really good under Gerrard at times, but they played below level.
Their endings lacked sharpness – only once they were stripped of the home team – and that is a sharp awakening for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the scoreboard.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed reception in Cologne
There was a smile and blue sky on Saturday (September 29th), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations with the two NATO members.
Disagreements have arisen in areas such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's approach to the EU.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, large mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turks outside of Turkey.
Police held a crowd of 25,000 from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but plenty of supporters showed up nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan’s opponents – many of them Kurdish – also noted and condemned both Erdogan’s policies and the German government’s decision to accept the country.
The competing protests reflect a controversial guest seen as a hero by some German Turks and mocked as an autocrat by others.
Accident on the road in Deptford: Cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist has died in a collision with a car in London.
The accident happened near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford in the southwestern part of the city around 10.15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and there were rescuers on the spot, but the man died on the spot.
The accident comes a few months after another cyclist died in a collision with a car whose driver fled the scene, on Childers Street, about a mile from Saturday’s accident.
The Metropolitan Police said police officers were working to identify the man and inform his relatives.
Roadblocks have been set up, bus routes have been re-routed, and motorists are encouraged to stay away from the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Officers Injured During Riot
Six prison officers have been injured during a riot in a high-security prison, according to the Prison Office.
Riots broke out in the HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire at around 9.30 a.m. BST on Sunday, and riots are still ongoing.
Specialized "Tornado" officers are brought in to handle the riots, which involve eight inmates and take place in one wing of the prison.
The officers were treated for minor facial injuries on the spot.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison staff are deployed to deal with the ongoing riots at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and are clear that those responsible will be reported to the police and may end up spending longer behind bars.”
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the prison inspector was treated at the hospital after being attacked by an inmate.
And in October last year riot police were called to prison to deal with serious riots in which employees were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with storm surge (dry areas may benefit)
It’s rare for a tropical low to hit Arizona, but it’s most likely early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the desert landscape of the southwestern U.S. and create the risk of a storm surge.
The National Weather Service has already issued storm surge warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona, eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a nonstop route across Phoenix on Tuesday with arrival late Monday with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix pointed out in a tweet that only "ten tropical cyclones had retained tropical storm or low pressure status within 320 km of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 60 miles of the Arizona border.
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center predict 51 to 102 mm of rain with isolated amounts up to 152 mm in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert landscape, including the central Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, are likely to get 25 to 51 mm with the option of 102 mm locally.
For those at risk of storm surge, Rosa’s rain can be a blessing because the region is hit by drought.
Flooding is a very serious matter, but it is likely that some of the rain will benefit because the southwestern United States is currently experiencing drought.<0x3C>/seg>
According to U.S. drought monitoring, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences the least extreme drought, the second-highest category.
First, Hurricane Rosa is expected to hit land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.<0x3C>/seg>
Rosa still has hurricane strength Sunday morning with maximum wind strength of 38 m/s and is located 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and moving north at 19 km/h.
The storm meets cooler waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore falls in strength.
It is therefore expected to hit Mexico with tropical power on Monday afternoon or evening.
The rain over parts of Mexico can become heavy and pose a high risk of flooding.
"There is expected to be a total of 76 to 152 mm of rainfall from Baja California to northwestern Sonora with the possibility of up to 254 mm," weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north across Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical low, which will then move up through Arizona and into southern Utah late Tuesday night.
“The primary expected hazard from Rosa or the remnants of it is very heavy rain in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert region of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center reported.
The rain is expected to create life-threatening storm surges and liquid precipitation in deserts as well as landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4 a.m.
He was taken to the hospital where his condition is reported to be stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, police in Avon and Somerset said.
Officers have urged anyone who may have mobile footage of the events to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh was under the Democratic Party's "evil and anger"
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and monstrous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been exposed to the "evil, anger" of the Democratic Party throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday and strongly and emotionally denied accusations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing of his charges.
The president said Saturday that the "American people saw the skill, quality and courage" of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote on the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote that confirms one of the most talented legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an amazing past in public service,” he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republicans meeting at polling stations in the midterm elections.
“In five weeks, one of the most important choices is in our lifetime.
“You can’t vote for me, but you’re actually voting for me,” he said.
"That's why I'm traveling around and fighting for amazing candidates."
Trump argued that Democrats are on a mission to “fight and block.”
The first important procedural vote in the Senate on the nomination of Kavanaugh is expected to take place no later than Friday, a person high in the Republican party has told CNN.
Hundreds killed by Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll rising
At least 384 were killed, many of them washed away by huge waves hitting the beach when a major earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Several hundred people were gathered for a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday, when up to six meters high waves hit the coast at dusk, sucking many to death and destroying everything on their way.
The tsunami was caused by an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the tsunami occurred yesterday, people were still doing activities on the beach. They didn't run right away and became victims," Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster preparedness BNPB, said during a briefing in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, the towed cars, wooden trunks, houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had moved through the open sea at 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
More people managed to survive by climbing trees to escape the tsunami, he said.
About 16,700 were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
The disaster preparedness team has published aerial photographs showing many destroyed buildings and shops, distorted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
Submarines continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes could be felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia’s Board of Assessment and Use of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released during Friday’s major earthquake was about 200 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The city is geographically located at the end of a long, narrow bay, and it may have made the tsunami bigger, the board said.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and said thousands of houses, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of a number of victims were found stuck under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 had been injured and that 29 were reported missing.
Nugroho said the death toll and damage could be greater along the 300-km-long coastline north of Palu, the Donggala area, which is closer to the earthquake's epicenter.
The communication "was completely paralyzed without information" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"There are over 300,000 living here," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy, but it could get much worse," they said.
The board was criticized on Saturday from many fronts for not disclosing that a tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves had come within the time of the warning.
In amateur footage shared on social media, you can hear a man on the top floor of a building desperately shouting warnings of the approaching tsunami to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water hits the coast and carries buildings and cars away.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a major power outage that cut off communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes with emergency aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities say, but there is still a severe need for food and basic necessities among the evacuees.
The city's airport has been reopened, but only for relief work, and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami is over 800.
It's really bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have safely arrived in Palu city, where employees seek shelter under tarpaulins set up in the courtyard of their account. They came by areas with extensive destruction on the way, Doseba said.
“They told me that they had destroyed so many houses,” he said.
It's really bad.
Even when aid organizations began the hard work of putting the aid work back on track, complaints came about the fact that foreign aid workers with extensive expertise were prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial support, supplies and staff from abroad can only come in if the area where the accident occurred is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
“It’s still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for Indonesia’s Red Cross.
“When the government says ‘OK, it’s a national disaster,’ we can open up for international assistance, but there’s no status yet.”
On the second night in Palu after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami, friends and family of the missing people held on to the hope that their loved ones would be the miracles that illuminate the gloomy tales of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled up by a sewer.
On Saturday, rescue workers freed a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother’s body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, had trained two of the missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who were caught at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were among his students.
“As a veteran of paragliding, I have my own emotional burden,” he said.
Mr. Gendon told how in the hours following the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel circulated in paragliding circles, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the participants in Palu, who were attending the festival on the beach.
His messages, however, resulted in only one gray fly leg instead of two blue ones.
“I think that means that the messages were not delivered,” he says.
Twenty takes $26,750 while filling the ATM in Newport on the Levee
Tyve stole $26,750 from a Brink's employee who was filling a cash machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a press release from Newport police.
The driver of the car had emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to deliver more money, Detective Assistant Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, another man ran "up behind the Brink's employee" and stole a purse that should have been delivered.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police did not specify how many were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information about the identity of the thieves should contact the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change Saturday on Twitter, writing, "The creature previously known as Kanye West."
West, 41, has had the nickname Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show, who canceled for "emotional reasons," the show's creator said.
The name is an abbreviation of his current artist name, but West has previously said that the name has religious significance for him.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you’,” West said earlier in the year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
"So I'm you, I'm us, it's us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye – which is a reflection of our good, bad and confused sides, everything.
The album is more of a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of a number of famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has switched between Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
One of West’s former collaborators, JAY-Z, has also switched between lowercase and uppercase letters and changed whether the hyphen is included.
Mexico’s AMLO pledges not to use military force against civilians
Mexico’s newly elected president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches its 50th anniversary of a bloody retaliatory action against students.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "never use the military to oppress the Mexican people."
Troops fired at a peaceful demonstration on the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 at a time when leftist student movements took root in many places in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by providing monthly state grants to students and opening several free, open universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities draw young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount it spends on research in the field, says investor and AI user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after various parts of the US government have issued statements about artificial intelligence, but the US still lacks a formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
However, China introduced their plan last year and aims to take the first place in innovation in artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good idea to double the research budget for artificial intelligence, as all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next big breakthrough in AI,” Lee said.
Doubling the budget could double the chances of the next major performance in artificial intelligence being achieved in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee published the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" this month at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest-ranking American Othello player, and later became head of Microsoft Research and director of Google’s China division.
Lee acknowledged past technology competitions supported by the U.S. government, such as the Robotics Challenge, held by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when a new competition will be held so that the next visionaries can be identified.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to obtain government grants, Lee says.
“It’s not China that is grabbing the academic leaders, it’s the big companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired star students from universities to work with artificial intelligence.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its efforts in the field of artificial intelligence.
“I think that PhDs in artificial intelligence should have automatically offered work permits.
In July 2017, China’s Minister of State issued its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
China’s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people at academic institutions in a way similar to the National Science Foundation and other state organizations’ distribution of money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center to involve partners from industry and research, and the White House announced the founding of the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
NSF is currently investing over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
However, U.S. legislation attempting to create a national security commission for artificial intelligence has been silent for months.
Macedonians hold vote to change country's name
The Macedonian people voted on Sunday on whether to change their country’s name to the “Republic of North Macedonia,” a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that has blocked Macedonia’s attempts to gain membership of the EU and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of its neighbouring country to the north constitutes a requirement on Greek territory, and has therefore used their veto when Macedonia has sought membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s primarily Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not take part in the vote, and a boycott campaign has cast doubt on whether the voter turnout will be the 50% required for the vote to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, believe that it is a price worth paying to create access to associations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because it means safer lives for all of us," said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
The vote is not legally binding, but enough Members of Parliament have said that they will comply with the result of the vote and make it valid.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The state election commission said no irregularities had been reported at 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, where 66 percent of registered voters voted.
"I voted today because of my children. We belong in Europe," said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko took part in the vote in Macedonia on a change of name that would open the door to NATO and EU membership in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small scene and pulled up chairs in front of tents set up by those who want to boycott the vote.
"We are for NATO and the European Union, but we will achieve membership with raised forehead, not at the back door," Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn against others like China and Russia and become part of the European-Asian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership would provide a much-needed investment in Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I think a large majority will vote in favour because over 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said a “yes” result would be a “safety of our future.”
A poll released last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research indicated that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the vote – fewer than the required voter turnout.
Another poll conducted by Macedonian TV channel Telma TV indicated that 57 percent of those polled planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
In order for the vote to be valid, the turnout must be at least 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote fails, it will be the first major political loss for the pro-life government since it took office in May last year.
See: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero fights his way through Brighton defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling fought the Brighton defence in Manchester City's 2-0 win at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy with his scoring coming after 65 minutes.
The Argentine attacker received a midfield pass at the beginning of the sequence.
He quickly ran past three Brighton defenders before swooping out onto the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He fought his way past one defender, and then ran from several on the edge of Brighton's field.
He then made a pass to the left and found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the field to give the ball back to Aguero, who used his right boot to overtake Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot on the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with some problems with his feet,” City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were talking about him playing around 55 or 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal in that moment.”
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the immediate lead in the Premier League game.
The goal came after 29 minutes.
Aguero received the ball in the sequence deep inside Brighton's territory.
He sent a nice delivery along the left flank to Leroy Sane.
Sane took a few touches before leading Sterling to the farthest post.
The Sky Blues forward spotted the ball in the net just before it slipped past the goal.
City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the Champions League at 12.55 pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to drill rockies
The Nationals are eliminated from playoff participation, so they didn’t have much to fight for.
But the always competitive Scherzer hopes to take the toss Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if there is still the possibility of participating in the playoffs for the Rockies, who have played one game more than the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies held at least one wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but still hold their first division title for good.
“Even if we don’t have anything to play for, we can go to the game knowing that the atmosphere would be at its highest among the audience here in Denver and that the opponents would play at the enough highest level I’m going to face this year.
Why shouldn’t I be excited about playing in those conditions?”
The Nationals have not yet announced the starting lineup for Sunday, but will likely put Scherzer in as a pitcher in such a situation.
Scherzer, who would be the first man on the spot for the 34th time, trained his throws on Tuesday and would pitch on Sunday, which is normally his day of rest.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump holds voter rally in West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation surrounding his election to the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while speaking about the importance of Republicans meeting at polling stations in midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks from one of the most important choices in our lifetime.
It’s one of the big, big ones – you can’t vote for me, but you’re actually voting for me. That’s why I’m traveling around and fighting for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You can see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you can see it’s happening right now.
And they are determined to get power back by all available means. You can see how vicious, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they're going to run against to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, but we're not going to give it to them."
The Democrats, he said, have as a mission "fight and block".
“And you’ve seen it over the last four days,” he said, calling the Democrats “angry and vicious and disgusting and lying.”
He referred to the top Democratic senator in the Senate Judiciary Committee Dianne Feinstein by name, which loudly triggered the booze from the audience.
"Do you remember her answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
No, uh, no, wait -- it was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen."
Labour is no longer a political party.
They are intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momentum’s activists in my local party voted to censor me, it wasn’t really a surprise.
I am just the latest in a long line of Labour MPs who have been told that we are not welcome – just because we have made our opinion known.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, received a similar treatment because she strongly distanced herself from anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship measure was to criticize me because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
In relation to the importance of a responsible economic policy, in relation to national security, in Europe, ironically similar problems, in which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
At the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday, it was said that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Member of Parliament, Friday night's meetings have been just that.
Today, unfortunately, the tone in many meetings is not so, and the promise of “friendly, gentler” politics is far back in the past if it ever got going.
It has become more and more clear that dissenting views are not tolerated in Labour and that all opinions are weighed according to whether the party leadership can accept them.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when colleagues, with whom I previously thought I shared a political position, began to expect me to make a U-turn and take positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with – whether it was national security or the EU’s internal market.
When I say my opinion in public – and it doesn’t really matter what I say – a long line of rude messages on social media follows, calling for abstinence and opposition to middle-class politics and telling me that I shouldn’t be a member of Labour.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I am more successful than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have deep respect for the professionalism and fighting will of those colleagues who are daily overwhelmed by sexism or racism, but still continue to fight.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is how normal abuse has become.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should create a tolerant culture.
But in reality, it is no longer a spacious organization and with every vote of no confidence or change in the rules of selection, the party becomes narrower.
I’ve been getting a lot of advice over the last two years that if I put a lid on myself and I’m not so loud, then I’ll have to “make it up”.
But that’s not why I went into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago, when I went to school, I was provoked by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which had left our classroom in a state of decay, and I set out to create better public services for those who need it most – whether as a city councillor or as a minister in the government.
I have never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could in any way have been confused about my political positions and disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who tabled the resolution on Friday, I want to say that when the country turns to Brexit, which will harm households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to Labour’s leader.
But the one message I have is not for Nottingham Momentum, but for the local voters, whether they are members of Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no form of threat of abstention or political fitness will deter me from acting on what I believe is your interest.
Chris Leslie is Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr becomes top team
Two late scores may have given the final result to draw a not quite truthful picture, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the victory in this fantastically entertaining match of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now at the top of the points table and are the only undefeated team out of ten.
In the end, it was just as much their superior defense as their better use of chance that carried the home team home, and coach Peter Murchie had an absolute right to be satisfied.
“Our fights have been demanding so far and we are still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Respect for Ayr, they took their chances better than us.”
Grant Anderson's score after 14 minutes was followed by a successful kick from Frazier Climo and brought Ayr in front, but a yellow card to Scottish national team player Rory Hughes, who was awarded to the match by the Warriors, gave Melrose an advantage, and Jason Baggot made a score that was not followed up by an s.
Climo expanded Ayr's lead with a penalty kick just before the semi-final, scoring and then getting a solo score, so that Ayr was 17-5 at the break.
But Melrose started well in the second half, and Patrick Anderson's scoring, followed by a kick from Baggot, reduced the point difference to five.
There was then a long break because Ruaridh Knott had suffered a serious injury. He was carried out of the field on stretchers. When the game was resumed, Ayr expanded the lead with a score from Stafford McDowall and a follow-up kick from Climo.
Acting Ayr manager Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card, and again Melrose took advantage of their extra man with a score from Bruce Colvine without a follow-up kick after a period of intense pressure.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball, MacPherson could after a line-out score behind the forward Ayr cluster.
Climo followed up with a kick inside the posts and followed up with a more almost immediately after the game was resumed, after Kyle Rowe intercepted David Armstrong's box kick and sent winger Gregor Henry off to the home field's fifth score.
Still Game star looking for a new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran seems to be taking the step of the restaurant industry after it emerged that he has taken the position of CEO of an authorized restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he writes and is the main character together with his collaborator Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the final season of the series, and it seems that Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a source suggested to Scottish Sun that Kiernan would be part of Glasgow's "growing market for restaurants".
"The sea is ours": the state of Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the route to the Pacific
Sailors patrol around the fleet headquarters, which is shrouded in rain, in La Paz.
In public buildings, there is a blue flag.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are overpainted with the motto: “The sea is ours, it’s a right.
It’s a duty to take it back.”
Throughout the inland state of Bolivia, the memory of a stretch of coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 19th century is still strong, and so is the longing to sail the Pacific again.
The hopes may be at their highest for decades, while Bolivia awaits a judgment from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of voting.
“Bolivia has momentum, a sense of community and clarity, and of course awaits with a positive outlook on the outcome,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the decision of the International Court of Justice on big screens throughout the country and hope that the court in The Hague will give Bolivia the assurance that Chile, after decades of discussions, is obliged to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereignty over an area with access to the sea.
Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, facing a controversial election campaign next year, also has much at stake in Monday’s sentencing.
“We are close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised last August.
But analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will take Bolivia’s side – and that there would be no major changes if it did.
The UN Assembly, which has its seat in the Netherlands, does not have the power to take over Chilean territory and has stipulated that it cannot determine the outcome of possible discussions.
The International Court of Justice ruling just six months after the final arguments were heard indicates that the case was “not complicated,” said Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And instead of advancing Bolivia’s cause, the past four years may have set back.
“The case of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian leadership,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’ warlike rhetoric has done away with the remaining Chilean benevolence, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the discussions, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision-making was abnormally fast.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "an extraordinary opportunity to open a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end an era of 139 years of disagreements and gain benefits for both parties," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents, used the maritime problem as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up the right of access to the Pacific,” he added.
"The renunciation is an opportunity to see that we have overcome the past."
North Korea says there will be no nuclear disarmament unless it can rely on the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm their nuclear weapons if they can’t first trust Washington.
Ri spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to abide by promises made during a summit in Singapore between rival leaders.
His comments came after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be facing a restart of stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after a meeting in Singapore with North Korea’s Kim Jong Un.
Ri says it is a “dream of wishful thinking” that continued sanctions and U.S. opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War will ever bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is reticent about the declaration as long as Pyongyang has not first taken significant steps towards disarmament.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump will have one more summit.
But there is widespread scepticism about whether Pyongyang is serious about abolishing an arsenal that the country most likely sees as the only thing that can guarantee their security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month in preparation for a new summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris reveal the latest collections with large headwear, which you will soon be able to buy in local stores
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or block the sun completely, you will find the answer here.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne lifted the veil on the catwalk for a collection of remarkable headwear in extra large size as part of their SS19 collection. The collection impressed at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats have dominated Instagram this summer, and the two designers have sent their eye-catching creations down the catwalk.
The most impressive work from Valentino was a lavish one with a distantly wide shadow that covered the models’ heads.
There were also other extra-large accessories, including watermelons with jewels and even a pineapple – but they’re not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had stitched lips that resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One creation looked like a diving thing with a snorkel and a mask, and others looked like a melted waffle ice cream.
And if you continue the big fashion statements, you’re in luck.
Style scouts predict that the huge hats could come to stores near you.
The giant hats arrive in the heels of "La Bomba", the straw hat with a 60-centimeter-wide shadow that is seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult brand behind the highly impractical hate that was spread across social media has sent a new big creation down the catwalk – a straw beach bag that’s almost as big as the model displaying it.
The orange bast bag with bast fringes and a white leather handle was the most eye-catching in Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
The famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in regular stores next summer. The designer has had such a huge influence that it becomes hard to ignore the demand for accessories in huge size."
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools have many great academic achievements behind them, and it remains in 2018 with yet another series of outstanding exam results, which are further enhanced by individual and collective success in sports, art, music and other efforts in the local environment.
With up to 30,000 students around Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
The independent schools try to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen career and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector that can compile and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we find that modern languages remain a popular topic in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, he hits that head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it hits the heart.”
It’s an important reminder that we can’t just stick to English when we want to build relationships and trust among people from other countries.
We can look at the latest exam results this year, that languages are highest in the statistics with the most passed exams in the independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who studied foreign languages received the high grade A.
The data collected by SCIS' 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students received grade A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who studied German, 69 percent of those who studied French, and 63 percent of those who studied Spanish also received an A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now perceived as subject choice at the same level as STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in independent schools’ pensa and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that, among the reasons employers could not fill vacancies, 17% had to do with language skills shortages.
Therefore, language skills are becoming more and more important in preparing young people for their future careers.
More job opportunities will require language skills in the future, and these skills are essential in a globalised world.
Whatever career the young people choose, if they have learned another language, they have a great advantage in the future with a lifelong skill like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from other countries automatically gives a multilingual person a head start for competitors.
According to a YouGov poll of over 4,000 respondents in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French is the only language spoken by a multi-digit percentage, 15 percent.
Therefore, it is important to invest in language teaching for those who are children today.
Speaking multiple languages, especially languages from developing countries, gives children a better chance of finding meaningful work.
In Scotland, there is a difference between schools and the languages in which they are taught.
A number of schools focus on the more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are expected to be most important to the UK when looking forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child is interested in, there will always be a variety of languages to choose from at independent schools with teachers who are specialists in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and gives them the skills required to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that languages continue to be really important for the country's future in a global business environment, and this must be reflected in the training programmes.
Modern languages should really be considered "international communication skills".
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, this diversity and this award to Scotland’s youth.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the President of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron makes his Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opening game before the start of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than 1 and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is unlikely to play the entire game.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans in relation to the Lakers' scheduled six games before the start of the season.
“Where I am in my career, I don’t have to fight before the start of the season to get ready,” he said.
Trump's voter rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a streak of voter rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s Trump’s first of five planned voter meetings next week, including meetings in Trump-friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
While the vote to confirm Trump’s appointed judge to the vacant seat at the Supreme Court is on hold, Trump is trying to build support for the upcoming midterm elections because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress when the votes are cast in November.
When is Trump’s election rally in West Virginia tonight, and how do you see it online?
Trump’s election rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is held at midnight (Danish time) on the night between Saturday, November 29 and Sunday, November 30, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s election rally in West Virginia online via livestream on YouTube.
Trump will most likely talk about this week's hearings on Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for the Supreme Court. The hearings were tense due to accusations of sexually abusive behavior, and the expected Senate vote on confirmation has been put on hold for a week while the FBI investigates the charges.
But the primary goal of this streak of voter meetings is to create momentum for those Republicans facing a difficult election in November.
People from President Trump’s campaign team said the five voter meetings next week are aimed at “creating energy among volunteers and supporting when Republicans try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives,” according to Reuters.
“Control of Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible now that we enter the busy campaign period,” a Trump campaign spokesman, who would not be cited by name, told Reuters.
Tonight's voter meeting will be held at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and is expected to attract Trump supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by the media from Pittsburgh," according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won by over 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia’s Republican Senate candidate, Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president needs to step up to give him a boost in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown fighting spirit and is trying to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles
After three one-sided innings, Saturday’s four-man duels were perhaps what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging momentum pendulum is a thoroughly invented sports concept, but a concept that players believe in – not least in competitions like this one.
Where would you say there is momentum?
“They led by six points, and now it’s four, so we probably see that a bit as momentum,” Spieth said.
Europe, of course, has the advantage: they are 4 points ahead and there are 12 more points to play for.
However, as Spieth says, Americans feel that they have little wind in the sails, and there are plenty of encouraging things to focus on, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and both can boast three points out of four possible.
Spieth has been sharp from tee to green and sets a good example for his teammates.
The high cheers became louder as the round continued, and Spieth hit an important put, which ensured victory in duel four, although he and Thomas had been two strokes behind after two duels.
His put, which secured them the fight at hole 15, was met with a similar scream – the kind of scream that shows he doesn’t think the U.S. team is out of the competition yet.
“You just have to find the inner strength out there and focus on your own fight,” Spieth said.
That’s all the players have left now.
18 holes where you can make a difference.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, arguably the biggest story of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's strange but sympathetic couple have scored four points in four matches, and appear to be flawless.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't get a bogey Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided bogeys Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes Friday morning.
The series and the way the energy seems to flow on both to and from the wild audience, shows that it is they who will be hardest to beat Sunday. And it would undoubtedly be very popular if a potential European victory is pinned down by Fleetwood or Molinari when the sun sets over Le Golf National.
All in sync on each hole.
However, it is too early to talk about a European victory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial against Sergio Garcia, the morning of the four-man duels, when he formed a pair with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two double bogeys on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swedish into a hole they were never close to getting out of.
On Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The games with four balls and two teams of two players are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between the couples, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way the strategy can change quickly.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has created a significant lead before the last day, but the four-man duels have also shown that Team USA has the fighting spirit that some, especially in the United States, have doubted.
Europe leads 10-6 ahead of last day in Ryder Cup
Europe has a big advantage before the last day at the Ryder Cup, after they came out of Saturday's fourballs and foursomes with a lead over the US of 10-6.
Well-playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins over a troubled Tiger Woods and have so far scored four points at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn’s European team, trying to win the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, dominated an inaccurate American team in the morning fourballs and won the series 3-1.
The U.S. faced more opposition in the foursomes, winning four games but still lagging behind.
Jim Furyk’s team will need eight points in Sunday’s 12 singles matches if they are to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European debutant to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, who together have been nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are just the second pair in Ryder Cup history to have won four points in their first four games.
They smashed Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs and then elegantly defeated a brash Woods and American debutant Bryson Dechambeau with an even more impressive 5&4.
Woods, who fought his way through the first two games on Saturday, had small brilliant glimpses, but now he has lost 19 out of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose was well rested for the morning fourballs and returned to partner Henrik Stenson in the foursomes and won a 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – number three in the world.
Europe, however, has it exactly as they want it, on a slightly windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas showed the way for the Americans by two points on Saturday.
They won a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and later returned and defeated Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the Ryder Cup history that a team has fought back after being behind by four points before the singles matches. Since Furyks currently has the trophy, however, they only need to reach a tie to keep it.
After being second best for two days, however, it seems that they cannot master a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm if there is no trust
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions are reinforcing their mistrust of the United States and that the country will not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization General Assembly that North Korea had shown "significant goodwill" within the past year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling an area for nuclear tests, and promising not to further develop nuclear weapons and technology.
“We have not seen a similar reaction from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under such conditions, there is no chance that we ourselves will take the first step and unilaterally disarm.”
While Ri reiterated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington's opposition to a "phased" approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded if they took gradual steps. But his speech seemed important, as it did not unequivocally reject unilateral disarmament, as had been the case previously from Pyongyang.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, where Kim promised to work “nuclear disarmament on the Korean peninsula,” while Trump promised to guarantee North Korea’s security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also shown resistance to softening harsh international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States insists on 'nuclear disarmament first' and expands the pressure with sanctions to achieve their purpose by coercion and even opposes 'the declaration of the end of the war'," Ri said.
“The notion that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream come true among people who don’t know who we are.
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are reinforcing our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for a summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader highlighted at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in within the past five months, adding: “If nuclear disarmament were to be negotiated with South Korea and not the United States, the negotiations would not be so stalled.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that firing North Korea’s missiles at the US mainland was inevitable, after “Mr Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
Last year, Trump at the UN threatened “total destruction” of North Korea, but this year he praised Kim for showing courage in terms of disarmament, but said there is still much to be done and that sanctions must remain until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have a schedule for these measures, but said "it doesn't matter whether it takes two years, three years or five months."
China and Russia believe that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council must maintain sanctions with conviction and without error until we achieve total, final, confirmed nuclear disarmament."
Since 2006, the Security Council has unanimously increased economic sanctions against North Korea in an attempt to stop Pyongyang’s missile and nuclear weapons program.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and subsequently said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times during the year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made, while North Korea accused him just hours later of making “gangster demands.”
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea vowed to shut down a missile plant as well as a nuclear complex if the United States took “similar steps.”
He said Kim had told him that the “similar steps” he demanded were the security promises Trump made in Singapore, as well as moves toward a normalization of relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course on getting enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University has given all undergraduate students more sleep. The purpose of the course is to counteract the growing macho culture where studying all night long kept up with large amounts of caffeine.
One researcher has shown that students at the world’s best university often don’t know the first thing about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, has made the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea for the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
"When the essay was finished, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why do I get to know this now when I'm on the candidate?'
“She said no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,” he told The Telegraph.
The course, which is offered for the first time this year, explains to students how good sleeping habits can improve one’s academic and sporting performance as well as one’s overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health field, says the university has decided to offer the course after finding out that the students were in severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course consists of various interactive exercises.
In one of the exercises, there is a picture of a college room where students have to click on coffee cups, curtains, running shoes and books to gain knowledge about the effects of caffeine and light, and how one’s athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and how important good sleep habits are.
In another part of the course, participants hear about how sleep deprivation over a long period of time increases the risk of heart attacks, blood clots, depression and cancer.
Participants are encouraged to think about their daily habits by clicking on different icons on an interactive map of campus.
"We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we think they have a right to know – just like you have a right to know how cigarettes affect health,” adds Professor Czeisler.
The pride in taking an "allnighter" still exists, he says, adding that modern technology and increased pressure on the students has led to sleep deprivation being a growing problem.
The “secret weapon” against stress, exhaustion and anxiety is good and adequate sleep, he said – it even counteracts weight gain because lack of sleep makes the brain think you’re hungry, why they’re constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler organize the course last year when he took one of his courses on his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and made him work on making it a public course throughout the university.
He hopes that the next step will be for all graduates to be offered a similar course before continuing their education.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set an alarm so that they know when to go to bed and when to get up. This can create awareness of the harmful effects of light from electronic screens, which can shift at the circadian rhythm and make it more difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goals from Menga lowers Gerrard and co.
The Rangers suffered another defeat on the field when Dolly Menga's goal meant Steven Gerrard's inconsistent team had to take thanks with a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team was out for their first away win since the 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team only gave Gerrard his second defeat in 18 games as a coach, giving Hearts eight points up to first place in Ladbrokes Premiership.
Menga hit seven minutes before the break, which an uninspired Rangers team could not respond to.
The Rangers are now down to sixth place, while Livingston climbs up to third place after Hibernian with only the goal score difference.
And there could be more bad news on the way to the Rangers, as line judge Calum Spence had to be treated after being hit in the head by a thrown object that appeared to come from the off-road section.
Gerrard made eight changes to the lineup that reached the Betfed Cup semi-finals by toning past Ayr.
Holt, on the other hand, put in the same 11 that shaved a point off Hearts' lead last week, and he would have been delighted to see his sharp team exhausting opponents across the field.
The Rangers had the ball the most, but Livingston was more effective.
They should have scored two minutes into the game when Menga's first-ever pass sent Scott Pittman against Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder's attempt failed.
A free kick in the depth from Keaghan Jacobs found its way to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive player Alan Lithgow kicked past the rear post.
However, the Rangers took control, but played more on hope than ability in the attacking game.
At least Alfredo Morales was not satisfied when Judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian’s appeals for a penalty kick when he and Steven Lawless brought together after a 15-minute game.
The Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Rangers goalkeeper Liam Kelly had no problems with Lassana Coulibaly's head shot and Ovie Ejaria's tame shot.
Although Livi’s opening in the 34th minute was somewhat random, it must be said to be deserving of their efforts alone.
Again, the Rangers could not handle a deadbolt situation in depth from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who took the time to find Menga who could easily kick it into goal.
In the break, Gerrard replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, which almost immediately gave paw when the winger sent the ball in to Morelos, but the well-playing Kelly ran from his position to block.
But Livingston forced the team to play on their premises with many long balls up the court from Lithgow and Halkett.
Holt's team could have extended the lead in the final part of the game, but McGregor rejected Jacobs with a safe hand before Lithgow headed alongside goal.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton again appealed for a late penalty kick after being wiped out along with Jacobs, but Judge Thomson also looked here the other way.
Yearbook: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page from the yearbook "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today – if we count... – was the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that would eventually lead to the apparatus known as the geiger counter.
The Geiger counter has become a staple of both science and popular culture, as seen in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans starred as fellow scientists:
Man: "What in the world is that?"
Rogers: "It's a geiger counter that's used to find radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atoms that the radioactivity in the minerals makes.”
Evans: "Stop it, it's on!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before he would have turned 63.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine could teach immune system to ‘see’ cancer cells
New cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to “see” cancer cells and kill them
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells as part of treatment
The method consists in extracting immune cells from a patient and changing them in the laboratory.
They can then “see” the protein that is common to many cancers and where they are injected again.
A test vaccine is promising in patients with a variety of cancers.
When a woman with ovarian cancer was treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize cancer cells, the cancer disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method consists of extracting immune cells from patients and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can "see" the protein called HER2, which many cancers have, and then injecting the cells again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “causes several cancers to develop,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and bowel cancers, explains Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach, by taking immune cells out of patients and "teaching" them to attack cancer cells, has worked in the treatment of a particular type of leukemia.
Kanye West gave a Trump-friendly speech wearing a MAGA hat after his SNL performance.
It didn't go well.
After an inconsistent performance in the Saturday Night Live studio, Kanye West was booed when he paid tribute to U.S. President Donald Trump and said he himself would run for president in 2020.
After playing the third song of the evening Ghost Town wearing a Make America Great Again casket, he began a thunderous speech against the Democrats and maintained his support for Trump.
“I talk so often to white people who say, ‘Why do you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
But if I worried about racism, I would have long ago moved out of the United States,” he said.
SNL kicked off tonight's show with a sketch with Matt Damon, where the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding Christine Blasey Ford's abuse charges.
Although the footage was not shown, comedian Chris Rock West uploaded the tirade on social media.
It's unclear if Rock tried to expose West by uploading the footage.
West also complained to the public about poor backstage treatment due to his headgear.
"They bullied me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out there with that hat on.'
They bullied me!
And they said I was sunk deep," he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued, "Do you want to see how deep I've sunk?" and said that he would put on his Superman cap because it means that "You can't decide what to do. Do you want progress in the world?
Try it with love.”
The audience booed at least twice of his comments, and the SNL staff seemed to be embarrassedly touched, Variety informs with a comment from a person present: "There was silence in the studio."
West had been booked as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose then-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing the song I Love It while he was dressed up as a Perrier bottle.
West received support from the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: THANK YOU FOR NOT LETTING YOU CHOOSE THE MOMENT."
Talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "who he is, and that's just fine."
“But I do NOT choose to reward a person (by buying his music, his clothes, or supporting his ‘art’) who embraces and pours out an ideology that is harmful to society.
He's allowed.
And so do we," she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced that he had taken the name change to "the entity officially known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and thus follows Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Snoop Dogg is known as Snoop Lion, and the recently deceased music legend Prince changed his name to a symbol and then to The Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Man charged with attempted murder after knife-wielding in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed with a knife in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police say.
The defendants are expected to appear before the Belfast Court of Appeal on Monday.
The allegations are being investigated by the Public Prosecutor’s Office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington longs for toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for swinging swords in the role of Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor longs for the stereotypical macho hero and says that such TV characters mean that young men often feel they have to be tough to be respected.
Kit told the Sunday Times Culture that he believes “something has gone wrong” and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at 31, admitted that the problem lies with him "very much on mind".
“At the moment, I have a lot on my mind – where have we gone wrong in the city with masculinity?” he said.
"If we look at the current problems, then what have we learned young men in their upbringing?"
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity due to the very masculine characters.
He continued, "What is innate, and what is intended?
What is it that young men learn from television and on the street that makes them feel that they should be men in this way?
I think that’s one of the big questions of our time – how do we change it?
It’s obvious that something has gone wrong for the young men.”
During the interview, he also admitted that he will not be making sequels to Game of Thrones when the series ends next summer, saying that he is "finished with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit is in a remake of Sam Shepard’s True West, the story of a film director and his brother who is a thief.
The actor recently revealed that he considers it to have met his wife Rose as the best of the entire Game of Thrones experience.
“I met my wife because of this series, so it has given me my future family and shaped my life forever,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, in which Kit's character, Jon Snow, falls in love with, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people in the country have been affected, according to health authorities.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, 40,000 new cases were recorded.
The vast majority of new cases were sexually transmitted, which is a new trend.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people getting HIV in this way has been reduced to near zero, Chinese health authorities say at a conference in Yunnan province.
In one year, however, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
Sexually transmitted HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT environment.
Homosexuality was legalized in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is said to be a widespread phenomenon.
Studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men marry women sooner or later because of the country’s conservative values.
Many cases of infection are due to the lack of use of contraception in these conditions.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised free and equal access to HIV medicine as an attempt to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staff leaked data on Republican senators and thunders against “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that a member of her staff shared personal information about three Republican senators on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the allegations stemmed from websites and support from “the far right.”
“Lies, lies and more terrible lies,” Waters wrote on Twitter.
The published information allegedly contained home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina as well as Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of whom are from Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, during a Senate hearing on allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative support sites such as Gateway Pundit of RedState announced that the IP addresses indicated that the information had been posted by Waters' people, after which they published information about a member of Waters' staff.
“This unsubstantiated allegation is completely untrue and a direct lie,” Waters continued.
"The member of my staff whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false accusations is in no way responsible for this leak of information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and a direct lie.”
Waters' statement quickly received criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"It's an angry denial," Fleischer wrote.
“That suggests she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a congressman.
If you are accused of something you haven’t done, don’t get angry.
You must not be defiant.
You can't question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to keep your sanity.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Kavanaugh, who was criticized for being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate aiming to take Waters' place in the midterm elections, also made his opinion known on Twitter.
“Great, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
In Waters' official statement, she says her staff have contacted "the relevant authorities and law enforcement regarding these fraudulent allegations."
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are found," she continued. "And that they will be held legally responsible for their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to everyone and anyone in my staff."
Johnny English Review Strikes Again – Underwhelming Spy Comedy with Rowan Atkinson
It has become the norm to look for a Brexit angle in all recent films with a British flair, and it also seems relevant to the latest action comedy in the Johnny English series, which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and appeared again in 2011 with Johnny English - born again.
Will the bold, sarcastic self-satisfaction about how glaringly we are, become the country’s new export opportunity?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his rubbery face and big eyes, has been allowed to make roarers again. His name signals more than anything else that he is a comic invention aimed at places where cinemagoers do not speak English.
He is, of course, the sloppy secret agent who, despite his desire to be a smooth gentleman, has a bit of Clouseau, a knife-edged Mr. Bean and a proper pat on the back of him who performed a single tone to the Chariots of Fire song at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the worldwide and international panties that left chaos in his wake, after Atkinson portrayed him in Barclaycard's television commercials.
There are some good moments in this latest shot at the tribe from JE.
I loved it when Johnny English approached a helicopter wearing a medieval armor, and the propellers sounded against his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy can be seen, but the humor feels rather underwhelming and strangely redundant, especially now that more "serious" film series like 007 and Mission Impossible also feature compelling comedy as an ingredient.
The humor seems to be directed at children rather than adults, and for me Johnny English’s crazy adventures aren’t as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent-film nonsense in the role of Mr. Bean.
The film’s never-ending starting point is that the UK is in serious trouble.
An internet hacker has infiltrated England’s top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all the English agents in the field to the dismay of the responsible agent – a unfortunately very small role for Kevin Eldon.
It is the last chance for a pompous and combative Prime Minister who is already suffering a complete meltdown in political popularity: Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Teresa May-like character, but there is not much to work with in the script.
When her security advisers inform her that every active spy has been exposed, she is forced to cancel someone’s pension.
And of course it’s the clumsy Johnny English, who is now a school inspector at a top-class school, but who secretly teaches how to become a secret agent. There are some funny sequences here when English stands for some kind of School of Rock training in espionage.
English is rushed back to an emergency meeting at Whitehall and reunites with his tried-and-true former right-hand Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough has now been married to an over-enthusiastic but well-meaning submarine captain – a role played by Vicki Pepperdine.
Thus, the royal intelligence agency's all-rounder Batman and Robin are back when they meet Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophilia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is slumping close to being let down by the charismatic and creepy tech billionaire Jason Volta – played by Jake Lacy – who claims to be able to solve England’s computer problems.
English and Bough start their furiously risky escapades: disguised as servants, they set fire to a fine French restaurant; they create chaos as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta’s luxury yacht; and English creates pure ragnarok as he tries to use virtual reality glasses to get to know Volta’s house.
All the guns are fired in the ending sequence of the film, but no matter how well-meaning and energetic it is, there is a sense of children's television over it.
Fairly mediocre.
And as I couldn’t help but think with the other Johnny English films: Can’t the English film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that does his talent justice?
Labour refuses to fight with plan for four-day working week with unchanged salary for the British
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour is said to be considering a radical plan so that the English can settle for a four-day workweek but get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants business leaders to use their savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to give employees an extra day off.
This would mean that the employees would have a three-day weekend without going down in wages.
Sources say the idea would align with the party’s economic goals of pulling the country in a more favourable direction for the workers.
Trades Union Congress supports the idea of a four-day workweek as a way for workers to benefit from a changing economy.
An experienced member of the Larbour party told The Sunday Times: “A political proposal is expected to be published by the end of the year.”
“It’s not going to happen in a day, but a four-day workweek is a goal that fits with the party’s approach to changing the economy to the benefit of the workers and to the party’s overall strategy for industry.”
Labour would not be the first to support such an idea, as the Green Party proposed a four-day workweek during the 2017 parliamentary election campaign.
However, the goal is not supported unanimously by the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day working week is not party policy and is not under consideration in the party."
Labour shadow finance minister John McDonnell used last week’s party meeting to record his plans for a socialist economic revolution.
McDonnell says he is determined to pull power back from “anonymous CEOs” and “users” in utilities.
The shadow finance minister's plans also cast doubt on whether current shareholders in water utilities will get their money back, as a Labour-led government could "offset" them on the basis of immoral actions.
He also confirmed plans to get workers on company boards and to set up including equity funds to distribute 10 percent of private companies' share value to employees who are to receive up to <0xC2><0xA3>500 a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes if FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their vote
The FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the FBI’s findings could get the Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview that aired on Sunday, 60 Minutes journalist Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could dig out anything that could cause them to change their mind.
Kennedy appeared to be more open to the idea than his South Carolina counterpart.
“Yes, of course,” Kennedy said.
"As I entered the hearing, I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened – after the accusations came out – and said, “Did you do that?”
He was steel-bound, determined and clear."
Graham’s voice, on the other hand, seems to be chiseled in stone.
“I have decided with regard to Brett Kavanaugh, and anything else would require a very violent accusation,” he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know Brett denied it at the most powerful," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she mentioned could confirm it.
It happened 36 years ago.
I can’t see that that would change anything.”
What is the Global Citizens Festival, and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizens Festival – an annual music festival with a very impressive selection of artists and an equally impressive goal; to end the world’s poverty.
For the seventh time, the Global Citizens Festival will receive tens of thousands of people on Central Park’s Great Plain, where they can look forward to concerts with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes. At the same time, the festival will create awareness of the real goal, which is to end extreme poverty in 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival started in 2012 and is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy organization that fights to end poverty by increasing the number of active opponents.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (if you do not want to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must perform a number of tasks or "actions". For example, do volunteer work, write to a world leader, make a phone call or other meaningful action that can create awareness about the goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been now that they have 12 years left to reach their goal?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert create real change, or is it just another case of so-called “clicktivism” – that people feel they are making a difference by signing a petition online or making a Twitter post?
Global Citizen states that since 2011 they have recorded more than 19 million “actions” from their members aimed at different goals.
They believe that these actions have spurred world leaders to make binding goals and policies equivalent to more than $37 billion, which by 2030 is expected to have affected more than 2.25 billion people.
At the beginning of 2018, the group listed 390 goals and actions that had become due to their actions, which amounted to over $10 billion, which had already been disbursed or collected.
The group estimates that these funds have so far had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
One of the main goals is The Power of Nutrition, which was started in England and is a collaboration between investors and strong-willed people. They strive to “help children live up to their full potential” and promise $35 million to solve nutrition problems in Rwanda after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
“With the help of the UK government, donors, governments of other countries and world citizens like you, social injustice with malnutrition can become a footnote in the history books,” the Power of Nutrition ambassador, Tracey Ullman, told the audience at a London concert in April 2018.
The group also said that the UK government has now pledged funds to improve nutrition for mothers and children after receiving more than 5,000 calls online. This project, Power of Nutrition, will help five million mothers and children with nutrition advice.
In response to one of the website’s frequently asked questions, “What makes you think we can end extreme poverty?”,
Global Citizen wrote: “It’s going to be a long and hard battle, and sometimes we’ll stumble and make mistakes.
But as with the civil rights movement and the anti-apartheid movements, it will succeed because we are stronger together.”
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the performers at this year’s festival in New York. Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host.
U.S. could use navy to ‘block’ Russian energy exports, says U.S. Home Secretary
“If necessary, Washington can use its navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including in the Middle East,” U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke told the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia’s meddling in Syria – especially where they operate at the invitation of the rightful government – is a pretext for expanding the sale of their energy.
"I think they are in the Middle East because they want to sell energy, just like they do in Eastern and Southern Europe," he said.
And according to him, there are both methods and resources to prevent it.
“The United States has the ability with our navy to ensure that there is free passage on the sea lanes, and if necessary, we can also block them so that we ensure that their energy does not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke spoke to attendees at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit organization that views itself as “the voice of the American energy consumer.”
He compared Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they are basically the same.
“The economic opportunities in relation to Iran and Russia are about exploiting and replacing fuel,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one-trick pony” whose economy relies on fossil fuels.
These statements come after the Trump administration aimed to increase European exports of liquefied natural gas, which will replace Russia, which is by far the cheapest choice for European consumers.
To achieve this, Trump administration officials, including Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to pull out of the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion expensive Nord Stream 2 line, which is expected to double its current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin believes that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is an expression of unequal conditions of competition and is simply due to economic considerations.
“I think we share the view that energy should not be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should have the opportunity to choose a supplier,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said at a subsequent meeting in Moscow with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in September.
The position of the Americans is met by criticism from Germany, which has confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the BDI, has called on the US to interfere outside the EU’s energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem with a third party interfering in our energy supplies," BDI head Dieter Kempf said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren 'strongly considering' running for president in 2020 election, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren "considers strongly" running for president after midterm elections, she said Saturday.
During a town council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she was considering running.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and fix our political system, and that requires a woman in the front,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will strongly consider running for president.”
Warren gave his opinion on President Donald Trump during the city council and said that he is "leading the country in the wrong direction."
“I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been vocal in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren wrote: "Of course the FBI will have to investigate the matter before the vote."
However, a poll from Thursday shows that the majority of Warren’s own backyard doesn’t think she should run in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, 58% of "likely" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32% supported the possible candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for former Governor Deval Patrick with 38% for and 48% against a possible run-up.
Other high-profile Democratic candidates discussed in the 2020 presidential election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, among others.
Biden says he will announce his final decision in January, the Associated Press reports.
Sarah Palin mentions Track Palin’s PTSD at a voter meeting for Donald Trump
The 26-year-old Track Palin was in Iraq for a year after joining the army in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through after he gets home makes me relate to other families who feel the consequences of PTSD and other injuries that our soldiers are returning home with,” she told the audience at a Trump election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they have changed and have become harder. They go and think about whether there is respect for what their colleagues on land and in the air and all other members of the military have done for the country."
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence against a woman, for preventing the reporting of domestic violence, and for possessing a weapon in a drunken state, said Dan Bennet, a spokesman for Wasillas police.
18 states and D.C. support opposition to new asylum law
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal objection to a new U.S. law denying asylum to victims fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and D.C. delivered a party-independent statement in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the law, according to NBC News.
The plaintiff’s full name in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal law has not been made public.
She says her partner "and his violent sons who are gang members" had abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The state prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where a large number of U.S. asylum seekers come from, as countries with far-reaching problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum law overturned a decision made by the U.S. Aliens Council in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
The District of Columbia Attorney General, Karl Racine, said Friday that the new law "regards decades of state, federal and international law."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be determined on the basis of relevant facts and circumstances, and such an obstacle runs counter to that principle,” the party said in a statement.
The lawyers also argued in the statement that the law on rejected immigrants harms the U.S. economy, as they are more likely to become self-employed and “provide the necessary labor.”
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions stripped immigration judges of the right to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
“Asylum is offered to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear on the basis of race, religion, nationality or membership of a given social group or political position,” Sessions said in his ruling of the law on June 11.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems – or just all the serious problems – that people around the world face every day.
As the death toll doubles, attempts to find survivors in Palu become desperate
For the survivors, the situation only got worse.
“It’s very tense,” said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforted her feverish little boy at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every minute the ambulance comes in with a body.
We lack clean water.”
The residents now returned to their ruined home to sort into soaked possessions and save what they could find.
Several hundred people were injured and the hospitals, which were also affected by the 7.5 earthquake, could not keep up.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke his back and shoulder, were outside Palus Military Hospital, where patients are being treated outdoors due to severe aftershocks.
He got tears in his eyes when he told how the violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I was masturbated against a broken wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was going to a wedding in the city.
“I heard my wife screaming for help, but then it stopped.
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. Ambassador Accuses China of Unfair Methods and Propaganda Ads
A week after a Chinese newspaper carried a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper that hit the drum for the benefits of U.S.-Chinese cooperation, the U.S. ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to China Daily’s paid indentation in the Des Moines Register – Iowa’s best-selling newspaper – after accusing China of meddling in the Nov. 6 congressional election. China rejects the accusation.
U.S. officials say Trump’s accusations of Chinese meddling in the U.S. election mark a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are now locked in an escalating trade war, where they have repeatedly imposed tariffs on each other’s imports.
China’s retaliatory tariffs in the trade war would hit exporters in states like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party, according to Chinese and U.S. experts.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China's former governor for a number of years in Iowa, which is a major exporter of agricultural food to China, said Beijing has hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in a leader in Sunday's Des Moines Register that China is "emerging the use of the wrong methods by running propaganda ads in our own free press."
“By spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the proud American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom by running a paid ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
"In the kiosks here in Beijing, on the other hand, you will find few dissenting voices, and you will not get a fair picture of the different attitudes of the Chinese people towards China's worrying economic direction, as the media is under tight control of the Chinese Communist Party," he wrote.
He added that “one of China’s most prominent newspapers failed to publish” his article, though he did not say which one.
Republicans estrange women ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh case, analysts warn
While many top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh against allegations of sexual assault, analysts warn they will see a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The case has put the feelings in jeopardy, and most Republicans have already announced that they would like to see the voting process continue.
"This can't be done about," Grant Reher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article Saturday.
Reher said he doubted Republican Senator Jeff Flakes’ (Arizona) request for an 11-hour FBI investigation would soften anger voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday – they don’t forget it tomorrow or in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told The Hill on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted during a Senate demonstration: “November is coming!” as the Republicans, who control the Judiciary Committee, chose to move forward with Kavanaugh’s nomination despite the testimony of Professor Christine Blasey Ford.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will reach new heights,” independent political commentator Stu Rothenberg told the news media.
"People say it's already reached a high level; it's true.
But it can reach even higher, especially among female suburban swing voters and younger voters — 18-29-year-olds — who rarely vote, despite not liking the president.
Even before Ford’s public accusations of the Supreme Court nominee’s sexual assault, analysts had pointed out that it could backfire if the Republicans continued with the nomination.
“It’s become a worse mess for the Republicans,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said at the start of last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the committee’s vote or the final result, or whether Kavanaugh is held accountable; it’s also about how the Republicans handled it here and how they treated her,” said Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a group that supports Democrats in getting elected.
But Americans seem to have shared views on who to believe after the Ford and Kavanaugh testimony, where the latter has a little more on his side.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41% of respondents certainly or probably believed Ford’s testimony, while 35% said they certainly or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38% said they believed Kavanaugh was either likely or certainly lying during his testimony, while only 30% said the same about Ford.
At the request of Flake, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other person, writes Deborah Ramirez for The Guardian.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals at a party when they were both studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the Internet plans to create a new Internet and compete with Google and Facebook
The inventor of the Internet, Tim Berners-Lee, is launching a new company to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project is called Inrupt and is a company based on Berners-Lee’s open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the plan with Inrupt is "world domination".
“We’re going to have to do it now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology so people can create their own “personal online data collection” or a POD.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries, and other personal and professional tools.
It is as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were available in a single browser at the same time.
What is unique about the personal online data collection is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access the specific information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through data.”
The idea with Inrupt is, according to the company’s CEO, John Bruce, to gather resources, processes and capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some software developers on project contracts, and a community of volunteer programmers.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inrupt’s website.
Berners-Lee says he and his team don’t talk to Facebook or Google about whether they should change everything completely so that all their business models suddenly become redundant.
“We don’t ask for your permission.”
In a post on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt’s “mission is to offer commercial energy and an ecosystem that can ensure the integrity and quality of the new internet being built on Solid.”
In 1994, Berners-Lee changed the internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an important voice in the so-called net neutrality debate.
While Inrupt is launched, Berners-Lee will continue to be the inventor and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web Foundation and Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic about the next period of the internet,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Venerable recipient of the Victoria Cross from the First World War celebrated
The only priest of the Church of England to win the Victoria Cross by fighting in World War I will be celebrated in his hometown 100 years later.
Colonel and priest Bernard Wann won the Order on September 29, 1918, during the attack at Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed four days later by a sniper and was never told that he had won the highest English military order.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northhamptonshire.
Michael Vann, one of his grandchildren, said it was "incredibly symbolic" that the stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's orderly achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt. Col. Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from machine guns and artillery."
He later ran to the front line and led his people forward with the "greatest manly courage" before alone attacking an artilleryman and incapacitating three guns.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I knew I could never live up to but that makes me humble.”
He and his brother James Vann also made a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he "felt very honored to participate in the parade" and added that "the support of all these people underscores the true heroism."
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206, but instead got Gurli Gris
Imagine that you’ve been up all night to watch the star-studded Bellator 206 and then are denied seeing the main event.
There were 13 games on the program from San Jose, including six games on the main program, and they were shown throughout the night in England on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald prepared to meet, viewers in England were somewhat surprised when the transmission switched to show Gurli Gris.
Some were unimpressed after they had stayed awake until early morning for this particular fight.
A fan on Twitter described the switch to a children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke."
“According to the legislation, this content was inappropriate at 6 a.m., so they had to switch to children’s programs,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president when asked about the broadcast.
"'Grisen Gurli', yes."
Bellator’s CEO, Scott Coker, stated that they will work to include English viewers in the planning in the future.
“When I think about the rebroadcast, I think we can make it work,” Coker said.
"But it's six o'clock on Sunday morning over there, and we can't find a solution to it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was changed, I got a lot of messages, and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
In fact, it was the law.
I promise you, it won’t happen next time.
We only got five games instead of six, which we usually do, and we tried to give our fans something extra, and then we went over time.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley had 'minority' over sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that it didn’t come up to him until he got into the bigger classes that “everyone is not like me.”
When he was on Radio 4's first Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he was talking about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said he was less interested in winning the Olympics after becoming a parent.
The regular host on the long-running radio show, Kirsty Young, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley was a guest on Laverne's first program and said he felt "less worthy" than everyone else in his upbringing because "it was not socially accepted to like boys and girls."
He said, “Until today, the feelings of feeling worth remembering and feeling different have been the things that have given me the strength to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so he didn’t disappoint everyone when they got to know his sexuality.
The double Olympic bronze medallist has become a high-profile LGBT fighter and used her participation at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal for a decriminalization of homosexuality in several countries.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without negative consequences, and he would give others “hope.”
The triple world champion said he had been “surprised” when he fell in love with a man – the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013.
Daley last year married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, but said the age difference had never been a problem.
He said it’s hard to find someone the same age who has experienced similar ups and downs when going through so much at such a young age – he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later.
The couple became parents in June to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "his whole perspective" had changed.
“If you had asked me last year, it would all be about me winning a gold medal,” he said.
“But there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie."
His son has the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father did not accept his death, and one of the last things he asked was whether they had received tickets to London in 2012 – when he would be in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there at the time.
I held his hand when his breathing stopped, and it first dawned on me that he wasn’t immortal when he stopped breathing and was dead.”
The following year, Daley participated in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I just knew that’s what I’d been dreaming about all my life – diving in front of a home crowd at the Olympics. There was nothing that could beat that feeling,” he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first selection of songs – Proud by Heather Small – which had meant a lot during the run-up to the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs will run on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 BST.
Uskarp Mickelson on the bench for Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson sets a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he must do something about the form if it is not to be a sad milestone.
Mickelson, who sets a record by entering the competition for the 12th time, which takes place every 2 years, was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk due to Saturday's fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being at the center of events for the United States as usual, the five-time great winner had to act cheering and practice his game in the hope of correcting the slips.
Even not at the height of his career, he had the most straight drive, which is why the 48-year-old is not a perfect match for the course at Le Golf National, where the long rough often punish stray shots.
And if the field was not a big enough mouthful, Mickelson will at the ninth match on Sunday meet the always accurate winner of the British Open Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans who start the 12 singles games start strong, Mickelson’s game could be crucial.
Furyk did not express surprising confidence in his teammate.
"He understood his role completely today, slapped me on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
“He has a lot of faith in himself.”
He is in the Hall of Fame and has given so much to these teams before – and also this week.
I didn’t think he would play two games.
I thought he was going to play more, but that’s how it was and that’s how it was supposed to be.
He wants to be out there like everyone else.”
On Sunday, Mickelson beat Nick Faldo's record for most games played in the Ryder Cup.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched his individual performance.
Mickelson has 18 victories, 20 defeats and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence contributes something indefinable.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's witty, he likes to stick to people, and he's good to have in the team room," he explained.
"I also think the younger players had fun playing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He contributes much more than just the game.”
Europe’s Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that great leadership can quickly disappear
European captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows from experience that a solid lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup singles event can quickly become nerve-wracking.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points over the Americans, but was just about to be caught before the finish line with a win of 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2.
“You keep reminding yourself that we had a nice lead in Valderrama, we had a nice lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we just won,” says Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn after watching the 2018 team win both 5-6 on Friday and yesterday for a total lead of 10-6 at Le Golf National.
The story tells me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
It's supposed to be full of garbage tomorrow.
Go out and do the right thing.
It's not over until you have the points on the board.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win the trophy, and that is where our focus is.
I’ve always said that I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re also aware of what’s on the other side – the best golfers in the world.”
Satisfied with his player’s performance on a difficult pitch, Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn added: “I don’t take any of this for granted.
Tomorrow is a whole new challenge.
Tomorrow it is the individual performance that counts, and it is something completely different.
It’s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re out there alone, you’re tested on all parameters as a golfer.
That’s what players need to understand – get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you must leave your partner, for he must also get the best out of himself.”
Otherwise, it looks like the opponent Jim Furyk, who hopes for better individual performance than in the partner game with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three out of four points.
Furyk himself has experienced twists on the last day. First on the winning team in Brookline, before losing when Europe made the "Miracle at Medinah".
“I remember every word,” he said when asked how Captain Ben Crenshaw had spoken to his players in 1999 before the last day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want a good start, as you saw at Brookline, as you saw at Medinah.
Once momentum has found a direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the mid-games.
We’re putting our team together in relation to that and putting the players on the pitch in the order we feel like we’re trying to create magic tomorrow.”
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the relegation and faces Rory McIlroy in the top game, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and the other Europeans play in the first half of the order.
“I chose this group of players in this order because I think it secures us all the way through,” Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn said of his choice of single players.
Germany's new warship to be delayed again
The German Navy’s newest frigate was supposed to have been ready in 2014 to replace Cold War warships. But the Germans must wait at least another year due to technical problems and an escalating price, local media reported.
The deployment of the largest ship in the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg class of frigates, "Rheinland-Palatinate", has been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit, citing a spokesman from the military.
The ship was supposed to have become part of the fleet in 2014, but delivery problems have plagued the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered back in 2007 will replace the ageing Bremen-class frigates.
About them, it is known that they want a powerful cannon, a wide range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Another important feature of the latest frigates is a smaller need for maintenance: it should be possible to have the frigates away from home ports for up to two years.
But the repeated delays mean that the advanced warships – which are said to make Germany look like an overseas power factor – will already be obsolete when deployed, Die Zeit writes.
The failed F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy delivered a ship back to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Not much was known about the reasons for the return, but German media cited a number of crucial "software and hardware flaws" that rendered the warship unusable in combat situations.
Software errors were of particular importance, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships were to be controlled by a crew of 120 sailors – that’s only half the crew of the older Bremen frigates.
It also turned out that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy's ability for future updates.
The 7000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" is said to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to hardware failure, the price of the project, which includes training the crew, is also becoming a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion ($3.6 billion), with an initial price of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
The problems with the latest frigates are becoming even more important in light of recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German government's defence committee, admitted earlier this year that the fleet "is running out of ready-to-lay ships."
The official said the problem has grown over time because the old ships were taken out of service without being replaced.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were ready to join the fleet.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
New research from an area in the Scottish Highlands is trying to reveal how bats use the landscape when hunting.
The hope is that the findings will shed light on the unique behaviour of flying mammals and will help in the work on future conservation efforts.
The study is conducted by scientists from the National Trust of Scotland and follows common bats, dwarf bats, long-eared bats and water bats at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recording equipment is placed in carefully selected locations in the area to record bat activities throughout the season.
Data is also collected from NTS staff and volunteers using handheld detectors.
In-depth analysis of the sound recordings will reveal the frequencies of the bat calls and show which species does what.
To produce a detailed landscape view of their behavior, a report and a map of the habitat are made.
NTS Conservation Advisor Rob Dewar hopes the findings will reveal which areas of habitat are most important and how they are used by the different species.
This knowledge can help determine the benefits of habitat conservation efforts such as the establishment of meadows, and how to best conserve forest areas for bats and similar species.
The number of bats in Scotland and the UK has fallen drastically over the last 100 years.
They are threatened by buildings and urban expansion projects that affect shipowners and restrict their habitat.
Windmills and lighting can also pose a danger, as can fly traps, chemical treatment of building materials and attacks from pets.
In fact, bats are not blind.
But because they primarily hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes.
They use an advanced echolocation technique to find insects and fly around obstacles.
NTS, which is responsible for the conservation of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes bats very seriously.
They have ten trained experts who often collect data, inspect ships, and sometimes perform rescue operations.
The organisation has even made Scotland’s first and only dedicated bat reserve in the area around Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight out of ten of Scotland’s bat species.
The area’s manager, David Thompson, says it’s an ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threeave we have a really good area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, a lot of old trees and all the good habitat.
There’s a lot you don’t know about bats, so working here and elsewhere can help you understand what they need to thrive.”
He stresses the importance of looking for bats before doing maintenance tasks on properties, as the destruction of a single nest can kill up to 400 females and cubs, risking wiping out an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, annoy or disturb them or their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish project manager for the Bat Conservation Trust, has called on the public to lend a hand.
She said, “We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and for many of the species we have, we don’t know how populations develop.”
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges, Lawyers Sue German Journal
Cristiano Ronaldo has called rape charges against him “fake news” and says people will “promote themselves” by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German news media Der Spiegel, which brought the accusations.
The attacker from Portugal and Juventus has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid her $375,000 to keep it a secret, Der Spiegel wrote on Friday.
A few hours after the allegations were made public, 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live and criticized the information for being “fake news”.
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner told the camera.
“They will promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
They'll be famous for saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is good," added the player smiling.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they have called “an unforgivable disclosure of suspicions about the privacy sphere.”
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player would seek compensation for "moral corruption in a class similar to the accusation, which is arguably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The incident allegedly took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to the report filed in the Clark County, Nevada, city court.
Mayorga claims that Ronald fell to his knees after the alleged incident and said he was "a good guy 99% of the time" gripped by "the one percent".
The lawsuit alleges that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that there was consent to it.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and got photographed her injuries in a hospital, but that she later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "banned for retaliation" and worried about being "publicly disgraced".
The 34-year-old now says she will renegotiate the deal as she is still deeply affected by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo faced a move from Manchester United to Real Madrid when the event was due to take place, and this summer switched to the Italian club Juventus for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million.
Brexit: UK 'will regret forever' losing car manufacturers
Britain “will regret it forever” if it loses its status as the world’s leading car manufacturer after Brexit, said Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily lower production at the Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said longer wait times at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston factory, which produces Toyota’s Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
“As I see it, production will stop at our factory if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March,” said Marvin Cooke, chief executive of Burnaston.
Other UK car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, are concerned about leaving the EU without a cross-border trade deal.
For example, BMW says they will close their Mini factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of car manufacturers is the risks associated with the supply chain in the event of a no-deal exit.
Toyota’s production runs on a tight schedule, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the UK leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March, border problems could arise, which, according to the automotive industry, could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day’s production at the Derbyshire factory, and then production would be stopped.
Clark says Theresa May's Chequers plan for future negotiations with the EU is "composed to precisely avoid these border checks."
“We want the best deal that not only allows us – as I call it – to enjoy our current success, but to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme.
“The feedback from Toyota and other manufacturers indicates that we need to be able to continue what has been successful supply chains.”
Toyota could not say how long production would have stopped, but in the longer term higher prices would reduce the factory’s competitiveness, which would ultimately cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallais, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is a joint trustee at the factory, says that his members are becoming more and more concerned: “My experience tells me that as soon as these jobs disappear, they won’t come back.”
A government spokesman said: "We have proposed an accurate and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU."
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may “be postponed for another week” as the tally around Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein looks over the shoulder of Special Counsel Robert Mueller during his investigation into Russian election interference, connections between Trump’s aides and Russia and the president’s possible obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Attorney General and thereby risk Mueller’s independence has been a topic of contention in Washington for months.
The New York Times wrote earlier this month that Rosenstein was considering wearing a microphone to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of deposing the president via the 25th paragraph.
Rosenstein denied the news.
But last Monday he went to the White House, and the rumor was that he would resign.
Instead, a meeting was arranged Thursday with Trump, who was at the UN headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he would "prefer not" to fire Rosenstein. But the meeting was delayed to avoid a coincidence with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who have accused him of sexual assault, would testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying the Senate election.
Trump’s press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: "There is no date set. It could be this week. I can also imagine that it could be pushed a week with all that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we have to see, and I always like to keep the press up to date.”
Some journalists would challenge that claim: Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked her why.
Sanders said the lack of press meetings was not due to TV journalists playing for the gallery, but added, "I don't disagree that they're playing up to the camera."
She then said that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
“The president accepts more questions from the press than any president before him,” she said, adding without citing a source, “We’ve looked at the numbers.”
Press meetings will still take place, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask direct questions to the president of the United States, it’s infinitely much better than talking to me.
We're trying to give it a chance, and you've seen us do it over the last few weeks, and it's going to be at the press conference when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump often accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open hearings or press meetings with high-ranking guests.
Press meetings with Trump alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, when he made an improvised and at times mysterious figure in front of the journalists present.
Health Minister contacts EU health officials in Scotland after Brexit concerns <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
The Minister of Health has written to the EU staff working in Scotland’s NHS to express the country’s gratitude and desire that they stay after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain withdrew from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed itself to paying for applications for permanent residence for EU citizens working in its delegated public sector.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal are ongoing and it appears that decisions are expected in the autumn.
But the British government has also stepped up their preparations for a possible no-deal Brexit.
I know this must be a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate how much I appreciate the efforts made by each employee, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from and outside the EU bring valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and enhances healthcare work for the benefit of patients and the local community.
Scotland is definitely your home and we would love you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie gets emergency surgery after head injury
The linebacker from the Tennessee State Tigers, Christion Abercrombie was acutely operated after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to the Tennessee Mike Organ.
Tennessee State’s first coach, Rod Reed, told reporters that the incident took place before the break.
“He went out to the sidelines and just fell over out there,” Reed said.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on a stretcher and taking him in for further examination.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie’s operation at Vanderbilt Medical Center was over.
Harris added that there are “no details about the type or extent of the damage yet,” and Tennessee State is trying to find out when he sustained the damage.
Abercrombie is studying for her second year and is starting her first season in Tennessee after a shift from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before leaving the game, giving him 18 tackles collected this season.
Foreign buyers are charged a higher stamp duty when buying a house in the UK
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK. The extra money, according to the Conservative party, will help the homeless.
This move is intended to dampen Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters.
The higher stamp duty will hit those who do not pay tax in the UK.
The Ministry of Finance expects that it will provide <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to the homeless.
Theresa May will today propose that foreign buyers be charged a higher stamp duty when buying properties in the UK, for the benefit of the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter Jeremy Corbyn’s success in attracting young voters with promises of cheaper housing and going after those with the highest incomes.
The increase in the stamp duty will affect people and businesses who do not pay tax in the UK. The earnings from this must be used for the government's fight to ensure that everyone has a place to sleep.
The surcharge, which is added to the current stamp duty and the higher levels introduced two years ago on multi-home purchases and rental purchases, can reach up to 3%.
The Ministry of Finance expects it to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new buildings in London are bought by people living abroad, which makes prices rise and makes it harder for first-time buyers to gain a foothold in the housing market.
Many rich areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become "ghost towns" due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new bill comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed a cut in the stamp duty to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping property prices up by buying land they do not use. He asked May to drop quotas on cheap housing to solve Britain's "shameful housing situation."
Corbyn has proposed an eye-catching range of housing reforms, including controlling rents and removing the landlord’s ability to put people on the street if they comply with the lease.
He will also strengthen the possibility of building public housing structures.
May said: "Last year I said I would use my presidency to restore the British dream; that life will be better for every generation.
And that means repairing our non-functioning housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
But it may not be as easy for foreign companies and people living outside the UK to buy homes as it is for hard-working Britons.
For too many, the dream of owning a home has become too remote, and the unworthiness of sleeping on the street is still far too widespread.”
Jack Ross: ‘My ultimate goal is to become Scotland’s coach’
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate goal" is at some point to become Scotland's coach.
The 42-year-old enjoys the challenge of reviving the club from the North East, which now has third place in League One, three points from the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after looking for St Mirren back in the Scottish Premiership last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
"I played a game with the B team, and that's it," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland on Hampden with my father when I was a kid, and it’s always drawn in me.
However, that opportunity would only arise if I succeed in training clubs.”
Ross' predecessors as coach for Sunderland are Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic coach says he had no concerns about following such established names in such a big club and had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now I measure success by whether I can get this club back in the Premier League.
Based on the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task, but I will probably only see myself as successful here if I can get the club back there.”
Ross is only three years into his career as a coach after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and a 15-month failure as part of Heart’s coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa come back after being pulled down in the third-best row and transformed St Mirren from the relegation threat to the title winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did during his career playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a real divide," he recalls of the time in Alloa.
“I honestly thought the coaching act was right for me, more right than being a player.
It sounds strange because I managed well, served sensibly and had some success experiences.
But it can be hard to play.
There are many things you need to go through on a weekly basis.
There’s still that kind of stress and pressure as a coach, but it just feels right.
I've always wanted to train, and now I'm doing it, and I haven't had a more comfortable time with myself in my adult life."
You can listen to the full interview on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12.00 and 13.00 BST.
The best time for a beer is on Saturdays at 5:30 p.m., study shows
The heatwave this summer has increased earnings for England’s pubs, but has put restaurant chains under more pressure.
Sales at pubs and bars rose by 2.7% in July, while sales at restaurants have fallen 4.8%, figures show.
Peter Martin, a business consultant at CGA who has collected the figures, said: "Continuing sunshine and England's unexpectedly long World Cup has meant that July follows the June pattern where the pubs experienced a 2.8% increase in sales, except that the restaurants are now hit harder.
The drop of 1.8% in restaurants in June only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on the sale of beverages clearly performed best and experienced progress corresponding to the decline of restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food suffered in the sun, but not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that people just want something to drink.
Across pub and bar chains, sales of beverages rose by 6.6% per month, while food dropped by 3.3%."
Paul Newman, who analyzes the service industry, said: “The results continue the trend we’ve seen since the end of April.
When it comes to selling on the outdoor market, weather and major social or sports events are the biggest factors.
It’s no surprise that restaurants are still struggling, even though a 4.8% drop in sales year after year will really hurt in addition to rising costs.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for the food industry, and only time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we have had in August will provide a much-needed breathing space.”
The total increase in total sales for pubs and restaurants including new openings was 2.7% in July, showing the decline in newly launched brands.

One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
One in five children – up to 11 years old – have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 schoolchildren in grades 4-9 reveals growth in “fake Insta” pages.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being added
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they can show their parents
One in five children under the age of 11 create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 students from the 4th grade onwards reveals tremendous growth in “fake Insta” accounts – a reference to the photo-sharing service Instagram.
The news has increased the fear of sexual content being added.
20% of students said they have a “main account” that they can show their parents while also having private ones.
A mother who fell on her 13-year-old daughter’s secret account saw a teenager who urged others to “rape me.”
The survey, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) for private schools, found that 40% of 11-18-year-olds had two profiles, half of which admitted to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of HMC, said: “It’s scary that so many teenagers are tempted to make online profiles where their parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the “voice of the athletes” on the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors.
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors at the Governing Body’s Annual General Meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful athlete, and President Ian Bettie described the move as a good opportunity for those making decisions about sport to benefit from her vast 10-year experience at the international level.
“Eilidh enjoys great standing in the athletic world in Scotland, the UK and the rest of the world, and we are confident that athletics in Scotland will be able to benefit from having her on the board,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I will try to be the voice of the athletes and I hope that I can contribute and help to forge a direction for sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won two of his four Olympic gold medals in the 200-meter and 400-meter races at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics and is now a frequent commentator for the BBC, could not go after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "A month ago, I was struck by a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that time would show if I would get on top of it and to what extent.
It has been hard work, but I am completely healthy, have learned to walk again and do agility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!"
Advertising for breast pump that compares mothers to cows, gets mixed reception online
A breast pump company has shared the opinions online with an ad that compares nursing mothers to cows being milked.
To mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump,” the tech consumer magazine has released a sarcastic music video-inspired ad that aims to show the freedom the new pump gives mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a food hall filled with hay to a song in which it reads: "Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail" and "If you hadn't noticed it, this is not beyond, it's my breasts."
“Pump it out, pump it out, I feed my baby, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my breast.”
However, the advertisement, which has been published on the company’s Facebook page, has caused controversy online.
With 77,000 views and several hundred comments, the video has received a mixed reception from viewers. Many say that it makes fun of the "terrors" of the dairy industry.
"Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth before they can produce milk, except that their babies are stolen from them shortly after birth.”

Another wrote: “Understandably traumatic enough for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump to mothers who are allowed to keep their children?”
Another added: "What an insensitive advertisement."
Others defended the commercial. One woman admitted that she thought the song was "incredibly funny."
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
If I was still breastfeeding, I would have had one.
Breastfeeding made me feel exactly like a cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
“It’s a great product,” one wrote.
Another commented: “It’s a fun ad aimed at mothers who pump milk (often at their workplace or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not an advertisement that praises or criticizes the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they have danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the ad is based on the fact that many women who are breastfeeding say they feel like cows.
The pump from Elvie is completely silent, has no tubes or hoses and fits discreetly in a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their children and even walk out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, Partner and CEO of Mother, wrote: “The pump from Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between nursing mothers and dairy cows, we would focus on the challenges of breast pumping, while showing in an entertaining and recognisable way the freedom that the new pump can provide.”
This isn't the first time Elvie's pump has made headlines.
In London Fashion Week, a mother went for two catwalks for Marta Jakubowski while she was using the product.
Hundreds of Migrant Children Secretly Moved to Tent Camp at Texas Border
The number of detained migrant children has exploded, although the number of border crossings has not changed. This is due in part to harsher rhetoric and the Trump administration’s harsher laws that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they have feared for their ability to stay in the country by standing up and accepting a child.
The risk of sending home rose in June, when authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of the household would be providing fingerprints, and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified to Congress and said they had arrested several people seeking to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The administration later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had clean criminal records.
“Nearly 80% of those who are either sponsors or members of the sponsor’s households are staying illegally in the country, and a large proportion of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still chasing those people," Albence said.
In an attempt to deal with children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of their detention. Before that, it was within 60 days, aid workers say.
Many people use video calls instead of appearing and speaking their case for legal residence to an immigration judge.
Those who are found to be unfit to stay are quickly deported.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to experience anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outcomes or attempted escape, according to aid workers and reports that have emerged from the system in recent months.
People who advocate for better relationships say these risks are more pronounced at larger facilities like Tornillo, where the size makes it harder to keep track of whether a child is suffering.
They added that moving to a tent village without mental preparation or the opportunity to say goodbye to friends can accumulate trauma that many are already struggling with.
Syria announces U.S., French and Turkish “occupation forces” to withdraw immediately
When Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem addressed the UN General Assembly, he asked Syrian refugees to return home, even though the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said the stay of foreign forces in the country is illegal and under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and they will "be met with similar means."
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally," he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror “is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and several million have fled their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to "fight this crucial war until we have cleared all Syrian areas" of both terrorist groups and "illegal foreign presence".
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn country.
In the refugee area, Moualem said conditions were good enough for them to return home, after which he accused "some Western countries" of "spreading unfounded fears" that caused the refugees to leave.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help facilitate these repatriations,” he said.
"They're politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter."
The United States and the European Union have warned that no aid will be provided to rebuild the country until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Syria to create a buffer zone in the last major rebel-held city of Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
Due to the agreement between Russia and Turkey, a major attack by Syrian forces, supported by Russia, was avoided against the province where three million live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal had “clear deadlines” and expressed hope that military action would go after jihadists from the Nusra Front, an outpost group of al-Qaeda that “will be wiped out.”
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of the new committee soon to outline a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for an election. The committee consists of government and opposition members.
Moualem has set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "reviewing the legislation in the current constitution," and warned against interference.
Trump wins another presidential term.
Based on that logic, Trump is likely to be re-elected in 2020, unless the impeachment trial and scandals end his presidential term prematurely, which many liberal viewers are hoping for.
In what will undoubtedly be "The most dramatic ending to a presidential term ever!"
Currently, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, the number of viewers in the best broadcast time has almost doubled for CNN to 1.05 million and almost tripled to 1.6 million for MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time compared to 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen. MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show has the most viewers with up to 3.5 million on big news evenings.
“It’s a spectacle that people are drawn to because it’s not something we understand,” said Neal Baer, who heads the ABC drama Designated Survivor about a cabinet leader who becomes president after an attack destroys the convention building.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedy writer and writer behind Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club, has another theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
“Why?” she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell said.
Kaosset has entertainment value.
But unlike all other TV shows, the stories that come from Washington can decide the case between Roe and Wade, whether refugee families can be reunited and the health of the world economy.
Switching channels are only the most privileged ones.
And yet it’s about more than being an enlightened citizen when you see six-hour panel debate where experts discuss Bob Woodward’s use of “deep background” when he wrote his book “Fear”; Paul Manafort’s ostrich leather jacket for $15,000 (“clad with hybris,” wrote The Washington Post) and the implications of Stormy Daniel’s life.
I will never see Super Mario in the same way.
“One of the things that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of “Pawn Stars,” about the Trump show’s rotating crew and daily surprises.
But if you miss a paragraph, you're done.
When I got hold of Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside and watching MSNBC while he was filming CNN.
He could not force himself away; not with Brett Kavanaugh to be heard in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court to be decided.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows back in the day, and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right."

Big sums find their way to the close midterm elections to the House of Representatives
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district receives large sums of money. As a result of a settlement of two "Congressional Districts", two members of Congress are fighting for the same seat.
This recently revamped suburban district in Pittsburgh is causing problems for Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a second special election last spring.
Lamb opposes another sitting congressman, Republican Keith Rothfus, who now represents Pennsylvania's 12th district, which heavily overlaps with the new 17.
The cards were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district was unlawfully set up in favor of the Republicans.
The fight for the new 17th district has started a fight for financial means between the major party committees, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a high-stakes election in March's special election for Pennsylvania's 18th district.
The seat has been in Republican hands for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political commentators give the Democrats a small advantage.
The U.S. was considering punishing El Salvador for aiding China, but changed its mind.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing with few protests from Washington.
Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama until partners ousted Trump’s management team.
State Department officials decided to recall leading U.S. diplomats from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama after “the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan,” Heather Nauert, the State Department’s spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
But it was only El Salvador that was punished. They received approximately $140 million from the United States in 2017 for drug control, development and financial support.
The proposed penalties, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on entry permits, would have been painful for the Central American country with its high unemployment and murder statistics.
As the internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials postponed a summit on security and economic development, which should have continued last year's meeting, considered a step towards preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
But in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place anyway, thus dropping the considerations of punishment to El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October to send a signal about the importance that Americans place in the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys secretly flew back to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic with no new harsh demands or punishment from Washington.
A White House spokesman declined to comment on the details of the case, which were described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who would like to discuss internal considerations if they remained anonymous.
Their descriptions were confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Know the history
The next obstacle could very well be the special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of the investigation, which is considerable and publicly available evidence.
Mueller is also said to be directing his investigation into whether Trump’s campaign secretly cooperated with Russia on the attack on the election.
If Congress were to come to terms, Trump would likely be held accountable as he prepares to meet voters again and eventually, of course, a jury of his peers.
There are many uncertainties, and I’m not claiming that Trump’s finality is inevitable – and the same goes for his counterparts in Europe.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we must all make choices that will affect how long the fight will continue.
In 1938, German officers were ready to launch a coup d'état against Hitler if only the West could resist him by supporting the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not seize the opportunity to avoid the years-long bloodshed thereafter.
It is around such turning points that the axis of history turns, and the inevitable march of democracy to or from.
In the United States, we are now facing several of these turning points.
What do we do if Trump fires the man who decides the future of Mueller’s investigation, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein?
Rosenstein’s seat has been hot since this paper was able to announce that last year he had proposed making hidden recordings of the president and challenged his suitability for office.
According to Rosenstein, The Times' production is inaccurate.
“How do we respond if F.B.I.’s recently requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is suspended or not properly conducted – or if he is cleared to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and false testimony?
And, more importantly, will we in the midterm vote for a congress that will hold Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, it will be a long winter for democracy.
But because of what I learned in Prague, I believe we can do it.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the homeland of my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath lights on the table with the garden cross.
How can I be anything but optimistic about it in my luggage?”

Graham Dorrans from Rangers is optimistic ahead of the match against SK Rapid Wien
Rangers take on SK Rapid Wien on Thursday. After the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier in the month, they with a victory against the Austrians will have good opportunities to move on from Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his season debut before the 2-2 game against Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a springboard for something even bigger.
“It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team,” said the 31-year-old.
“We went to the game with the belief that we could get something home and we got a point.
Maybe we could have gone home, but all in all, it was probably a reasonable result.
They were probably the best in the first half, but we came out in the second half and were the best team.
Thursday will be another great European night.
We hope to get three points, but it will be difficult because they got a good result in the last game, but with the audience behind us I am sure that we can put pressure on them and get a good result.
The last year has been tough because of everything that has happened with my injuries and the changes in the club, but the mood is good now.
The team is good and the boys really enjoy it. We train well.
Hopefully we can run on now, put the last season behind us and be successful.”
Fear of retirement savings makes women sleepless
Despite the fact that the study participants had a firm idea of how they wanted to be cared for, only a few spoke to the family about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationswide study said they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
“Most people want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t do anything to start the conversation,” says Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationswide’s life insurance business.
That's how you get started.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to take care of you if you don’t tell them in time about your wishes.
Use your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you will receive care. These choices can be crucial factors for the cost.
Ask your financial advisor: Your advisor can also help you figure out how to pay for the expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, among other things, by means of traditional long-term care insurance, life insurance with cash payments or self-insurance with your own funds – as long as you have the finances for it.
Get the legal documents sorted: Take the legal battles in the run-up.
Have a power of attorney drafted so that you can have a trusted person handle your medical treatment and make sure that doctors and nurses comply with your wishes in the event that you are unable to communicate yourself.
Also consider an economic power of attorney.
In this case, you appoint a trusted person who can make financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you do not have the opportunity to do so yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that one of your aging parents is in urgent need of medical attention and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Get all these details down in writing so you’re ready.
“It’s not just a question of economics – who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
"What medicine?
Who will take care of the dog?
Get the plan in place."
Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home from a walk in the city.
The victim was in the 1940s and was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, diaphragm and hand.
Officers described the shooting, which took place at about 2:30 a.m., as "totally random."
The victim did not see the perpetrator.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and police are urging witnesses to come forward.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed by a massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities say, expecting the death toll to rise.
As communication roads are out of play, emergency workers have been unable to receive information from the Donggala regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the earthquake hit.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province and is located at the bottom of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, which in 2017 had an estimated population of 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that extends over more than 300 km of coastline on the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The government, which is an administrative region under a province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the cornerstones of the Central Sulawesi economy, particularly in the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but takes place mainly in Morowali, which is the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to Indonesia’s disaster centre, Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed several hundred houses in Donggala.
In 1996, Donggala was hit again by a tsunami that killed nine.
Indonesia is located seismologically on the so-called fire ring in the Pacific Ocean and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years have been:
2004: A massive earthquake on the west coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that affected 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, including more than half of those in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit Sumatra's west coast in late March and only in April.
Hundreds died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake measuring 6.8 struck south of Java, Indonesia’s most densely populated island, triggering a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of 7.6 struck near the city of Padang, the capital of western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake measuring 7.5 struck one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake struck Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, spreading destruction and panic as the population was reminded of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 were killed by the collapsing buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit Indonesia’s tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested for violence.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence reporting, and to resist arrest, according to the report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance when she tried to report the alleged crime.
Palin is being held in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility with a $500 security deposit without security, KTUU reports.
He was brought to court on Saturday, where he pleaded "clearly not guilty," the network reports.
Palin is charged with three Class A offences, which could result in a prison sentence of up to a year and a fine of $250,000.
He has also been charged with a Class B offense, which could lead to a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending before the Alaskan Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of a violent crime at home, as well as possession of weapons in an affected state in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by veteran groups for explaining her son’s violent behavior with PTSD as a result of his deployment to Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: several hundred dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake measured 7.5 and triggered a tsunami that destroyed several hundred homes.
The area is without electricity and communication roads, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just south of central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
On social media, videos are circulating showing the moment the earthquake hit.
Several hundred people were gathered for a beach party in the town of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Public Prosecutors Try to Get NYC Terrorist Suspects Sentenced to Rare Death Penalty
Public prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people — a rare punishment that was last convicted of a crime in the state in 1953.
In October, Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rental car from the Home Depot construction market to carry out an attack on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where pedestrians and cyclists who got in the way were cut off.
As a basis for the death penalty, the prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed the eight victims and "intentionally" caused serious personal injury. This is required by the declaration of intent for the death penalty in the southern district of New York.
According to the court document, the death penalty is a possible result of both these charges.
Several weeks after the attack, a state jury was able to present Saipov with a 22-point indictment, including eight counts of murder in connection with gangster activities, typically used by public prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and one charge of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "comprehensive planning and preparation," the prosecutors said, describing Saipov's execution as "cruel, vicious and depraved."
"Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov caused personal injury, bodily injury and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since New York’s Southern District last raised defendants in a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug suppliers, but ended up receiving a life sentence in September 2009.
In 1953, the couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted of espionage on behalf of the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov hailed from Uzbekistan and, according to the legal documents, showed no signs of regret in the days and months after the attack.
According to police, he told investigators that he was fine with his actions.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to commit the attack by watching ISIS videos on his phone.
He also asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room, the officers said.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts in the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov's public defenders, said they were "of course disappointed" by the prosecutors' decision.
“We believe that the decision to go after the death penalty and not accept a confession and life imprisonment without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma for all those involved,” Patton said.
Saipov’s lawyers had previously asked the charges not to go after the death penalty.
Conservative minister says Nigel Farage should take over Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the people's army" during a demonstration at the Conservative meeting today.
The former Ukip leader said politicians needed to “feel the pressure” from eurosceptics – after one of Theresa May’s own ministers had said Farage should take over negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at the demonstration in Birmingham that Britain would have "been out now" if Farage had been a Brexit negotiator.
May’s challenge to create unity in the deeply divided party is underscored by the fact that conservatives remain involved in a separate demonstration against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is struggling to keep his compromise plan on track under attacks from both Brexiteers, remainers and the EU.
Her allies insist that despite the setback, she will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels – forcing the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package or “chaos”.
At the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull, Bone announced that he would scrap the Chequers plan.
He explained that he should have included Farage and given him responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he had the responsibility, we would have been out by now,” he said.
The minister from Wellingborough added: “I will fight for Brexit, but we must scrap the Chequers.”
On the background of his EU opposition, he said: "We did not fight world wars to be anyone's subordinate.
We will decide our own laws in our own country.”
Bone rejected that the public's position should have changed since the 2016 vote: "That the British people should have changed their minds and would like to stay in the EU is completely wrong."
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also attended the demonstration and told reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The Chequers plan is unpopular in the general population, the opposition does not vote for it, it is unpopular in our own party and among our activists, who are actually on the street and getting us elected.
Now drop Chequers and start listening."
As a tip note to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises.”
Farage told the rally that politicians should be able to “feel the pressure” if they fail to make the decision from the 2016 vote.
“Now it’s a question of trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They will betray Brexit, but we are gathered to tell them that we are not letting them get away with it.”
In a message to the enthusiastic public, he added: “You have to make sure that the political class that is on the verge of betraying Brexit can feel the pressure.
“We are mobilising the people’s army here in the country that gave us the victory in Brexit, and we will not stop until we have become an independent, self-governing and proud Britain.”
Meanwhile, marchers remained through Birmingham before a two-hour march into the city centre.
Scattered activists waved Conservatives Against Brexit banners after the group’s proliferation this weekend.
Before the meeting, Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the security issues with the Conservative party app.
“These are the people who claim to be in control of Canada’s IT systems and technology, to border controls, to free trade without borders in Ireland,” he said.
"It's totally ridiculous.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren “considers strongly” running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren, a member of the House of Representatives, said she was "strongly considering running for president" after the midterm elections in November.
According to the Boston Globe, the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future during a town council meeting on Saturday in western Massachusetts.
Warren, who has often criticized Donald Trump, will seek re-election in November against state Republican candidate Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired Trump’s 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
It has been speculated that she would challenge Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday afternoon was her 36th meeting with voters in the city hall since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she planned to run for president.
Warren responded that it’s time for “women to go to Washington and fix our political system, and that requires a woman at the front.”
Arrest in case of shooting at LSU's Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested Friday for the shooting of Wayde Sims, the basketball player from LSU.
Baton Rouge police announced that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson had been arrested Friday for an ET news meeting at 11 a.m.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday to ask for help identifying a man on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot and killed near Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died from the injuries," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul said.
Wayde intervened to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to being present, possessing a weapon and shooting the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without issue and is now in police custody in the East Baton Rouge district.
Sims was a two-meter high third-year student who grew up in Baton Rouge. Last season he played 32 games, started in ten and played an average of 17.4 minutes and made 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russia's grand prix: Lewis Hamilton close to the World Cup, after team orders gives him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team’s orders would play a crucial role for the race.
From the driver's position, Bottas got a good start and was close to slowing Hamilton off completely when he defended his position in the first two corners and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel drove in the pit first, leaving Hamilton to battle traffic at the back of the field, which should have been crucial.
The Mercedes went into pit a while later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came back in front when the Ferrari driver after some wheel contact reluctantly had to leave the inner lane after a double defense at the third turn.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and was number seven after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for a large part of the race when, in an attempt at a quick finish, he failed to change tyres to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth place.
He had to go in the pit in the 44th inning, but could not increase the pace in the last eight innings, which is why Raikkonen secured the fourth place.
“It’s a tough day because Valtteri did amazing all weekend and was really a gentleman when he let me come by.
The team did an incredible job of securing both first and second place,” Hamilton said.
Really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at a voter rally on Saturday because she insisted she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
At a voter meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly refer to the testimony Ford had given before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, but said instead that events in the Senate showed that people were “wicked and disgusting and dishonest.”
“The one thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that’s happened the last few days in the Senate when you see the anger when you see people who are angry and vicious and disgusting and dishonest,” he said.
“When you look at statements and leaks, and then they say, ‘Oh, it wasn’t me.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember that?
Dianne Feinstein, did you leak it?
Remember her answer... Was it you who leaked the document – “uh, uh, what?
No, no, no.
I didn’t leak anything.”
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Have we leaked... No, we haven’t leaked anything,” he added in an imitation of the senator.
Feinstein sent the letter about Ford’s accusations against Kavanaugh back in July, and it was leaked earlier in September – but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
“I haven’t concealed Dr. Ford’s allegations, and I haven’t leaked her story,” Feinstein told the committee.
"She asked me to keep the letter confidential, and I did."
But her denial was not well received by the president, who said during Saturday's vote: "I tell you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
During the president’s continued defense of the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual assault by three women, Trump suggested that the Democrats used the allegations to benefit their own cause.
“They are withholding no funds in their efforts to take back power.
You can see the wickedness, the resentments, they don't care who they're drumming with to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars v Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars did well again after Friday's lost Elite League game against the Belfast Giants by winning the return game 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants came quickly ahead with two goals with attacks from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized at home before Dwyer again brought the Giants to the front.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win with two more goals.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's team, coming from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Friday's match in Belfast.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the sides, where the Giants went out as winners in the previous three games.
Dwyer finished in the fourth minute at 3:35 from an assist from Kendall McFaull with David Rutherford as an assist as Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a busy early period, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game at 13:10, before Matt Marquardt was behind Cownie's draw at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants got ahead at the first break when he made his second goal at the end of the first period.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard equalized again with a nice goal at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the team's fifth goal victory halfway through the final period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their five games, are at home in Milton Keynes for their next game on Friday.
Flight attendants died to ensure that hundreds of air passengers avoided earthquakes
A flight attendant in Indonesia was hailed as a hero after he died to ensure a plane carrying several hundred passengers landed safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake hit Sulawesi Island on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks are still ravaging the area, and many are trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
Although 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung's colleagues fled for their lives, he refused to leave his seat in the swinging control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his place to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway, safely entered the air.
He jumped out of the control tower because he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision could have saved hundreds of lives.
We got a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are broken,” he added.
Authorities fear that the death toll could reach several thousand, and the country's disaster preparedness reports that there is limited access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
"The death toll is expected to rise because there are still many bodies in the ruins, and it is not possible to reach them," spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said.
Up to six meters high waves have destroyed Palu, which holds a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are flying emergency aid and supplies in.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: “Every minute comes a new ambulance with more bodies.
There is a lack of clean water.
All the shops were looted.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is working hard to help the survivors, but we don’t know what we’re getting at.
It’s already a tragedy, but it can get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work around the clock to carry out all the tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?" he said, according to CNN.
Indonesia was hit by an earthquake in Lombrok earlier this year that killed more than 550 people.
Air Niugini says a man is missing after a plane crash in the lagoon
The airline behind the plane that crashed into the lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now says a man is missing, even though it had previously been reported that all 47 passengers and crew had been evacuated from the sinking plane.
According to a press release, Air Niugini said it could not locate a male passenger on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and police to try to find the man.
The airline has not returned requests for further information about the passenger, such as age and nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water during landing at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said Friday that seven people had been rushed to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained at the hospital until Saturday and that they were all in stable condition.
It is still not clear what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both say the plane landed in the lagoon in front of the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying past the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane landed on very low water.
"It was really lucky," Jaynes said.
Jaynes said he and other passengers could walk in the water to life to get to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He said the crew panicked and shouted, and that he had suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working to renovate a nearby quay also helped in the rescue work by using a rubber boat to carry people ashore before the plane sank to about 30 meters deep.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in accidents with PNG-registered airlines over the past two decades, but that Air Niugini has not been involved in these accidents.
Analyst Sets Timeline for the Night a Woman Was Burned Alive
The prosecution concluded its evidence on Saturday during the prosecution of a man accused of burning a woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert witness in the field of data analysis.
He described to the jury how he used teleinformation to piece together the course of the 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several different mobile phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, which was contrary to his earlier claims.
When the data showed that his cell phone was close to Chambers' cell phone at the time he had alleged that he was with his friend Michael Sanford, Sanford visited the police.
Sanford sat in the witness stand on Saturday and told me he was out of town that day.
When the prosecutor asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford’s truck that night, Sanford said he was “lying because my truck was in Nashville.”
Another disagreement was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
The mobile data showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life," Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its proceedings on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to vote later the same day.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by giving their music positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol believes that hip hop has moved away from its origins with political messages and social issues.
They will return to the starting point and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have recently had a revival in the UK due to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?
New York's nanny sues couple for firing 'racist' text messages
A nanny in New York City is suing a couple for discriminatory firing after being sent a text message by mistake from her mother, who complained that she was "another black person".
The couple denied they were racists, but compared the lawsuit to “abuse.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, who is a mother of two, expressed her dismay at finding out that the new nanny, Giselle Maurice, was black when she showed up on her first day of work in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEJ, NOT JUST A SOMEONE," Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending it to her husband, she came to send it to Giselle Maurice, even twice.
When she discovered her mistake, the "inconvenient" Plasco-Flaxman fired Giselle Maurice and said that their former nanny, who was from African-American, had been bad at her job and that she instead expected a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Giselle Maurice was paid for her one-day work and sent home in an Uber.
Now, Giselle Maurice is suing the couple to get compensation for the fire as well as compensation for $350 a day in the six months she was supposed to have lived with her family, even though this was agreed upon without a contract.
“I want to show them that you can’t allow yourself to do that,” she told the paper on Friday, adding, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple have defended themselves by saying that they are not racists and that the firing of Maurice was justified because they were afraid that they would not be able to trust her after insulting her.
"My wife had come to send her something she wouldn't have said.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” Plasco told The Post.
“But would you leave your children to someone you had been rude to, even if it had happened by mistake?
Your baby?
"Honestly."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to "suppression" and that his wife had given birth two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
“Are you really looking for someone like that?
It’s not very friendly,” added the investment advisor.
Although the trial is still ongoing, the People’s Court has already written off the couple on social media and shamed their behavior and logic.
New Letter Reveals Paddington Publishers Feared Readers Couldn't Relate to a Talking Bear
Bond’s daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was recorded for publication, said of the letter: “It’s hard to imagine being the first to read it before it was published.
It's pretty fun to read now that you know how popular Paddington became."
She said that her father, who worked as a cameraman on the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about a small clothing teddy bear, would have been optimistic, although his story was rejected, and that the 60th anniversary of the publication of the books was "bittersweet" after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important part of our family" and says that her father was modestly proud of her success.
“He was a quiet man, and he didn’t like to brag,” she said.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it almost felt like you had a child who achieved something: You’re proud of them, even though it’s not really your merit.
I don't think he saw Paddington's popularity that way.
Although it was his work and his imagination, he used to say it was Paddington's fault."
I said goodbye to my daughter on the phone.
After the landing, her daughter was taken to the Hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called on a regular basis to say that it was really bad and that she probably did not survive," Mrs Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad that she was going to die within the next few minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
So I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll see you soon.
I'll see you.
The medicine she had been given to keep her heart going slowly lost its effect.
She had died a short time before, and now her body was closing down.
I just had to sit there and wait for it to happen.
I could not scream or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to try to get together.”
Eventually, the grieving Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane along with the other passengers, who had no idea what she was going through.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
"I bowed my head, and the tears continued to run.
It’s hard to explain, but on the plane I had an overwhelming sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving Women Trying to Stop Suicide Shoppers
Two women who have lost relatives to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have put up cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers where you can get help.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he suffered from depression and 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want any parent to experience the grief I go through every day,” she said.
Sharon Davis, 45, said her son was a promising cook with an infected smile.
His smile was familiar to everyone.
People said his smile lit up the room."
However, he stopped working before he died because he was really ill.
In 2014, it was Tyler’s 11-year-old brother who found him when he had taken his own life.
Sharon Davis once said, “I’m always afraid of it spreading.”
Sharon Davis made the cards to “tell people that there’s someone out there that you can contact and talk to, even your friends.
Don’t go with your thoughts yourself – you have to talk to someone.”
Sharon Davis' longtime friend, Kelly Humphreys, lost her boyfriend of 15 years, Mark, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say anything about being sad or depressed or anything,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, he started to change.
He was really far down on Christmas Day. When the kids opened their presents, he had no eye contact with them at all."
She said that his death was very traumatic for them, but that they have to get through it: “It has created a hole in our family.
It has torn us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future is still unclear as FBI begins investigation
“I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for – a limited-time study with limited scope – maybe we could get a little consensus,” Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee “fell off the rails” in the midst of the stalemate.
Why would Kavanaugh and his Republican backers not have the FBI do their investigation?
Their restraint is due to the timing.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, on November 6, and if Republicans, as expected, do poorly, they will be weakened in their efforts to get the man they want elected to the country’s highest judicial office.
George W. Bush has called on senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and thereby met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary.
What happens when the FBI completes its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is still not known whether Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would give Vice President Mike Pence the crucial vote and elect him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean defectors 'falls' under Kim Jong-un
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawmaker.
Park Byeong-seug referred to data from South Korea’s Ministry of Mergers and said there were 1,127 defectors last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park mentioned that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher numbers due to human smugglers were contributing to the changed numbers.
Pyongyang has not made any official comments.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors will eventually be offered citizenship in South Korea.
The South Korean government says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most are fleeing via China, which has the longest border offensively up to North Korea, and which is easier to cross than the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea.
China regards the defectors as illegal immigrants and not refugees, so they are often forcibly returned.
Relations between North and South Korea – which is technically still at war – have improved significantly over the past few months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the beleaguered negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This comes after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korea on a global level.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no faith in our national security, and in such circumstances, it is excluded that we will disarm on our own,” Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s unfit for the Supreme Court
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated for Supreme Court Justice, “hysterical” and said his temperament was not fit for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi's comment came in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had behaved that way, she would have been called hysterical,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emphatically denied the allegations that he had committed a sexual assault against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional, and when he talked about his family and his years in high school, he almost screamed and was about to cry.
He also condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the accusations against him “grotesque and a coordinated courage of character” arranged by the left, angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the presidency in 2016.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's statement proved he could not sit in the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think he’s disqualified himself with the statements and the way he went after Clinton and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi walked away when she was asked if she would try to bring Kavanaugh for an impeachment if he is confirmed and if the Democrats get a majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’d say that if he doesn’t speak the truth to Congress or the FBI, he’s not fit to sit in the Supreme Court, but certainly rather in the court he’s sitting in now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently serving as a judge of the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat she was concerned about Kavanaugh’s possible decisions in connection with Obama’s health care reform or the abortion case Roe v. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
During the hearings, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would reverse certain previous Supreme Court rulings.
"It must not happen that a hysterical, presumptuous person should contest a job as a judge and expect us to say 'yes, it's not just great,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to use it.
It's a fair outcome, months and years of anger coming over, and she can't get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's abnormal, do you?"
She continued: “I got a lot of support from a woman who was the boss, who said that she also cried when she got angry, but that she developed a technique that meant that when she got angry and started crying, she would say to the one she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sorry because I’m crying.
But I'm angry."
And then she just kept going.
And I thought it was genius.”
Tears are allowed as an expression of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is from one of my first jobs in an office with a preponderance of men, where I often cried out in anger, where I was taken by the neck of an older woman – a cold boss that I had always been a little afraid of – and pulled out onto the stairs.
"You must never let them see you cry," she said to me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They’ll think you’re sorry, and they’ll accept that they got you.”
Patricia Schroeder, who was a member of the Colorado Democratic Congress at the time, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Hart was revealed to have an affair on a boat named Monkey Business and retired as a candidate, Schroeder was really frustrated and found that she could just as well run for president herself.
“It wasn’t a very thoughtful decision,” she told me laughing 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates in the race, and they certainly didn’t need another candidate.
Some called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs."
Because it was late in the campaign, she was lagging behind with fundraising, so she promised she wouldn’t participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was lost in advance.
She discovered that some of her supporters, who gave $1,000 to men, only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she thought.
When she gave a speech that she didn’t want to stand up, she was overwhelmed by emotions – gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration over the system that made it so difficult to raise money and reach out to voters instead of voters, and anger over sexism – that she got a lump in her throat.
“You would think I had a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls how the press reacted to her.
"You would think I was sponsored by Kleenex.
I remember thinking, what are you going to write on my gravestone?
"She was crying"?
How the U.S.-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The opening salvos of the U.S.-China trade war were loud, and although the battle is far from over, divisions between the countries may be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
U.S. President Donald Trump fired the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing tariffs on key Chinese exports, such as solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods applies in principle to half of all goods imported into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has retaliated each time, most recently by imposing tariffs of 5-10% on US goods for $60 billion.
China has sworn to follow the United States all the way, and the world’s second-largest economy probably won’t give up just yet.
If it makes Washington withdraw its demands, it means they give in, but for China’s president, Xi Jinping, it would be too embarrassing to bow to the United States.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the US pressure in the trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run by making the two markets less dependent on each other.
“A quick decision in either Washington or Beijing can create the breeding ground for an economy that can get out of control in both countries, and it’s actually a lot more dangerous than you thought,” said Abigail Grace, a research fellow with a focus on Asia at the think tank Center for New American Security.
Syria 'ready' to take in refugees, foreign minister says
Syria says it is ready for the return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by the more than seven-year war.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
“Today, the situation is more stable and secure thanks to the successful fight against terrorism,” he said.
The government remains in control of the areas destroyed by terrorists and is working to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now present for the refugees to return to the country they had to leave because of terrorists and the unilateral economic sanctions that hit their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still in the country are in need of emergency aid.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian government would like to receive help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that the government would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that helped support the uprising.
Europe secures Ryder Cup victory in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated the U.S. team 16.5-10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on European soil and has not won a single Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won the trophy back when Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn's team reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled for most of the tournament, shot his drive into the lake at par 3 on the 16th hole, causing him to lose the match against Francesco Molinari.
Italian Molinari managed well in all rounds and became 1 out of a total of 4 players who have received 5-0-0 since 1979, when the current format of the tournament started.
American Jordan Spieth was sent out with 5&4 by the lowest ranked European player, Danish Thorbj<0xC3><0xB8>rn Olesen.
No. 1 in the world rankings, Dustin Johnson, fell 2 and 1 to Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The veteran with eight Ryder Cups in his luggage, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, became the tournament's most winning European with 25.5 career points.
“I usually don’t cry, but today I can’t do it.
It's been a rough year.
I am very grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I’m really happy to have the trophy back.
It’s a team effort, and I’m glad I could help,” Garcia said after the European victory.
He passes the torch on to his compatriot John Ram, who toppled American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a single match on Sunday.
"I am incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods. I followed him as a child," said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup history of 13-21-3.
It’s a flurry of statistics for one of the best golfers ever to have won 14 major titles, surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find form except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had a solid game throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance: "I'm proud of the boys because they fought for the cause.
There was still time this morning when we gave Europe a backlash.
We lost.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's an excellent captain.
All his 12 players played really well.
We will regroup, and I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we will move forward.
I love the 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to lighten your hat.
We were defeated.”
Algae bloom update: Concentrations reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
