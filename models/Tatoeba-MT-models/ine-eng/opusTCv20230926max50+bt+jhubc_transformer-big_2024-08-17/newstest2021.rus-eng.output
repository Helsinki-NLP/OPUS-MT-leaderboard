Two Mexican states have declared a state of emergency over Hurricane Hanna.

The hurricane will bring heavy rains to Mexico, in some areas it is predicted to fall from 150 to 250 liters of rainfall per square meter.
The authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
10,000 people will be helped, including rescuers, soldiers of the National Guard and the military.

Semilarsky against the prosecutor's office: the cassation of the former Deputy Mayor Tartu will be considered on August 4
This means that a decision on it will most likely be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances to consider Semilarski's claim refused, but in April his cassation complaint was accepted in the proceedings by the State Court.
On 12 December 2019, the Tartu Administrative Court returned the complaint to the applicant, as its decision does not fall within his jurisdiction of the administrative court.
The court decision stated that the complaint contained a claim for compensation for the damage caused during the criminal proceedings.
"Such issues should be regulated by the prosecutor's office and the district court," Tartu court press secretary Anett Kr<0xC3><0xA4>tsmann told an ERR correspondent.
According to her, Valvo Semilarski appealed this decision to the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the judge will have to say his word.
According to defender Semilarski, jury lawyer Oliver Nyaes, his client for about two years was unreasonably suspected of bribery.
He now demands that the prosecutor's office refute the false allegations against him and compensate him for the moral damage.
The reason for submitting the complaint to the court was the statements of the special prosecutor for the special cases of the Lyuna District Prosecutor’s Office Margus Gross, made by him in October 2017, when Semilarski, together with another deputy mayor Tartu Artem Suvorov at that time, was arrested on suspicion of committing a crime.
“When I was detained, the Security Police and the Prosecutor’s Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most influential bodies of local self-government, were selling.
These air-suspended public suspicions accompanied me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions turned out to be false, the prosecutor’s office does not want to say anything about it,” Semilarski said in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nees, at a press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecutor’s office should operate.
“The claim of bribery and selling was false, but that’s not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia, as well as on Lithuania, that during the investigation phase, state representatives must be careful when choosing words so that suspects are not represented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor’s office is also bound by the presumption of innocence, which, unfortunately, was not observed in this case against Valvo Semilarski,” he said.
"Semilarski's public appearance as a serious offender and briber in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being determined are inadmissible, which contradicts the presumption of innocence and is unfair to the applicant," the court said.
As rus.err.ee wrote, former Deputy Mayor Tartu Valvo Semilarski will not be held responsible for the charge of bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is tried on charges of deliberate violation of anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions in particularly large sizes.
According to the indictment, in the period from 2015 to 2017, the former Deputy Mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in the meetings of the city administration in making decisions related to the companies operating in Tartu, with the owners or managers of which Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level outside work.
According to Gross, in all these cases Semilarsky had personal interests, and therefore he had to refrain from participating in decision-making.
Earlier, as wrote rus.err.ee, the prosecutor's office has presented Semilarski suspicions of receiving bribes and violation of anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions in particularly large sizes.
This happened in October 2016, when he was detained along with another deputy mayor Artem Suvorov (Center Party).
Then the prosecutor’s office and the security police said that there was strong evidence against both vice mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
Suvorov’s case later came to court, which fully justified the policy.
The trial of Valvo Semilarski is still ongoing.

How will the decision of the Central Bank to reduce the key rate affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to reduce the key rate again.
It fell by another 0.25 percentage point, to 4.25% per annum - the formal next historical minimum.
Judging by the return of the short step of lowering the rate, as well as the tonality of the statements of the Central Bank and updated forecasts on the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic prospects more optimistically than before.
This means that the current cycle of monetary policy easing may soon come to a halt.
“We have continued to soften monetary policy, first of all, given that the risks of deviation of inflation are still down from 4% in 2021,” Bank of Russia head Elvira Nabiullina said.
They are associated with a significant decrease in economic activity, a drop in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, according to Nabiullina, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the lifting of the restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes have come to life: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand have been restored, construction and production of consumer goods have been expanded, annual rates of reduction in transport and industrial production have been slowed down.
According to the updated forecast of the Central Bank, in 2020 the reduction of the economy will be 4.5-5.5% (previously expected to be 4-6%), and the restorative growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3.5-4.5%, in 2022 - 2.5-3.5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised the forecast for annual oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
Earlier, the Central Bank had expected $27 and $35 per barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia’s inflation forecast for 2020 was 3.7-4.2% against the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia’s view of the situation in the economy is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the cycle of easing, according to economists on Russia and CIS “Renaissance Capital” Sofia Donetsk and Andrei Melashchenko.
Thus, the Bank of Russia consistently lowers the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has already fallen by 3.5 percentage points.
And at the last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it by one percentage point due to low inflation rates due to suppressed demand and the need to stimulate a slowing economy due to the pandemic and related restrictions.
The chances of adjusting monetary policy remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, agrees the chief analyst of Rosbank Yevgeny Koshelev.
The pool of pro-inflationary risks also points to the nearness of a pause in softening interest policy – disrupted supply chains, a possible increase in costs due to epidemic prevention measures and faster (compared to expectations) recovery of demand, he says.
In conclusion, the Bank of Russia’s subsequent actions will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased against the background of geopolitical conflicts, Koshelev points out.
Either way, a reduction in the key rate will lead to a further reduction in rates for the most reliable borrowers, as well as, perhaps, on the mortgage, says senior economist of the analytical management of the bank "Open" Maxim Petronevic.
The rate correction will be less pronounced than the key rate reduction, he said.
Interest rates on consumer loans may fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, mortgage rates may end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, does not exclude the economist "BKS Premier" Anton Pokatovich.
Average interest rates on deposits, in his opinion, will also fall - in the coming months they may fall to 4.2-4.5% (now just above 4.5%).
Further, they can fall to 4% if the central bank lowers the key rate in the autumn, according to Pokatovich.
The centrist party promises to pay all its debts by the end of the year

The Union of Peasants and Greens of Lithuania, which heads the ruling Sejm coalition, has topped the party rankings.
This was shown by a survey conducted by the sociological research company Vilmorus por commissioned by the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.

Excess requirements for public procurement applications are excluded by law
The legislation may establish exhaustive requirements for applications for participation in procurement.
In the autumn session of the plenary session, the State Dumas plan to consider in the second reading a bill establishing the requirements for the content and composition of the application for participation in the procurement, which can be attended only by small and medium-sized businesses.
Amendments are made by the government to the law "On purchases of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities".
The draft law was developed in compliance with the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the Development of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.
It provides for the preparation of a draft law on a comprehensive list of documents that customers have the right to request in the form of an application from procurement participants - small and medium-sized enterprises.
And also the list of requirements for these documents.
To date, the law "On procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities" regulates the procurement activities of certain types of legal entities.
The requirements for the content, form, design and composition of the application for participation in the procurement shall be established by the customers independently in the procurement documentation.
"As a result, the customers establish excessive requirements for the content, registration of the application, the mandatory presence in its composition of certificates, certificates, statements, the period of receipt of which in the authorized bodies is comparable with the period of submission of applications, which leads to the impossibility of participation in such purchase and reduction in the purchase price," the law reads.
The new bill provides for the establishment of a comprehensive list of documents that customers have the right to request in the form of an application from the participants of the purchase, who are subjects of small and medium-sized enterprises.
"The adoption of the document will eliminate the arbitrary establishment by customers of requirements for the composition and content of applications of participants who are subjects of small and medium-sized enterprises," the explanatory note says.

International affairs experts Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky called Mike Pompeo the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States.
The material with their opinion on July 23 was published by CNN.

Head of the region Igor Kobzev met with the mayors of Ust-Ordyn Buryat district
During the workshop held today, 24 July, the Government of the Irkutsk Region discussed the main directions of the development of remote agrarian territories.
During his working trips to the districts of Ust-Ordyn Buryat district, the head of the region gave a number of instructions.
Today the mayors reported on their performance.
First of all, the construction of the Sports House in Ust-Ord was resumed.
The order for this object was given by the President of the Russian Federation fourteen years ago.
But only now the situation has been able to move from a dead point.
866 million rubles will be spent on construction.
Deadline for construction in 2022.
And already this year, the school in Bayandai village should be put into operation.
At the moment, the decoration of the premises is completed.
Of the remaining works - improvement of the territory.
In general, the program of construction of preschool and secondary education facilities is of special importance for the region.
For your district in particular.
The demographic situation here is the best in the region.
And we are obliged to create all the conditions for the education and leisure of children of all ages,” said Igor Kobzev, Governor of the Irkutsk Region.
At the meeting, the head of the region instructed all mayors to actively participate in the work on the development of general plans of settlements.
This is one of the main conditions for the integrated development of the district.
All settlements must have established boundaries and a master plan.
This is necessary for the development of the territory, for the construction of socially significant objects, as well as infrastructure and cultural heritage objects, the head of the region stressed.
Also during the conversation, a problematic issue was raised with a 30% reduction in milk intake for cooperatives.
This was due to the redistribution by the processing company of the purchase of milk in favor of peasant farms.
As a result, the share of co-operatives’ production intake has decreased.
The head of the region instructed the acting Minister of Agriculture to go to the place, study the structure of milk sales, analyze the experience of other territories and determine options for solving the problem.

Moscow authorities told about the fate of the closed landfills
In the Moscow region, landfills of solid household waste continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities have promised to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 existing landfills are being modernized into modern must-processing complexes.
But this option is not possible for every landfill - many of them have grown into a dense residential development.
After the landfill is closed, it gets up for recultivation - the body of the landfill is sprinkled with soil, the degassing and draining systems are installed.
This makes it possible to stop the chemical processes inside the landfill, so that it does not ignite, does not effluent, does not poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the former dump remains to be raised by a useless pile among the surrounding housing.
Why not make it something useful?
For example, in Ruse, where the recultivation of the Annino site was literally completed the other day, the authorities are considering the option of making a pile of ski slopes.
This landfill, which operated from 1976 to 2016, has grown so much that it has gone beyond the boundaries of the land allocated to it.
Therefore, during recultivation, it was necessary to buy out the neighboring areas, which have been de facto littered for a long time.
“Some time will pass, the field will ‘sit down’, fortresses will be built, and we will think what can be done so that it begins to benefit.
Right in the eyes - a ski resort ", - told journalists the head of the Ruz district Nikolay Parfenov.
Two landfills will become sites for the production of renewable energy sources
Polygons "Torbeevo" in Lyubertsy and "Timokhovo" in the Bogorod district will become sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
At the end of the year, a gas-fired power plant will be launched on the territory of Torbeev, capable of producing up to 8 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year and about 0.95 gigacalories of thermal energy, which will provide its own needs of the landfill - heat supply to administrative and production premises.
Timohovo will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and will continue to operate as a must-repair complex.
And on the Balashikhinsk landfill "Kuchino", which was closed after complaints of residents on the "Direct line" with the president of the country, may be created a museum.
"There was such an idea - to create a museum of recultivation of polygons of the Moscow region," - said the Deputy Prime Minister - Minister of ecology and nature management of the region Dmitry Kurakin.

The governor's vrio explained that he had not gone to the protesters before, because he could not communicate with thousands of demonstrators.

Beautiful high minarets only decorated Aya-Sofia
Again about Aya-Sofia - the text of Fr. Vladimir Zelinsky, which, I think, should be protested.
First of all, there was a free entrance - hurrah!
I was not in Istanbul, but the entrance to the House of God is free rather than paid.
Secondly, Muslims have just as honestly conquered this land as the Orthodox have conquered the Volgo-Oksk intercalary, Muslim Caucasus (and have put the church in Grozny) and planted apples on Mars.
God help!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans have conquered America.
Are we going to give it all back?
Do you think there will be no pagans who will demand the return of their capitol, in the place of which the Decimal Church?
Thirdly, the Muslims improved this building, invested in it.
That is, it belongs to them as well as the factories and estates that the Leninists have taken from the bourgeois in their property, belong to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenclature.
They've improved everything from the Kremlin to Ankara, so it's all their right of progressors.
Beautiful high minarets very decorated Aya-Sofia, very.
She was a stupid ink girl, she became a stupid ink girl with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no “Islamic” and “Orthodox” civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hanjas that unite faith and hypocrisy.
A believer in the categories of civilization does not think.
This is the thinking of an official of the British Foreign Office Toynbee, who believes it is shameful to think so.
A place of prayer for those who believe.
And always.
The believer does not pray only where he is asked to go – he goes to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a defender.
We're bells, not thunder-stones.

Kobe had the killer’s instinct, so on the pitch I tried to talk him out of taking the game aggressively.
On the stage I complimented him: "Oh!
Kobe, good score, great pass!
Listening to my enthusiastic responses, he kind of forgot that you have to take the ball in your hands and score another 3-4 points.
We had a good conversation with Kobe," Kirillenko said, referring to "Evening Moscow."
He also spoke about his first game against Jordan.
"I have cared for him.
For the first three minutes of the match, I ran in total admiration for the fact that next to me was a legend that I had only seen on television.
As long as I'm happy in my breath, Michael scored a lot of points.
Soon I turned away from the delights, covered his throws a couple of times...
In that game, my team won, and Jordan still scored 44 points," the head of the Russian Federation added.
Kirilenko spent 12 seasons in the NBA.
He was selected by Utah Jazz in the 1999 draft as the 24th overall.
In addition to Yuta, for which he spent ten seasons, the Russian forward played for the Minnesota Timberwolves and the Brooklyn Nets.
In a total of 797 matches, in which he averaged 11.8 points, he made 5.5 selections, 2.7 assists and 1.8 block shots.
Earlier it was reported that Kirillenko will nominate his candidacy for the election of the head of the Russian Federation.
Degtyarev surprised by information about the purchase of Sakhalin-1 gas for dollars
On Sunday, July 26, Mikhail Degtyarev, acting governor of Khabarovsk Territory, during a meeting with residents of Soviet Havana, was surprised that the region is buying Sakhalin gas produced by the American company Exxon Neftegas for dollars.
U.S. gas is contracted in dollars until 2025.
To be honest, I didn’t know that, and I’m in such a downpour because of that information.
I had no idea what would happen in Russia in 2020,” he told RIA Novosti.
Degtyarev noted that this issue was discussed with the head of the Russian Ministry of Energy Alexander Novak during his visit to Khabarovsk on July 24.
The governor also stressed that by 2025, “Gazprom” will switch to the supply of Russian power plants and capacities, which means that Russian gas purchased in rubles will be used “at normal prices”.
The Sakhalin-1 project is implemented through a product-sharing agreement, where Exxon Neftegas Ltd is the project operator with a 30% stake, another 20% at Rosneft, Sodeco Japan with 30% and ONGC India with 20%.
The Khabarovsk Territory has been acquiring gas from this project since 2005.

The actor of the Russian series responded to the accusations of "propaganda of LGBT and feminism"
The actor of the Russian series “Chicago”, whose creators were accused of “promoting LGBT and feminism”, responded to the claims to the film.
The authors “understood the sharpness of the raised themes and did not want to offend anyone,” said the American Steven Thomas Oxner in an interview with the publication “The Rise.”
“I think it’s a story about power and the general aspects of human life.
This has nothing to do with LGBT and feminism,” said the actor who played the father of the boy who changed into a woman’s outfit.
He said he was “proud of the job” and did not consider it propaganda.
At the same time, the American added, he is frightened by the reaction of some people to the plot line of the series: for example, there was a case when "a man in a deep breath shot the set and said that all this is not true."
“Then there were a couple of cases where we met disgruntled locals who didn’t understand what we were doing.
But we were open, so the people who first came with the claims began to help us,” he summed up.
The case of the shooting, the publication explains, occurred in September 2019 in Kabardino-Balkaria: a drunk man attacked the car of the shooting group with a gun, after which he was detained by police officers.
Earlier it was reported that the public representative for the protection of the family Olga Baranets sent a complaint to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Roskomnadzor on the service more.tv, which hosted the Russian series "Chiki".
Baranets accused the creators of the series of "propaganda of unconventional sexual relations and feminism", noting that the main characters of the film work as prostitutes, and the series itself contains "scenes of physical and psychological violence".
The ombudsman was also outraged by the fact that "the series pays a lot of attention to the homosexual sexual orientation" of the minor character.
The comedy drama "Chicago" tells about three prostitutes who started a new life and opened a business on the advice of a friend.
