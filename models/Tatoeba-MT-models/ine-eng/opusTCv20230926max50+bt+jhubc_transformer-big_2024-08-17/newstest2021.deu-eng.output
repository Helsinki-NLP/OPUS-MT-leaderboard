Biker reacts quickly and prevents worse
On Friday evening, a traffic accident occurred on the country road between Machtolsheim and Merklingen, in which a motorcyclist was only slightly injured due to his quick reaction.
The driver ignores the biker.
A 44-year-old driver wanted to turn left towards Machtolsheim on Landesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 1230 with her VW from Merklingen around 9.30 pm.
In doing so, she oversaw the 24-year-old motorcyclist who came from the direction of Nellingen.
In the collision, hand and foot brake levers fly away
The biker still tried to avoid the car, but still tracked it at the rear of the vehicle.
Due to the stripping process, the hand and foot brake levers were torn off at the Suzuki and the driver was no longer able to brake.
In spirit, he drove his motorcycle in the green lanes next to the road and rolled it out there without falling.
Biker suffers leg injury
Due to the collision with the car, the biker still suffered an injury to the Beim and had to be treated in a clinic.
Mamming: Corona mass infection: 174 crop helpers infected
After a corona mass infection on a large vegetable farm in Mamming, Lower Bavaria, almost 500 people are under quarantine and are no longer allowed to leave the operation.
A security service is monitoring the curfew.
A total of 174 crop assistants were tested positive for the corona pathogen Sars-CoV-2 during the series examination, as reported by the Dingolfing-Landau County Council Office on Saturday evening.
"To avoid further spread, we unfortunately have to take this step to protect the population," said Landrat Werner Bumeder (CSU).
Previously, seven employees had already been infected in the operation - this was the occasion of the series test.
The farm is a large vegetable farm, which grows strawberries, cucumbers, cabbage and red beets - but the cucumbers are only for jars.
Mamming is a rural municipality with about 3,300 inhabitants near Dingolfing with its large BMW plant.
Bumeder appealed to the citizens to remain calm: "According to our information, this is a closed circle of people".
In the yard, infected were separated from non-infected employees, the site is now surrounded by a fence.
Greens and the SPD gave the state government co-responsibility.
The two opposition factions accused Prime Minister Markus S<0xC3><0xB6>der (CSU) and his cabinet of neglecting control of the housing of seasonal workers.
“This can be bitter if such local infection events are to take place and regional lockdowns have to be arranged,” said J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Mistol, the Greens’ parliamentary managing director.
The SPD looks very similar: "After the corona outbreak in the Wiesenhof-Schlachthof in mid-May, we have already called for a special control program also for farms with crop helpers," said environmental expert Florian von Brunn.
"Especially the hygiene conditions at the workplace and the housing conditions must be strictly controlled from our point of view.
That obviously didn’t happen.”
The outbreak came "with an announcement".
Aidenbachstra<0xC3><0x9F>e subway station: Dangerous dispute: 19-year-old falls into the track bed after Schubser
In a dispute between two youth groups at the Aidenbachstra<0xC3><0x9F>e subway station, a 19-year-old fell through a pusher and slipped into the track bed.
Obersendling - On Friday at the Aidenbachstra<0xC3><0x9F>e underground station around 16.15 a.m., a dispute arose between two youth groups.
A passerby alerted the police, who arrived with several stripes.
According to initial investigations, a Munich man (17) pushed a 19-year-old to the ground.
The young man slipped over the edge of the platform and fell into the track bed.
People from the group of the 17-year-old helped the downed climb out of the track.
There was no danger from an incoming train.
According to the police, there were clashes between the two men.
The 17-year-old initially fled the crime scene, but his personalities could be determined later.
Accompanied by his father, he went to the police station 29.
The 17-year-old has been charged with physical injury.
Report: Seehofer urges longer data storage
The data storage is currently suspended.
Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer, however, calls for an extension of the storage period, according to a media report.
He wants to strengthen the fight against child abuse.
Federal Minister of the Interior Horst Seehofer (CSU) calls for an extended storage of data - instead of the planned ten weeks for half a year, according to a media report.
As the “Picture on Sunday” reports, Seehofer Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht (SPD) asked in a letter for a quick change of law.
Seehofer therefore wants to strengthen measures against child abuse.
He believes it makes sense to “make urgently needed adjustments to the law already now,” the newspaper quoted the letter as saying.
The data storage is currently suspended.
A decision of the European Court of Justice is expected.
However, Seehofer wants the amendments to be applied immediately after a possible positive judgment, the report continues.
A spokesman for the Justice Department told the newspaper that it would only make sense to check whether there was a need for legal adjustments if the courts had made a decision.
In the fight against child abuse and child pornography, Seehofer, together with the interior ministers of the countries, had already called for a storage of data in June.
NBA: Clippers star Lou Williams' strip club boss
Excitement in the NBA!
Lou Williams, 33, basketball pro of the Los Angeles Clippers, is said to have left the tournament district at Disney World in Orlando/Florida with permission for a funeral.
According to US media reports, he visited the strip club "Magic City" in Atlanta in the evening.
Williams, who is reported to have admitted the visit according to ESPN data, is back in Isloation, is tested daily for Covid-19.
His reason for visiting: Chicken Wings.
In February of last year, "Sweet Lou", as he is called in the NBA, has already expressed his love for exactly these wings.
The American wrote, "Magic City and Blue Flame (another strip club in Atlanta, N.D.) have the best wings in the city."
NBA insider Shams Charania announced on Twitter on Sunday that the NBA Williams has ordered a ten-day quarantine.
Thus, the Clippers star misses the first two official games after the test game phase.
In Disney World, the NBA wants to end the Corona season.
Currently, the top 22 teams with training games are preparing for the season finale, which starts on Friday night.
S<0xC3><0xB6>der comments on the corona situation after mass infestation
Munich - Health Minister Melanie Huml (CSU) has already announced a test substance for large farms on Sunday.
The press conference will be live on our homepage.
The case in Mamming in the Dingolfing-Landau district has alarmed authorities and politicians.
Almost 500 crop helpers from several countries are currently working on the large vegetable farm, more than a third of them have been infected with the corona pathogen.
The farm is now under quarantine and is closed with a construction fence.
No one is allowed to leave the premises, food is delivered.
The authorities now offer free corona tests to the 3,300 inhabitants of the municipality.
Since the crop workers had little contact with the local population, the Landratsamt assumes that the infections have not spread beyond the farm.
"Wisdom bite": confession of the alleged firefighter of Nantes
“My client has been cooperative,” lawyer Quentin Chabert told the newspaper.
The defender added: "He regrets the actions very much, the confession was a liberation for him".
His mandate was “plagued by the bites of conscience and greatly taken away by the scale of the destruction.”
In the event of a conviction, the man faces ten years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The Gothic St. Peter and Paul Cathedral in Nantes had been badly damaged in a fire on the night of Saturday last week.
The fire broke out in three places far away from each other in the church.
Laboratory investigations hardened the suspicion of arson.
The suspect, who has now been detained, was arrested just hours after the fire.
He was released after a day.
The man works as a volunteer for the diocese of Nantes and was responsible for the closure of the cathedral on the eve of the fire.
As there was no sign of a violent intrusion into the church, he quickly caught the eye of the investigators.
Abolition of the 50+1 Rule
The former DFB president Reinhard Grindel has recommended to think about the abolition of the 50+1 rule.
“German football should at least discuss setting conditions and clear rules for investors before the EU Commission creates completed facts,” Grindel told Bild am Sonntag.
He stressed: "For the clubs that are most likely to be dangerous to Bayern and Dortmund, the 50+1 rules do not work anyway: see Leipzig or Leverkusen.
In this respect, one cannot get around the debate about whether it is not necessary to break into these phalanx associations, to facilitate the involvement of investors".
However, he has doubts whether there is the willingness in the German Football League to allow majority stakes, which are prohibited in the Bundesliga by the 50+1 rule.
"It remains a legal risk to pull investment fences in a European single market around the business location of the Bundesliga," Grindel said.
The former DFB boss sees the danger that "the attempts to ensure more competitive balance in the Bundesliga will only weaken the competitiveness of our top clubs at European level in the end, but will not lead to more tension in the championship".
Even an equal distribution of TV money will not have a decisive effect.
"FC Bayern makes a turnover of 750 million euros, Borussia Dortmund of 500 million euros and RB Leipzig of 300 million euros.
So the differences are already huge among the first three associations alone.
The other 15 clubs have an average budget of 130 million," the 58-year-old said.
Looking back on the past, Grindel feels betrayed.
“Unfortunately, there have been people who have noticed this mistake and made it through to the press instead of addressing me,” Grindel said of the adoption of an expensive watch that had led to his resignation in April 2019.
“It’s been very busy for me humanly.”
The gift, worth around 11,000 euros, he had received from a Ukrainian official.
“I committed a compliance violation, and it was right to draw the consequences from it,” Grindel said.
"With the ominous watch gift, I was completely transparent and unassuming.
A lot of people in the DFB knew about it.”
He never “made a hole out of the gift,” the 58-year-old assured.
“That may be naive, but anyway, this form of transparency was the complete opposite of corruption.”
"Black Lives Matter": Injured and one dead
Protests against police violence in the United States have escalated again due to Donald Trump’s deployment of federal police officers in several cities.
On Saturday, clashes broke out in several cities between protesters and police.
Three people were injured in Louisville, while 16 people were arrested in Seattle.
In Austin, one person was killed by gunshots while a demonstration train was just crossing a junction.
It had previously clashed again in Portland during protests against racism and police violence.
The security forces, including federal police officers, used tear gas on Saturday night and forcibly dispersed demonstrators.
Hundreds of demonstrators, some armed, marched through Louisville, Kentucky on Saturday, demanding that those responsible for Breonna Taylor’s death be held to account.
The 26-year-old student was shot dead in a drug raid in her Louisville apartment in March.
The target of the raid was someone else who did not live there, and no drugs were found.
When a member of a group calling itself an armed alliance of black Americans fired a shot on Saturday, three people were injured.
According to NBC, they were taken to the hospital.
None of them were in danger of death.
The police set up barricades because counter-demonstrators of a white militia had also formed.
In the end, there was no meeting between the two groups.
In Austin, Texas, one person was shot and killed in a “Black Lives Matter” demonstration.
According to police, a suspect was taken into custody.
She has not provided any details on the circumstances of the incident so far.
Mayor Steve Adler, according to the New York Times, said he was, like many in the city, “disgusting and callous” about what had happened.
Protesters also clashed with police in the American metropolis of Seattle on Saturday.
They set fire to construction cars in front of a youth prison, the police used blend grenades and pepper spray.
According to the Seattle Times, 16 people have been arrested for resisting police officers or injuring their bodies.
In Oakland, California, a courthouse was set on fire.
A small group of protesters smashed windows, shot down fireworks, and blinded police officers with lasers, Oakland police said late Saturday night.
The fire was quickly extinguished.
In Aurora, a suburb of Denver, Colorado, a car drove through a crowd demonstrating on a highway.
According to police, one of the protesters fired a gun and at least one person was injured and taken to the hospital.
In addition, windows were also smashed in a court and a fire was set, as the police reported.
Investigations have been initiated.
Rakoczy in Bad Kissingen: Historical costumes defy Corona
Although the big sauce was missing in the spa town, visitors and performers enjoyed the Rakoczy-Flair of the alternative program.
It was unusual for visitors, performers and organizers: The Rakoczy Weekend without Rakoczy Festival.
But: Even if the big party mile was missing in the city center, the crowds and program highlights such as Saale, Rakoczy-Ball or Festzug, many came at their expense during the Corona-compliant alternative program.
"I think we've managed to spread Rakoczy-Flair," says Sylvie Thormann, the spa's director.
The guests would have accepted it well.
In principle, one goes back to the beginnings of the Rakoczy festival, and only the historical ones were the focus of the festival.
A pleasant atmosphere.
For more than 25 years, Vesna Konh<0xC3><0xA4>user and her husband have always visited the Rakoczy festival Bad Kissingen.
This time in the corona year.
The couple has made themselves comfortable at the Luitpold casino, observes the historians while strolling and listens to the Cuban live music at the casino restaurant.
“I also find it very pleasant,” says Konh<0xC3><0xA4>user.
She does not miss the masses of people who otherwise belong to Rakoczy.
For this, however, you lack the usual program highlights, especially Saale burns on Friday evening as well as the historic parade and the closing fireworks on Sunday evening.
"That's too bad.
The weather would have been great this year,” she says.
Rakoczy equestrian tournament to be held again
For the performers of the historic spa guests, the alternative program meant in part more work.
For example, Christina Gold, who participates in a normal year at the festival and can be seen there on the coach of the spa garden cafe.
This year she was walking in the city on Saturdays and Sundays in costume.
"It's already exhausting, otherwise we'll have it easier," she says.
The equestrian club had less to do, even if individual equestrians were on the way in the park.
"We very much hope that the equestrian quadrille can take place again next year," says Chairman Ulrike Waldhofen.
She announced that after several years of break in 2021, a Rakoczy riding tournament will be held again.
28 Corona cases in Spanish runner-up Fuenlabrada
Spanish footballer CF Fuenlabrada is sliding deeper and deeper into the crisis due to a corona outbreak.
Since the newcomer from near Madrid had flown to the city of A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a on July 20, despite the first Corona cases, a low blow follows the next.
By Sunday, 28 players or team members had been tested positive, with one coming to the hospital, the club said.
Fuenlabrada from the city of the same name south-west of Madrid has so far had the chance to reach the ascent playoffs.
Now even the decline in the B-group of the Second League is threatening.
The match against Deportivo La Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a last Monday was canceled at the last minute, the prosecutor's office is investigating a possible crime against public health, the top sports authority CSD is considering the forced departure of the club.
The players and other team members sit in a hotel in quarantine.
"Until the sixth day of the quarantine, they did not receive a fresh towel and no gel," the sports newspaper AS wrote.
You can see on the photos how players would have hung underwear and club clothes in their rooms in the hotel for drying after apparently having to wash them themselves.
Also, the bed linen was not changed for five days.
Another problem is the food.
It is neither good nor sufficient, wrote "AS".
The club management, on the other hand, said they were satisfied with the hotel.
The club’s lawyer, Javier Tebas Llanas, rejected the charge of deliberately endangering public health.
There was no violation of the Corona rules set by the football association, the son of the president of the Spanish Primera Division, Javier Tebas, stressed, as reported by the news agency Europa Press and the sports newspaper "Marca".
Prior to departure, there were four infected people, all of whom had been isolated and had not travelled with them until July 19.
Just before the flight to A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a on Monday, all players and team members had been tested again.
When the team was already in A Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a, then "five or six" other team members of the Corona test had been positive.
The match was called off 60 minutes before the whistle, Tebas Llanas said.
Police need to catch horses in a dumpster
Two animals were on the road.
The police took her back to her owner.
On Sunday morning, just before 6 a.m., a road user shared two free-running horses on the feeder between the Donnersdorf/Steinsfeld junction and the Theres motorway junction.
When the officials arrived, the horses were already between the feeder and the village of Dampfach.
After the officials were able to win the trust of the horses just in front of the steam compartment, they each had a rope carried in the strip cart.
Tony Martin: Career Continuation Imaginable
Timing specialist Tony Martin is thinking about a continuation of his career.
Frankfurt/Main - Seven-time time trial world champion Tony Martin can certainly imagine continuing his cycling career.
"I'm just laying down the framework with the team, how and in what form it could proceed," the 35-year-old told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung.
Martin is currently employed by Dutch team Jumbo-Visma and had been considering ending his career after this year before the Corona break.
The negotiations with his team are also about the number of race days, he said.
Or for other problems that would plague him as a family father, Martin said.
Earlier he had risen after a fall, and the first thought had been: "Quickly back on the wheel.
Today, as the father of a little daughter, I think: What if".
The cycling pro admitted that there are certainly aspects with which he is increasingly difficult to deal with.
"But it did me good to remember from the Corona time what I have on cycling and how much fun it makes me."
At the Tour de l'Ain (5 to 9 August), the time trial specialist will once again enter the competition.
Bavaria: At least four dead on Bavaria’s streets over the weekend
The beautiful weather attracts bikers to the streets in many places.
For at least three people, the tour ends fatally with a motorcycle.
An 18-year-old pedestrian also died.
Sch<0xC3><0xB6>nthal - In the event of accidents on the streets of Bavaria, several, mostly young people, have died over the weekend.
An 18-year-old motorcyclist was caught on Saturday near Sch<0xC3><0xB6>nthal (Cham district) by a car that came onto the back track.
Why the car hit the opposite lane was initially unclear.
In Upper Bavaria on Saturday, a 22-year-old man collided with a horse-drawn carriage on his machine.
According to police, he was on his way downhill at Beilngries.
In a left-hand corner, he bumped into the carriage.
His injuries were so severe that he died at the scene of the accident.
Of the twelve occupants of the carriage, one man was seriously injured and one man slightly injured, police said.
In another fatal accident, an 18-year-old died in the Upper Palatinate town of Bad K<0xC3><0xB6>tzting.
He had put himself on a road on Sunday night and was overtaken by a 42-year-old driver.
Police suspect the 18-year-old was asleep.
The driver could no longer brake in time.
At Sch<0xC3><0xB6>nberg (district Freyung-Grafenau) on Saturday, a 57-year-old biker crashed into a right-hand corner in spite of full braking frontally against a car.
He died at the scene of the accident.
The 57-year-old driver suffered a shock, the other three people in the car remained uninjured.
The safety of motorcyclists was discussed on Saturday by the Bavarian Minister of Transport, Kerstin Schreyer (CSU).
In a letter to the organizer of the biker protests against driving bans announced for August, Gabor Kovacs, the minister referred to extensive investments such as under-steer protection on dashboards and the deterrence of dangerous curves.
“For the safety of motorcyclists, we have achieved a lot in recent years,” the letter said.
"The number of killed motorized bicyclists decreased by around 28 percent compared to 2011".
Kovac tests with Monaco against Frankfurt
Frankfurt/Main (dpa) - For football coach Niko Kovac there will soon be a reunion with Eintracht Frankfurt with his new club AS Monaco.
The eight-time French champion will be at the Hesse, the former club of Croatia, on 1 August at 6 p.m.
For the Bundesliga, it is the first and only test before the Europa League back-to-back against FC Basel (August 6).
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the meeting is held without spectators.
“We are especially looking forward to this game.
It’s always nice to come to Frankfurt and meet friends,” Kovac said.
“It’s an interesting test,” the 48-year-old said.
Prior to his move to FC Bayern Munich, Kovac had coached Hesse from 2016 to 2018 and led to victory in the DFB Cup.
"A top-class opponent like Monaco is a good test for us in terms of the game against Basel.
Like all Frankfurters, I look forward to seeing Niko Kovac again," said Eintracht coach Adi H<0xC3><0xBC>tter.
The 50-year-old Austrian had succeeded Croatia at the Eintracht.
In March, the Frankfurters had lost the eighth-final match against Basel in their own stadium with 0:3.
Almost 50 new infections: County of Hof just past the lockdown
In the district of Hof, the number of known new coronavirus infections on the weekend has increased further: from 39 on Friday and 43 on Saturday (one person has recovered and no longer falls in these statistics) to 47 on Sunday.
In addition, there is a case in the city of Hof.
Thus, the space court approaches the critical brand of 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants in a week.
700 killed by monsoon rains in Southeast Asia
More than 9 million people are affected by the severe floods in Southeast Asia, mainly in Bangladesh, India and Nepal.
A total of 700 people died due to heavy monsoon rains.
In Bangladesh, the Red Crescent is trying to reach the isolated people in boats.
Whole villages are under water.
The farmers have lost their crops.
Panzernasch<0xC3><0xB6>rner in National Park die from landslides
In Kaziranga National Park, several of the 120 tank rhinos died from landslides.
They are protected and considered endangered by extinction.
This year, the floods are particularly bad, which is due to climate change.
According to the United Nations, Bangladesh is one of the countries most affected by global warming.
New apartments are empty
In Cox’s Bazar, in the south of Bangladesh, the state has built apartments for 650 people displaced by the floods.
So far, only a few have moved in.
It's hard to get people to Cox's Bazar.
There is also enthusiasm in Grenez.
Anyone who used to have a house, even if it was so small and like a hut, often does not want to spend his life in a large residential block.
Many apartments are empty, but the government wants them to be taken over soon by those who have lost their homes due to the floods.

Argentina Refuses Creditors’ Counteroffer
The new demands could not be met, the Ministry of Economy in Buenos Aires said on Saturday.
"This would not only be irresponsible, but also unfair," it said in a statement.
"While 50 percent of children in Argentina live in poverty, we cannot increase the short-term profits of our creditors."
The debts of the second largest economy in South America are no longer viable under the current conditions.
That’s why Argentina is asking its private creditors to waive some of their claims of around $66 billion (around $59 billion).
If there is no agreement, the country is once again threatened by the state.
It would be the ninth default in Argentine history.
Most recently, lenders had demanded higher interest rates on government bonds and changes to some contractual clauses.
However, the Argentine government is sticking to its latest offer and is not ready for any further concessions.
Argentina is in a serious financial and economic crisis.
The rate of inflation was more than 50 percent.
For the current year, experts expect a decline in economic power of about ten percent.
At the end of May, Argentina had not paid interest receivables of US$503 million and had thus slipped into a limited default.
Arrived professionally - not yet privately
"It's going super well" - Dr. Stefanie Kramer draws this conclusion after her first days at the Notariat in Eggenfelden.
In the end, everything went very quickly: in mid-May, Dr. Stefanie Kramer learned that she will take on the successor of Lutz Feller at the Eggenfelden Notary Office.
Already six weeks later, at the beginning of July, the doctoral lawyer took up the job, the normal day-to-day business is already running on full tours.
"But I have to arrive privately," she explains in conversation with the Rottaler anzeiger and laughs.
The short lead time, of course, was not enough to move the food point from Regensburg completely to Eggenfelden, reports the native Dingolfingerin.
She is currently with her husband, who works as a judge at the district court in Regensburg, in search of a suitable apartment or house in the city.
At least her husband was still able to apply for short-term parental leave to ensure the care of the two daughters (31<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 and 11<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 years old).
In order not to have to commute every day from Regensburg, she also has a possibility to spend the night with her parents in Dingolfing, explains the 39-year-old.
Growing up in the neighbouring district, the city of Eggenfelden has long been a term for it.
When visiting the area with her family in the past months, she then again stated: "Eggenfelden is a really beautiful small town".
All the more pleased she was that she had made the race for the vacant position in the selection process.
Also in Dr. Stefanie Kramer’s professional career, her home in Lower Bavaria plays a central role: after studying law in Passau, she completed her term as a Referendarian and the 2nd State Examination in Regensburg.
After several posts as a notary, including in Rehau and Hof in Oberfranken, Babenhausen im Unterallg<0xC3><0xA4>u and Regensburg - during this time she also "besides" her doctorate in labour law - she took her first position as a notary in Rotthalm<0xC3><0xBC>nster in the district of Passau in 2012.
In 2016 she went into parenthood, it finally followed the move to Regensburg.
Since then, she has taken over representation services in various notarial offices.
When the post in Eggenfelden was advertised due to the imminent retirement of Lutz Feller, she had seen the right time for the full professional re-entry, the 39-year-old explains.
The team of her predecessor, who will take over the holiday representation in the notary office in the future, has completely taken over Dr. Stefanie Kramer - and immediately has a praise for the team of the law firm ready: "It is going super well!"
The fact that she can rely on recorded processes here makes it easier for her to take care of the upcoming relocation of the private food point.
In terms of kindergartens and cr<0xC3><0xA8>ches, she has already made contact with a local institution.
And if everything works as desired, she hopes to be able to follow her hobby here soon - and to get to know the most beautiful jogging routes of the Rottal.
BVB plans to start the league with a maximum of 15,000 spectators
Dortmund The biggest German football stadium in Dortmund will not be even 20 percent full at the start of the season in the event of a fan return.
“Due to the mandatory distance regulation, we are planning to have 12,000 to 15,000 spectators at the current level,” Borussia Dortmund CEO Carsten Cramer told the Daily Mirror.
Normally, the arena in the district city holds a little more than 81,000 spectators at Bundesliga games.
In the ghost games caused by the Corona pandemic last season, the BVB had lost about four million euros per game.
Cramer, who is responsible for marketing, digitalisation and internationalisation at BVB, hopes that, in addition to the normal seats, some of the around 4,000 seats in the hospitality sector can be reopened: "It is of course a blow to the office if these revenues break away completely".
In the face of the ongoing corona crisis, everyone is currently "well advised to take a stable side length for the first time".
“If many companies are not doing well and 6.8 million people are in short-time work in Germany alone, then the need for entertainment is limited,” Cramer said.
The Dortmund marketing chief praised the BVB professionals for their pay cut, which is intended to help overcome the crisis: "Of course, the players know that their pay cut has a different effect than if we put 100 people working in merchandising on short work."
Tiny Miracles: Early start to life with a few hundred grams
Hardly heavier than a packerl butter, just three tablespoons of blood in his entire body: that was Gabriel when he was born - he weighed exactly 273 grams.
The bub is one of about 400 premature babies who are cared for annually at the Graz Children’s Clinic.
A quarter of them weigh less than 1,500 grams, a few - like Gabriel and his brothers Raphael and Michael - are extreme lightweights with not even a kilogram of birth weight.
They are so small and born so early that neither the lungs, nor the intestines, nor the muscles are fully formed.
Their skin is sometimes so tender that they could injure the electrodes of an ECG.
And they are so tiny that they sometimes wear doll clothes and mini windlass specially made for them.
But not so small that they would not be by voice - "and how", smiles Berndt Urlesberger.
"Even if, of course, they don't scream quite as loud as big babies."
When the whiteboard becomes the stage
Despite Corona Theater in the Classroom: The Whiteboard as a stage experienced the 9th grade of the St. James High School in Abtsgm<0xC3><0xBC>nd just before the start of the holiday.
Actress Julia Sylvester from the theatre of the city of Aalen presented to the students the production "Das Heimatkleid" - by video.
The students were then able to chat via Skype with the actress and director Winfried Tobias about the play and the performance.
The idea for the performance format from the current Corona situation was born.
Teacher Teresa Nar was pleased with the enrichment of the teaching.
Even if at the end all the participants agreed that the direct encounter in the theatre and stage room would offer additional stimuli, you can also see in the theatre the potential for contact in the schools.
“If we continue to improve the technical framework, this could be an interesting addition to the game operation,” said director Winfried Tobias.
First round: the TSV 1860 would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the DFB-Pokal
Should the TSV 1860 qualify for the DFB Cup, the Lions will meet Eintracht Frankfurt in the first round.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday.
Munich - Sixty possible opponents in the first round of the DFB-Pokal stand out.
The Lions would meet Eintracht Frankfurt in a successful qualification.
This resulted in the draw on Sunday evening in the ARD Sportsshow.
Because due to the Corona pandemic, the field of participants is not yet complete, placeholders were used in the draw.
As a result of the voluntary dismissal of semi-final opponents FC Memmingen, the TSV 1860 is already in the final of the Bavarian Toto Cup (4th or 5th September).
There the lions meet either the W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburg Kickers or Viktoria Aschaffenburg.
Should the runner-up W<0xC3><0xBC>rzburg reach the final, Sixty would already qualify for the first round of the DFB-Pokal.
Otherwise, the Giesinger would have to prevail in the final against Regionalligist Aschaffenburg.
The first round of the DFB Cup will take place between 11 and 14 September, one week before the start of the third league.
"Vom Winde verwechtt": film legend Olivia de Havilland is dead
Film legend and Oscar winner Olivia de Havilland has died.
She died in Paris on Sunday at the age of 104, a spokeswoman for the German Press Agency confirmed.
De Havilland was known for her role as Melanie Hamilton in the South State Post "Vom Winde verwecht" (1939).
Born to British parents in Tokyo, Olivia de Havilland moved to California as a young child.
The Austrian theater man Max Reinhardt discovered the 19-year-old in the role of the Hermia of Shakespeare's "Summer Night's Dream".
Warner Brothers signed her to a seven-year contract and brought her out with Erol Flynn.
She made eight films with the Heartbreaker.
In 1946, she won her first Oscar in the lead role of "To Each His Own".
The film was released in Germany under the title "Mutterherz".
Three years later, the award for best actress came in William Wyler's "The Heiress".
Much recognition was also given to her as a neurotic eccentric in "The Dark Mirror" and "The Serpent's Pit".
Daphne du Maurier suggested her in 1952 for the lead role in the filming of her novel "My cousin Rachel".
The play became a worldwide success.
With her longtime friend Bette Davis, she starred in "Weighing Song for a Body".
From the marriage with the writer Marcus Goodrich (1946 to 1953) the son Benjamin emerged.
In Paris, de Havilland married journalist Pierre Paul Galante and had his daughter Gis<0xC3><0xA8>le with him.
This marriage also broke up.
Rumors of an affair with former British Prime Minister Edward Heath have never been confirmed.
"Road to Timmendorf": Beach volleyball: Thole/Wickler miss finale at Comeback
The World Cup runners-up Julius Thole and Clemens Wickler missed the final at the beach volleyball tournament "Road to Timmendorf".
At the meeting of the top teams in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf, they defeated their national team colleagues Nils Ehlers and Lars Fl<0xC3><0xBC>ggen in the semifinals with 1:2 (17:21, 21:17, 19:21).
Last September, Thole/Wickler played at the World Tour Final in Rome.
In the final game on the Rhine, their defeat of Ehlers/Fl<0xC3><0xBC>ggen against the surprise team Lukas Pfretschner and his interim partner Steven van de Velde was a defeat with 0:2 (17:21, 17:21).
In addition to the show tournament, three starting places for the German championships were played in Timmendorfer Strand at the beginning of September: the tickets were secured by Armin Dollinger/Simon Kulzer, Manuel Harms/Richard Peem<0xC3><0xBC>ller and Simon Pfretschner/Milan Sievers.
AfD's Kalbitz eviction confirmed - FDP speaks of "Feigenblatt"
The exclusion of Andreas Kalbitz from the AfD is, in the view of the FDP, only a "fig sheet" and does not change the character of the party.
"The AfD is the parliamentary arm of the far-right in Germany.
Andreas Kalbitz is only part of the tip of the iceberg of the radicals in the AfD," said FDP domestic politician Benjamin Strasser of the news agency dpa in Berlin.
The Federal Arbitration Court of the AfD had confirmed on Saturday in Stuttgart after several hours of negotiations the exclusion of Kalbitz, which the Federal Executive Board had majority decided in May.
Kalbitz is chairman of the AfD group in the Brandenburger Landtag.
"If the AfD were really about consistently removing right-wing extremists from their party, officials like Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn H<0xC3><0xB6>cke and his supporters would have long been excluded," Strasser said.
"But there is no political will in the AfD because right-wing extremism is now part of the party."
CSU Secretary General Markus Blume said: "The fact that Andreas Kalbitz is now excluded does not say anything and does not change anything," he told the "World on Sunday".
"It speaks volumes about how many frantic supporters a right-wing extremist in the middle of the AfD still has".
Blume expects that the AfD will again fall below five percent in elections in the future.
"The days of the AfD in parliaments are numbered".
Kalbitz was one of the spokesmen of the now officially dissolved "wing" around the Thuringian AfD country and faction chairman Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rn H<0xC3><0xB6>cke; the constitutional protection classifies the stream as a "secured right-wing extremist aspiration".
In May, the AfD’s Bundesverwaltung had expelled Kalbitz from the party.
As a reason, he stated that Kalbitz had not indicated a previous membership in the now banned right-wing extremist "Heimattreuen Deutschen Jugend" (HDJ) and among the Republicans at his party entry.
Kalbitz denies membership in the HDJ.
The chairman of the left faction in the Brandenburger Landtag, Sebastian Walter, also stressed that the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court does not change the character of the AfD: "The wolf has only eaten chalk.
The AfD remains a far-right party, with or without kalbitz".
With this decision, neither the federal party nor the right wing will be weakened.
"The maneuver of the Meuthen troop is comprehensible.
You want to avoid further observation by the constitutional protection and try to get under the radar," Walter said.
"The AfD will not let go of the ghosts it called.
A eviction does not change that yet," commented the Brandenburg SPD General Secretary Erik Stohn on the decision in the case of Kalbitz.
"Here the AfD country association and the faction kept to this day to their right-wing leader".
The legal dispute over Kalbitz’s membership in the AfD will continue.
He announced on Saturday that he will now proceed against the decision of the Federal Arbitration Court in civil law.
North Sea wind farms supply 21 percent more electricity
In the first six months of the year, the wind power plants on the German North Sea supplied 11.51 terawatt hours of electricity to the grid.
This is a good 21 percent more than in the same period of the previous year, said the network operator Tennet in Bayreuth.
Tennet is responsible for the transmission of the North Sea electricity to the mainland and the transmission through the German power grid.
The wind turbines on the Baltic Sea, which do not belong to the Tennet grid area, have supplied another 2.22 terawatt hours (TWh) of electricity.
In total, wind power from the North Sea and the Baltic Sea thus comes to 13.73 TWh, compared to 11.64 TWh in the first half of 2019.
The wind harvest at sea thus accounts for almost 19 percent of the total wind flow in Germany, which is about four percentage points more than a year ago.
New wind farms provide higher production capacities
The increased contribution of offshore wind energy is in addition to the wind conditions from higher production capacities, because in the last twelve months new wind farms have gone online.
If the 1,270 wind turbines in the North Sea were all running at full power at the same time, they could generate 6.7 gigawatts of electricity.
The transmission capacity is sufficient; according to Tennet, it is 7.1 gigawatts.
It is expected to increase to 17 gigawatts in the German North Sea by 2030.
“In Germany and the Netherlands, we are investing <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion in the expansion of offshore grid connections by then,” said Tennet CEO Tim Meyerj<0xC3><0xBC>rgens.
In reality, wind farms can not exhaust their capacity even at sea, but reach about 40 percent.
The previous record day this year is January 2, when the North Sea wind farms generated more than six gigawatts of electricity.
On average, the North Sea wind turbines produce about 2.5 to 3.0 gigawatts of electricity, which corresponds to three to four nuclear power plants.
This could supply nearly seven million households with electricity.
Art "Skirmish" - an exhibition by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold in the gallery of the Gm<0xC3><0xBC>nder Kunstverein.
This was almost a small anniversary celebration for the 130.
Gm<0xC3><0xBC>nder Kunstverein's birthday: The exhibition opening "Skirmish" with works by the Leipzig artist Christian Bold burst the usual frame after the Corona break.
Much more art lovers than usual followed the dialogue between the artist and the chairman of the Kunstverein, Professor Dr. Klaus Ripper.
The musical equivalent was delivered by the band "Defenders of the Universe" on the southern Kornhausplatz.
To the north of the gallery, the association "Sandtogether" was involved.
Freital: Windbergfest cancelled due to Corona
The Windbergfest will not take place this year.
The city of Freital has cancelled the planned three-day festival in September.
In other years, more than 30,000 people had visited this city festival.
"We certainly did not make this decision easy and - aware of how difficult it is economically for the parties involved - hoped until the last minute," said Mayor Uwe Rumberg (parteilos).
"But ultimately we are responsible here as the organizer for the health of many thousands of people".
Because if tens of thousands of people had streamed onto the land and into the tent, minimum distances, hygiene regulations and contact tracing in accordance with the current Corona Protection Regulation could not have been complied with.
Or the restrictions would have been so strong that there would not have been much left of a folk festival.
In addition, the organisational and monitoring effort would increase disproportionately by many times.
Rumberg trusted next year.
Then the city of Freital celebrates its 100th anniversary with, among other things, the Winterbergfest from 7 to 9 May 2021 and the Day of the Saxons from 10 to 12 September 2021.
Dressage Olympian Werth in Achleiten not to beat
Achleiten - The six-time Olympic champion Isabell Werth was the outstanding rider at the dressage tournament in the Austrian Achleiten.
The 51-year-old from Rheinberg came to four wins at four starts over the weekend.
After winning a Grand Prix at the start with Weihegold and Quantaz, she was also unbeaten in the Grand Prix Special on Sunday.
At the 15-year-old mare Weihegold, Werth won the special on Sunday against the Austrian Victoria Max-Theurer on Abegglen.
On Saturday, the German girl was clearly on Quantaz ahead of her 34-year-old student Victoria Max-Theurer.
Werth's winning horse Quantaz is owned by Max-Theurer.
The most successful dressage rider in the world is to establish the ten-year-old stallion in the Grand Prix.
For Quantaz, it was the first run at all.
Werth had already won all four important tests at the first tournament in Achleiten three weeks ago.
The last of the three international tournaments is scheduled for August 14-16.
In the future, more air traffic controllers in Worms
The Worms University of Applied Sciences continues to rise: the "DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung" establishes a professorship for "Air Traffic Management".
A corresponding contract between the university and the DFS has now been signed in Worms.
The contract was initially concluded for three years and will start in 2021.
With the professorship there is the possibility to allow the beginning of studies not only in the summer, but also in the winter semester.
This means that twice as many students can be trained as before.
At the same time, the capacities of both the university and the flight safety academy of the DFS are used evenly.
The DFS will advise the university on the establishment and staffing of the professorship.
Represented at the University since 2019
Since the summer semester 2019, the first students in the course of their training in air traffic control at Worms University of Applied Sciences are in the Air Traffic Management program.
Nine students have already started this year.
So far, the experiences of the DFS are very positive, the achievements of the students are excellent.
The combination of study and pilot training contributes significantly to further increase the attractiveness of the pilot profession.
"In these times, economic support is not easy for us.
However, we firmly expect air traffic to recover and grow again in the long term.
In order to fulfil our legal mandate in the future, we need highly qualified staff," says Professor Klaus-Dieter Scheurle, Chairman of the Managing Director of DFS at the signing of the contract.
"For the DFS, the professorship of the foundation is a future-proof investment that will provide air traffic controllers with a broad, comprehensive knowledge base in the long term.
We therefore continue the good cooperation with the university and at the same time support our attractiveness as an employer."
Professor Dr. Jens Hermsdorf, President of the Worms University of Applied Sciences, also emphasizes this: "The professorship of the foundation forms an important bridge between science and business.
With it, we would like to build on the already existing cooperation with DFS Deutsche Flugsicherung as a practical partner for the dual Bachelor’s programme Air Traffic Management”.
At the same time, the trust of Deutsche Flugsicherung is the motivation and commitment of Worms University of Applied Sciences to further develop its teaching and research expertise in the future fields of air transport.
In its use for tomorrow’s air traffic controllers, the university can set very special highlights and innovative priorities for its students with the first foundation professorship for a dual degree program.
Dr. Denis Alt, State Secretary at the Ministry of Science, Education and Culture, emphasizes: "The University of Worms has a unique feature in Rhineland-Palatinate with its focus on air transport.
Today's signing of the cooperation agreement strengthens the profile of the university".
Rescue helicopter lands on the A 45
Around 30 minutes, the A 45 motorway was closed on Saturday afternoon in the direction of Aschaffenburg, as the rescue helicopter was in use after a traffic accident.
A 76-year-old man drove a Ford around 12.40 p.m. in the Alzenau-Mitte exit in the curve and landed on the guide board.
Due to the impact, the front airbags triggered, the driver suffered minor injuries to his face and had to be taken to a hospital for treatment.
The injuries of the 72-year-old passenger were taken care of by the emergency doctor and the patient flew to a hospital with the rescue helicopter.
At the moment, however, the police assume that there is no risk to life.
The damaged vehicle, which caused a damage of about 2000 euros, had to be towed off.
Heil wants to check other industries after meat industry
The corona crisis brought to light the conditions in parts of the meat industry once again.
Law tightening is just around the corner.
But are they right – and will they stay?
Federal Minister of Labour Hubertus Heil (SPD) wants to check other sectors according to the now planned strict regulations against abuses in the meat industry.
"We will look at the industry for the industry and then take appropriate measures for the respective industry if necessary," Heil told the German Press Agency in Berlin.
Germany’s employers have already warned against restricting work contracts in general.
After the massive corona outbreak at the meat giant T<0xC3><0xB6>nnies in North Rhine-Westphalia, the Federal Cabinet wants to pass a law of salvation this Wednesday.
Large-scale slaughterhouses should no longer be allowed to employ foreign personnel in slaughtering, dismembering and meat processing.
For this purpose, the use of works contract and rental workers is to be prohibited there.
Ingo Kramer, the DPA’s president, said: “Finger away from a general restriction on labour contracts and employee handovers if you don’t want to completely stifle the economy.”
For example, works contracts are essential for large areas of the craft industry, the construction industry and plant construction to create value for the customer.
"The faults of individuals cannot destroy such an important instrument".
Heil assured: "My goal is not to ban works contracts anywhere in the German economy".
Work contracts make sense.
"If an industrial company hires a craftsman to install a safety system, this is a very normal works contract".
The German meat industry considers a ban on works contracts and leases in its industry alone to be unconstitutional.
It is inexplicable why in the future, when portioning and packaging cheese should apply labor law other than sausage, it says in a statement on the bill, as reported by the "Neue Osnabr<0xC3><0xBC>cker Zeitung" (Saturday).
In the event of a ban, the consumer price would increase by 10 to 20 percent per kilo and product.
Often Eastern European employees from works contract companies worked in the industry after the results of an audit of the NRW-Labour Protection Administration partly 16 hours a day.
They often didn’t have a break.
Salary was reserved for protective equipment or rent.
It was also found that the situation at the accommodation of employees was often miserable.
Heil said a relatively sharp law had already come into force in 2017 for the meat industry.
However, by "tricky constructions" these have been circumvented.
"Now it has to be fundamentally cleaned up".
The politician announced: "In the Labour Protection Act, which we want to pass in the cabinet at the end of July, there are also measures that affect not only the meat industry - for example, higher test rates for labour protection or clear criteria for community accommodation".
The draft presented by the DPA includes amendments to the Law on the Protection of Workers’ Rights in the Meat Industry and the Labour Protection Act.
Brandenburg’s Minister of Consumer Protection Ursula Nonnemacher (Greens) considers more intensive controls necessary.
"I would like us to be able to do even more checks in many areas of supervision: food controls, animal welfare, everything possible, for example, animal transport," Nonnemacher said on Sunday in the RBB broadcast "Brandenburg aktuell".
However, more staffing is also needed for more controls.
Three dead in crash of ultralight aircraft in Germany
According to the police, three people died when an ultralight plane crashed on a multi-family house in Wesel in the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia.
A child was slightly injured.
Two more people were injured in the accident, a spokesman for the Wesel district office said.
A parachute was found at the scene, police said.
The "Rheinische Post" reported, citing eyewitnesses, that before the crash the plane collided with a hot air balloon.
The house is a one- or two-family house.
Further details were initially not known.
eviction of Frankfurt Opera House in peace
A week after the riots in Frankfurt, the eviction of the opera house on Sunday night was also peaceful.
Finally, a few dozen people stopped in the square, but left it before the start of the curfew at 1 a.m.
The police had been in operation since the early evening with numerous officers, a larger police order was seen throughout the city area.
This weekend, for the first time since midnight, there was a ban on entering the Opera House, which had been in turmoil a week ago.
Police officers had been attacked with bottles from the crowd of celebrants.
At least five officers were injured after police reports said several police vehicles were damaged.
Saturday night was quiet as well.
Car overturns: Young woman seriously injured in accident on Bundesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 83 near Hofgeismar
In an accident between Sch<0xC3><0xB6>neberg and H<0xC3><0xBC>mme, a 21-year-old woman suffered serious injuries on Sunday at around 1325 hours.
She was taken to the Kassel Clinic.
With thermal imaging cameras, the fire brigade was looking for possible passengers.
According to police, the woman was on her way to her hometown of H<0xC3><0xBC>mme on Bundesstra<0xC3><0x9F>e 83 when her car got off the road from the road and crashed several times.
In order to save the injured, the fire department had to cut off the roof of the car.
Since it was not clear if anyone else was in the vehicle, the adjacent corn field was scanned from the whirlpool with a thermal imaging camera.
The drone staff from Warburg, which also works with thermal imaging cameras, had also been ordered for the search for persons.
However, no one was found among the tall corn plants.
The seriously injured person was taken by ambulance to the Kassel hospital for further care.
Almost 50 fire brigade personnel from Hofgeismar, H<0xC3><0xBC>mme and Sch<0xC3><0xB6>neberg were on site.
The road was closed for two hours due to the accident.
Juventus Turin Champions in Italy
Turin - After a goal by Cristiano Ronaldo, record champion Juventus Turin has secured the Italian championship for the ninth time in a series.
The team around the five-time world footballer made the 36th Scudetto in club history with a 2:0 (1:0) on Sunday evening in the home game against Sampdoria Genoa perfect.
Ronaldo scored 1-0 ahead of halftime.
With 83 points, Turin, without the last long-injured ex-national player Sami Khedira, is no longer able to push away from place one two days before the end of the Serie A season.
The Inter Milan standings are seven points behind.
Juventus were harmless in the first half despite optical superiority, then Ronaldo met after a free-kick variant with the last action.
A play by Miralem Pjanic used the 35-year-old directly from the penalty area with a flat shot (45.+7).
Ronaldo was also involved in the 2-0 against the now more offensive guests, after his shot, Federico Bernardeschi (67.) dusted off.
This ensured the unspeakable but decisive success.
In the 89th minute, only Ronaldo himself, with a view to the goalie's score, is likely to have scored correctly.
“It’s complicated to stay mentally and physically at ball level for 90 minutes.
The games are strange, and the momentum changes very easily," said coach Maurizio Sarri after the 1:2 at Udinese Calcio on Thursday.
Especially the mental exhaustion of his players was great, said the Juve coach.
Because of the defeat, the Turiners had not yet been able to make the championship perfect.
Juve’s calming lead at the top of the table was ultimately due to the weakness of its competitors.
Because in the eleven games before the game on Sunday, the Sarri team had only five wins.
Whether Ronaldo will still be king of goaltenders is questionable.
While the Portuguese superstar has scored 31 goals so far, the former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile has already scored 34 goals in his account after his three-pack at the 5:1 (1:1) Lazio Roma quarterfinal at Hellas Verona - as many as Robert Lewandowski contributed to the title win of FC Bayern.
The record in Italy is held by the current Juve pro Gonzalo Higua<0xC3><0xAD>n.
The Argentine scored 36 goals for SSC Napoli in the 2015/2016 season.
In August, the "Old Lady" of Italian football is waiting for the next title chance.
Juventus are in the Champions League final, but on August 7 against Olympique Lyon, they have to take a 0-1 lead to reach the final tournament in Lisbon.
In the next K.o. round, Real Madrid or Manchester City would wait as opponents.
Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg: More than 250 illegal car races recorded
Despite all the threatened penalties and court rulings, drivers continue to gas in countless illegal races on the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg roads: In the past year and the first four months of this year, police in the southwest have already registered more than 250 illegal car races.
Although there are no comparable figures for the previous years, the Raser are increasingly working for the judicial authorities: in 2018, a total of 155 investigations were conducted between Konstanz and Mannheim, a year later there were already 252 and in the current year until the beginning of June already 151.
The races were less about organized events, as evidenced by the response of the Ministry of the Interior to a request from the Landtags-SPD.
In most cases, the drivers spontaneously confronted each other or they had taken the escape from the police - this is also shown as an illegal race.
German men between the ages of 18 and 60 were mainly in the driver’s seat.
113 fines - 15 times imprisonment
Only in comparatively few cases are the rasers caught and also asked for cash: According to the Ministry of the Interior, a total of 113 fines and 15 prison sentences have been imposed since 2018.
However, there are no indications that the number of illegal car races is actually increasing.
Rather, other drivers reacted more sensitively than before because of the many tragic accidents and processes of past years, and indicated more frequently, a ministry spokesman said.
Especially popular with Rasern is the highway 8. Time and again, drivers brake off traffic there in order to gain space and use the free track for a race.
Last August, a dozen drivers were caught near Kirchheim under Teck, three months earlier there were even 18 drivers on the A8 at Merklingen.
A81 is the most popular "race track"
On the A81, the police register even more races than on any other federal highway.
With a speed limit, an attempt is made to brake the rasers on the particularly affected section between the narrow and the geysers.
The mostly high-priced and soggy sports and luxury cars often have Swiss badges, because the drivers dodge to the lawn in Germany due to the high penalties for speeding and car racing in the neighboring country.
For the SPD, the speed limit must not be reduced to a few routes: "With a general speed limit of 130 km/h, we would create this problem on motorways from the body," says Martin Rivoir, the transport expert of the SPD Landtagsfaction.
“The threshold for racers would be significantly higher if you weren’t still legally on the road at 200 kilometers per hour and more.”
Rivoir thinks less of enlightenment or image campaigns: "He who in this way goes beyond all rules and not only puts his own life, but also the lives of other road users at stake, is hardly accessible with reason".
ADAC calls for stronger police intervention
This is not enough for the ADAC, however: "We assume that Raser cannot be deterred from the speed limits," says Holger Bach, Head of Transport and Environment at ADAC W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg.
It calls for additional and tougher controls on the affected routes.
It is not uncommon for the high-speed power fair to become painful and consequentially serious: since January 2019 and until April 2020, three people died at the races nationwide, two of them uninvolved in a nighttime crash in Stuttgart’s city centre and one in Gerlingen.
In November, two young men are said to have taken part in a car race.
One of the vehicles came off the road, slammed against a garden wall and lay on the side, the 18-year-old passenger died.
Twenty-one other people have been injured in the race over the past two years.
However, according to Interior Minister Thomas Strobl, stricter penalties are not necessary: "Legislative action needs to be taken to sanction illegal motor vehicle racing more harshly is not seen," the Interior Ministry said in the paper.
Blue light from July 23: Thirsty burglar steals drinks from snack
Rohrdorf: A man broke into a snack on Thursday in Rohrdorf (Calw district) and stole drinks and cash.
A witness heard noises in the valley road at about 3.40 a.m. and ran towards the entrance.
There he noticed a man using drinks at the refrigerator and leaving the snack afterwards through a previously slammed front door.
The perpetrator fled towards the meadows behind the snack.
According to police, the burglar also used a cash register and stole cash in the low three-digit range.
The suspect is described as follows: He is about 1.75 to 1.80 meters tall and of strong stature.
In fact, he was wearing a black hoodie, black pants and light shoes.
Further witness statements are received by the police.
Ackermann sprints to victory on final stage at Sibiu Tour
Cycling pro Pascal Ackermann has won his second day's victory at the final stage of the 10th Sibiu Tour.
The 26-year-old Palatinate rider from Team Bora-hansgrohe finished in mass sprint on the 109-kilometer section with start and finish in Hermannstadt after already winning a stage on Saturday.
It was the season wins three and four for Ackermann.
In the overall ranking, his Austrian teammate Gregor M<0xC3><0xBC>hlberger prevailed.
The 26-year-old had sovereignly decided the mountain time ride for himself in the morning and thus took the top in the ranking.
Only 104 drivers had entered the final stage in the evening.
No less than 18 starters had fallen victim to the time limit in the mountain time trial.
"I'm really happy to start the season restart with a win," Ackermann said after his success on Saturday.
“The sprint was really hectic,” said the 26-year-old.
300 meters before the goal, he simply put on his sprint, "and it also worked perfectly".
According to the rules of the UCI, a corona test was carried out six days before the start of the race for all participants and their companions.
During the entire tour, drivers and attendants were separated from the organization team and the media in isolated hygiene bubbles.
Spectators at start and finish were not allowed.
The head office gave instructions for layman's resuscitation
D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf - Tragic accident on Sunday afternoon in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf-Garath.
In a multi-family house, a child (4) was suddenly lifeless in the water while bathing.
According to the fire department, the emergency call went in shortly before 1 p.m.
"A dispatcher immediately gave instructions for layman's resuscitation," a fire department spokesman told BILD.
The incoming rescuers took over the resuscitation measures a little later.
The child, who was in danger of death, was transported to the clinic under resuscitation.
Why it happened is unclear.
The police have routinely started investigations into the accident.
The fire department spokesman said: "We are proceeding from a tragic accident in the apartment."
N<0xC3><0xBC>rnberg: Unapproved tuning meeting - police attack, 700 vehicles and around 1100 people
Hundreds of cars and temporarily over 1000 people participated in a "tuning meeting" on Saturday night in the parking lot of a furniture house.
The police implemented their announcement to control such events more closely.
A large tuning meeting took place on Saturday evening (July 25, 2020) in Nuremberg’s southern city.
Several hundred vehicles were involved.
According to the Mittelfranken police, an increased vehicle volume in the area of a large parking lot in Ingolst<0xC3><0xA4>dter Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e was detected by the Nuremberg traffic police around 22.30.
After that, the police carried out a variety of vehicle checks there.
Only recently, the police had announced that they wanted to step up action against so-called autoposer.
Illegal tuning meetings in Nuremberg: only a small part from the "scene"
The officers numbered at the top well 700 vehicles and about 1100 people, according to the police.
Of this, however, only a small part of those present should be assigned to the "autoposer" and tuning scene.
Apparently, most of the relevant scene followed the police’s appeal.
On the basis of the vehicles and persons located on the site, it should be assumed that these were mostly noiseless vehicles.
In addition, the vast majority of those present adhered to the applicable infection protection provisions, in particular the observance of the minimum distance and the wearing of a mouth-nose protection.
The control measures carried out on-site had been completed by 1:00 a.m.
In total, the officials found in 10 vehicles such structural changes that the operating permit had expired.
Four of these vehicles had to be secured.
No car races
There were no illegal car races.
"The Central Franconia Police Bureau will continue to keep an eye on what is happening and will continue to carry out enhanced control measures, including in connection with the emergence of actors," it said.
The agency News5 spoke to J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Schr<0xC3><0xB6>dinger of the involved towing company: "They all have beautiful rims, which we must not scratch," Schr<0xC3><0xB6>dinger said.
For this purpose, special tapes would be used.
Also because the cars are wider, the company has to be careful not to do any damage.
"The young people should finally get their cars back unharmed".
Employment agency figures: 900 suspected cases of abuse in the case of short-time work
Berlin - According to its own statement, the Federal Employment Agency (BA) is investigating around 900 suspected cases of abuse of short-time workers' money.
"This is extremely low for more than 880,000 companies that have reported short-time work," said Daniel Terzenbach, chief operating officer at Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung.
When, at the beginning of the Corona crisis, many companies suddenly applied for short-term work, the BA had to react quickly.
The exam usually takes up to three weeks.
"So much time was not available to us in this hot phase.
The more closely we will look at the final accounts.
I'm sure there'll be a lot more to come.
We are not naive and have a long breath.”
Indications of abuse often come from the affected employees or trade unions.
In addition, the BA analysis software is used to detect patterns of abuse.
According to Terzenbach, the BA is preparing for a possible insolvency wave in the autumn.
"Will there be significantly more bankruptcies than in the previous year?
The estimates differ, but we are preparing ourselves in case of the case and are already training our employees in the employment agencies for processing applications for insolvency money".
The numbers are still inconspicuous, Terzenbach said.
World Heritage in Potsdam: Party dissolved in the New Garden
Potsdam - On Friday evening, about 40 young people celebrated a party in the New Garden.
The collection was dissolved at 20.48 by the district drivers of the Prussian Palaces and Gardens Foundation (SPSG), the foundation said at the request of PNN.
The boys then left the park.
On Saturday night, some young people would have played rugby in the New Garden.
The meadow was cleared by district drivers, SPSG spokesman Frank Kallensee said on Sunday.
There are always illegal celebrations in the parks.
In the parks of the Foundation, there are often gatherings where the distance and hygiene rules of the Covid-19 ordinance are not respected.
At the end of June, a celebration with about 300 people took place in the Park Babelsberg, a week later about 150 people celebrated in the New Garden.
Even without the Corona Ordinance, the parks will be closed in the event of a blackout.
Storage on the meadows is prohibited according to park regulations, there are only a few exceptions.
The Foundation has long complained that visitors would leave more and more garbage and destroy protected biotopes.
In Berlin, illegal park parties have reached a different dimension.
In the Hasenheide in the district of Neuk<0xC3><0xB6>lln, on the night of Sunday, 5,000 people celebrated an illegal techno party.
The event was cancelled by the police.
Austria: Mass tests after coronavirus outbreak in tourist resort
With hundreds of tests, authorities have responded to a coronavirus outbreak in the popular Upper Austrian tourist resort of St. Wolfgang.
The number of confirmed cases increased to 48, according to the state authorities in Linz.
There were more than 100 results in the evening.
According to this, many of the infected young interns are in tourism companies, but at least one holiday guest has been tested positive.
Residents, guests and tourism workers were asked to stay in their accommodations on Saturday night.
The curfew was set at 11 p.m.
"There are cancellations and cancellations there and there" of bookings, said the head of the Wolfgangsee tourism association, Hans Wieser, the dpa.
Some of the guests also left early.
St. Wolfgang is the most important tourist resort in Upper Austria, with more than 400,000 overnight stays last year.
In a normal season, about a third of guests are German.
On Friday, the first infections were made public.
On Saturday, the head of the district authority, Alois Lanz, defended the behavior of the interns, who had celebrated in several locales and may have become infected there.
"We all liked to do this in our youth," he told radio station <0xC3><0x96>1.
However, two bars were closed on Friday to prevent further infections.
The Tourism Association launched an information campaign to raise awareness among young employees about the dangers of Covid-19.
From Saturday onwards, hundreds of employees, holidaymakers and locals were tested.
In addition, all guests who were in St. Wolfgang from July 15 were contacted.
The outbreak evokes memories of the Austrian ski and party resort of Ischgl in Tyrol, which was a center of corona spread throughout Europe in the early stages of the pandemic.
In total, more than 1500 people are currently infected with the virus in Austria.
The focus of the new infections are Vienna and Upper Austria.
Premier League: Man United and Chelsea qualified for Champions League
London (dpa) - English football record champion Manchester United returns to the Champions League after a year's absence.
On the final day of the Premier League, the Red Devils secured third place by a 2-0 (0:0) win against their direct rival Leicester City.
The Foxes now have to settle for the Europa League, because the FC Chelsea still passed and qualified for the fourth also for the royal class.
In the fight against the descent, Aston Villa was allowed to cheer.
Manchester United led by a penalty kick from Bruno Fernandes (71st minute).
After a red card for Leicester City in the postseason, Jesse Lingard (90.+8) hit the finish line.
Chelsea, in the Champions League-eighth final opponents of FC Bayern, won thanks to Mason Mount (45.+1) and Olivier Giroud (45.+4) in parallel with 2:0 (2:0) against the Wolverhampton Wanderers.
"That means a lot to me," said coach Frank Lampard, who is also in the FA Cup final against Arsenal in his first season as Chelsea coach.
Tottenham Hotspur also benefited from Chelsea's win against Wolverhampton, who went past the Wolves with a slim 1:1 (1:0) at Crystal Palace and started sixth in the Europa League.
Aston Villa decided the long-distance match with Watford and Bournemouth, but had to shake for a long time at West Ham United to maintain the class.
The late leader of Jack Grealish (84th) immediately equalled Andrej Jarmolenko (85th).
The 1:1 (0:0) was enough, however, because Watford lost 2:3 (1:3) at Arsenal.
The club, which shot three coaches in the season, will retire after five first-league years.
Just like Bournemouth, who couldn’t save himself by a 3-1 (2:1) at Everton.
In the end, there was a point missing.
Liverpool, who have been the English champions since the end of June, secured a club record with a 3-1 (1:1) win at Newcastle United.
99 is the highest score the Reds have ever scored in a football season.
Coach J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Klopp and his team narrowly missed the points record in English football.
The best-scorer holds Manchester City with 100 points in the 2017/18 season.
Virgil van Dijk (38th), Divock Origi (59th) and Sadio Mané (89th) made the first-minute lead on Sunday for Liverpool.
"For this wonderful club it was an extraordinary season," said Torsch<0xC3><0xBC>tze van Dijk after the game, "that should spur us to defend the title.
It's going to be hard."
In the end, the Premier League boss will be satisfied.
Due to the coronavirus crisis, football operations in England had been interrupted from 13 March to 17 June.
In the meantime, there has even been a discussion about an early break-up or a playoff of the remaining games on neutral ground.
After all, the season could be played without special events - but as in Germany without spectators in the stadiums.
Arrests and violence in demonstrations against Netanyahu
The protests in Israel against Netanyahu are getting more and more violent.
During the night, there were violent clashes.
Israeli police violently staged a demonstration against the right-wing leader Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday night in Jerusalem.
Twelve people have been arrested for participating in riots, police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said.
The police, among other things, used water cannons to dissolve the rally.
In total, according to media reports on Saturday evening, around 6,000 people had gathered near Netanyahu’s headquarters.
They protested against unemployment, corruption and Netanyahu’s handling of the coronavirus crisis.
The protesters hit drums, blew horns, and called on Netanyahu to step down.
Participants of a counter-demonstration supporting Netanyahu were also arrested, the news site “ynet” reported.
Also in many other places in Israel, people demonstrated, including in front of the private villa of the head of government in the coastal city of Caesarea and in a park in Tel Aviv.
A man was arrested near Tel Aviv on suspicion of spraying pepper spray on streetside protesters from a moving car, police said.
Another man was arrested after a knife attack on a protester in the south of the country.
The protestor was slightly injured in the neck.
In Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, there have been several demonstrations against Netanyahu.
The protests are accompanying the corruption process against the head of government.
Recently, Netanyahu has also been criticized for his handling of the Corona crisis.
Among other things, he is subject to premature easing and a lack of preparation for a second corona wave.
The Corona crisis has made the country’s economy more difficult.
The unemployment rate was more than 20 percent.
The number of new infections with the coronavirus in Israel has recently risen to record highs.
Accident at Ahlen (NRW) - Transporter force on car - nine injured - Ruhrgebiet - Bild.de
Ahlen - An ascent accident on Saturday afternoon on the B58 in Ahlen caused nine minor injuries.
A driver was travelling with her two children (3, 5) towards Beckum.
Police said: "She probably had suddenly braked because she wanted to turn away."
The driver of a Mercedes transporter driving behind her must have seen it too late.
He pushed on the back of the car.
Three occupants in the car and six in the van were slightly injured in the accident.
Several ambulances took them to a nearby hospital.
North Korea settles border city after suspected coronavirus case
To date, North Korea has seen a “bright success” in its own measures to fight the coronavirus.
Now, for the first time, the country is reporting a suspected case.
North Korea has completely shut down a major city for fear of a disaster due to the country’s first official coronavirus case.
Despite stringent epidemiological defenses over the past six months, "the malicious virus could have been smuggled into the country," state media reported.
For the region around the border city of Kaesong, the state of emergency was imposed.
The Communist leadership raised the highest level of alarm.
If confirmed, it would be the first official case of Sars-CoV-2 infection in the country.
North Korea has not registered a single infection so far and described its defenses as a “bright success.”
The information was questioned abroad.
The symptoms of the disease were reportedly found in a "extremist" who illegally crossed the military demarcation line between South and North Korea on July 19.
He moved to South Korea three years ago and has now returned across the border.
For the border crossing within the four-kilometer-wide and largely still-mined military buffer zone, there was initially no confirmation from South Korea.
South Korea’s military, however, admitted the possibility of an illegal border crossing into North Korea as high, according to reports from the national news agency Yonhap.
Investigations were carried out on some people.
North Korea called an emergency meeting of the Workers’ Party’s political office under the chairmanship of leader Kim Jong Un on Saturday because of the suspicion.
The “dangerous situation in Kaesong could trigger a deadly and destructive catastrophe.”
Kim had already ordered Friday as a preventive measure, "to completely block Kaesong and isolate each district and the region from others," it said.
The person concerned and all the people in Kaesong who had been in contact with him were placed under quarantine.
The party’s central military commission is therefore to investigate the “extradition case” as well as the conduct of the responsible military unit and, if necessary, impose harsh penalties.
An estimated 300,000 people live in Kaesong.
Tension before the Council meeting: City-East and noise protection are still before a big summer break for discussion
"In addition to environmental issues, the committee members will also vote on the construction plan for the large-scale urban development project East," the city press release for the next municipal council meeting on Tuesday, July 28, at 4.30 p.m. in the Great Hall of the CongressCentre Pforzheim, says rather casually.
However, especially the appreciation of the eastern city is controversially discussed until the end.
The majority for this is narrow, most recently in individual committees even rejecting it, depending on the presence.
An appeal from the economy (construction, real estate, trade and IT) that the project developed from the citizenship and then from the administration and the municipal council did not fail after almost ten years of preparation, opponents of the project criticized Reinhard Klein as "out-of-parliamentary opposition", "unthinkable", "speculation", "disgusting" and "conscious".
"Everyone thinks they know better," said Klein, who has been on the municipal council for a year as the only representative of the Pforzheim citizens' list.
In fact, after reading the contracts, he was in this position: "I know what I'm talking about".
The exit comes cheaper to the city, the Technical Town Hall is contrary to the statements of the city administration after grants, whose existence Klein is convinced to renovate for 8.5 million euros.
The city will develop quite differently than one predicts in the town hall and on the part of the supporters from the economy.
To design the city by its own power and not by an investor: that is its plan B. One day after Klein, the FDP/FW/UB/LED group, which also rejects the project, presented an alternative concept.
It also essentially provides for the renovation of the Technical City Hall, the opening of the Schlossberg, the rental of the Ex-Thale for administrative areas and a smaller inner-city conversion ideally with local carriers.
Environmental issues play a central role
In addition, environmental issues in particular will play a central role.
Thus, the municipal council will vote on, among other things, the lesson plan.
This includes various measures to protect the Pforzheim population from health noise pollution caused by road traffic, many of which include speed reductions.
In a press release, the local transport club Germany welcomes the widespread introduction of Tempo 30. However, the political leaders in the city are not innocent of the fact that this has to happen because they have to do so by neglecting the line bus traffic with thinned clocks and by having little commitment to the traffic of bicycles, so to the massive increase in traffic.
The municipal council also votes on the participation of the city of the energy and climate protection agency Pforzheim/Enzkreis.
In addition, the agenda includes the accession to the climate pact of the state of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg, the redetermination of parental contributions in the urban day care facilities and the application for inclusion in the smart city funding of the federal government.
Citizens are welcome, but they must take corona protection measures.
Tim Zimmermann starts the new season with a lot of delay
With a delay of almost half a year, Tim Zimmermann will start his debut season at the ADAC GT Masters on July 31.
Before the league of super sports cars can start regular operation, the first test drives were now on.
For Zimmermann, it was all about getting to know his Lamborghini Huracan GT3.
The Corona crisis has long prevented Tim Zimmermann from embarking on his first service in Grasser Racing’s new Lamborghini Huracan.
This was now possible under special hygiene conditions.
The 23-year-old Langenargen turned his first laps on the Lausitzring and got used to his debut in the GT3 car.
“There are already a few things that are different from the Porsche from the pre-season,” says Zimmermann.
"With ABS, for example, you have to go into the curves differently.
But it really was a lot of fun.”
Zimmermann also had fun with Steijn Schothorst, with whom he will share his orange sports car in the GT Masters.
The Dutchman, despite only 25 years of experience in GT sports, has been able to help his new teammate in many things.
“I’m not a beginner in motorsport, but every new series brings new challenges,” says Zimmermann.
"Steijn and I understand each other dazzlingly and we have also made tremendous progress at the Lausitzring from session to session".
Right there – at the Lausitzring – the GT Masters will also run its first race.
From 31 July, the 33 super sports cars will race through the Lusatia.
Zimmermann, who is one of 15 series finalists, knows the track.
In 2015 he was the last guest at the Motodrom.
"It worked quickly and I had to get used to the track a little," says Zimmermann, who starts for the Friedrichshafen racing community Graf Zeppelin.
"The Lausitzring has a lot of fast passages that you have to hit optimally to be fast".
How fast Zimmermann really is then, it turns out in two weeks.
"Of course, the teams play a little poker during the tests," he says.
"Ultimately, however, we are very satisfied and look forward to the first weekend at the Lausitzring".
The race in Brandenburg will be the start of a busy calendar.
There are seven races until the beginning of November.
The current status is that no spectators will be allowed - but there is a prominent guest.
In mid-August at the N<0xC3><0xBC>rburgring, former Formula 1 driver Niko H<0xC3><0xBC>lkenberg will hit the GT steering wheel.
British Transport Minister Caught Cold by Quarantine Decision
The British government’s decision to quarantine Spanish holidaymakers for two weeks after their return has caught the country’s transport minister cold, according to press reports.
According to him, Grant Shapps is currently on holiday in Spain, while his colleagues decided to take the measure at home on Saturday.
Due to the increase in the number of corona cases in Spain, the Cabinet in London has removed the country from the list of countries from which entry is possible without quarantine.
The new rule will apply from today, Sunday, so Shapps will also have to quarantine after his return.
In Austria, the government has also imposed quarantine measures on returnees.
But the rule applies to those who are just on the day of the holiday, only from Saturday, August 1, and was not introduced overnight.
By the way, Spain is still considered to be one of the "safe countries" for which no quarantine is required in Austria.
"Numerous ministers are likely to have known in advance that there is a possibility that a quarantine will be imposed on holidaymakers in Spain," said Diane Abbot, a Labour MP.
"But apparently no one has bothered to tell Grant Shapps".
Almost a month after the end of the corona emergency in Spain and the expiration of the strict exit ban, infection numbers in the country are rising again.
Virologists, in particular, make the nightlife responsible for the new spread.
Spain is one of the favourite holiday countries of the British.
Unnecessary travel to the Spanish mainland is currently discouraged by the British government, with the exception of the Canary and Balearic Islands, which are particularly popular with British holidaymakers.
So far, more than 272,000 infections with the novel coronavirus and more than 28,000 deaths have been registered in Spain.
Russia: Navy Day: Putin announces hypersonic weapons for warships
Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced on the day of the Navy in his country the equipment of the warships with the most modern hypersonic weapons.
With these weapons unique in the world, the combat capabilities of the Russian naval forces would be expanded, Putin said on Sunday in St. Petersburg at the central naval parade.
The Ministry of Defense also informed the agency Interfax about successful tests of the zircon hypersonic missile built for the Navy.
The hypersonic weapons have a multiple of the speed of sound of about 343 meters per second.
They are the weapons of the future.
Underwater tropedeo is being built
It was also built on the Poseidon underwater torpedo, which can be equipped with nuclear weapons.
The planned sea drone is planned to destroy coastal targets.
The president, who himself also drove a military boat, said that this year alone, 40 new ships would be put into service with the individual fleet associations of the largest country on earth.
Russia has such a large coastal area as no other country in the world.
For 300 years, the Navy has reliably protected Russia, Putin said on the day celebrated by sailors nationwide.
Also in many other Russian coastal locations, the naval forces begin the day of the Navy with parades.
In Syria, where Russia is fighting alongside Bashar al-Assad, the military demonstrated strength at a weapons show in the Mediterranean port of Tartus.
Ammunition was also fired.
A video released by the Ministry of Defense showed not only warships, including a submarine, but also combat helicopters and jets.
Hurricane "Hanna" reaches Texas: help made difficult due to Corona
Washington - The first hurricane of this season over the Atlantic has hit land in Texas.
Life-threatening floods, strong winds and heavy rains now threatened parts of the U.S. state, the National Hurricane Center of the U.S. Climate Authority NOAA said on Sunday night.
Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for many districts.
The Texas corona pandemic is making the work of helpers more difficult, Abbott said, according to U.S. media.
Evacuees called for caution
“Every hurricane is a huge challenge,” Abbott said, according to the Houston Chronicle.
Looking at the Texas vortex, he added: “This challenge is complicated and gets even tougher when you consider that it sweeps through an area that is the most heavily affected by Covid-19 in the state.”
According to the Johns Hopkins University, about 5,000 people have died in Texas alone as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.
Abbott cautioned people who had to leave their homes.
They should not disregard practices "that we have become accustomed to", such as wearing masks, the governor said, according to CBS.
It is important that everyone keep their distance.
Therefore, hotel rooms were also provided in some places.
In addition, it should be tested on Corona in emergency accommodation.
Damage had initially only been reported from the coastal town of Port Mansfield.
Storm warning withdrawn again
With wind speeds of up to 150 kilometers per hour, "Hanna" was reportedly hit on Padre Island just off the Texas coast.
The tropical storm had previously been upgraded to hurricane of the lowest level one.
For the coastal section from Port Mansfield to Sargent, a storm surge warning had first been issued and was later withdrawn.
Authorities expected a softening, while "Hanna" continued to move inland and into northeastern Mexico.
"Douglas" moves to Hawaii
In the Pacific, Hurricane "Douglas" was heading toward Hawaii at night on Sunday with wind speeds of around 150 kilometers per hour.
The hurricane center, however, expected it to weaken further.
According to the forecast, it is supposed to be on Sunday (local time) near the largest islands of Hawaii - then as a storm just below the hurricane threshold.
Above the Atlantic, NOAA expected an above-average active hurricane season this year after a May forecast.
From June to the end of November, up to ten hurricanes are expected, of which up to six could be very strong hurricanes, the authority had declared.
On average, there are six hurricanes per year over the Atlantic, three of which develop into storms of great strength.
Given the available climate data and the higher water temperature in the Atlantic and Caribbean, the probability of a normal season is only 30 percent, compared to an below-average one even at only 10 percent, it was said at the time.
U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that his administration is closely monitoring the storms and is in contact with the affected states.
Four goals denied: Video assistant "punished" Sassuolo
Sassuolo's Filip Djuricic was denied two goals
Naples - Four goals scored, four goals dismissed: Sassuolo Calcio experienced a pitched evening at 0:2 (0:1) at the SSC Naples in the Italian football league Serie A - and was really angry at the video assistant of the referee.
"A festival not given doors for Sassuolo.
The VAR has never been so tough against a team,” commented the “Corriere dello Sport”.
Host Naples had gone through a goal by outside defender Elseid Hisaj in the 8th minute, in the 32nd minute Filip Djuricic first cheered the balance.
The Video Assistant Referee (VAR) took the hit back due to a remote position.
Five minutes later, Djuricic shot the ball back into the net - again the VAR intervened.
The goals of strikers Francesco Caputo (50th) and Domenico Berardi (61st) were also withdrawn by the referee team, according to the VAR.
In the postseason, Allan made the 2-0 finish for Naples and the bitter evening for Sassuolo perfect.
“The VAR is worse for Sassuolo than a radar trap on the road and punishes Sassuolo like no team before.
The new technology sets records,” writes the “Gazzetta dello Sport”.
FC Bayern Munich: Pavard injured
M<0xC3><0xBC>nchen (dpa) - The start into the hot preparatory phase for the Champions League began with a setback for the double winner FC Bayern.
After a short holiday and a few days of training, Hansi Flick, who has recovered "somewhat well", must already think after the first team training, how he can rebuild his successful defense after the injury of world champion Benjamin Pavard.
The Frenchman, who has to show the third most minutes behind captain Manuel Neuer and midfielder Joshua Kimmich, suffered a ligament injury at the left foot root and threatens to miss in crucial royal-class duels.
In Munich’s Schmuddelwetter, the defender broke off a training game and was driven from the pitch with a golf map.
How long the unrestricted regular player has to pause in the fight for the title is open.
A bet in the return match against FC Chelsea on August 8 is unlikely to be possible, the 24-year-old can hope for the final tournament starting in Lisbon on August 12.
The Bavarians do not want to be stopped by the bad luck from training on Sunday.
Flick mentioned in his personal triple formula the three attributes that he wants to see from his stars on the way to Portugal’s capital.
Quality, intensity and concentration are to be shown by his victorious title-collectors in the 28 days that follow, ideally, until the final game of the K<0xC3><0xB6>nigklasse on August 23.
"We have just mastered the mandatory tasks with championship and cup.
Now we have to do something special,” said Flick.
Until the Munichers can deal with the final tournament and previously a training camp in the Algarve, however, the eighth-final duty against FC Chelsea is on for the first time.
After 3-0 in the away game before the Corona break, the Londoners in the home arena should not be like in the lost "Finale dahoam" in 2012 once again become Bayern's nightmare.
“We have to go through the door first.
We want to win, create good conditions and build trust with a good game,” Flick said.
A match is scheduled for Friday against Olympique Marseille.
With a long speech, Flick had sworn his stars, who had 13 days of vacation after the double, on a one-off August.
He welcomed 31 players on the S<0xC3><0xA4>bener Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e, including the new players for the noble purchase Leroy Sané, who for the first time after his move from Manchester City met all the new colleagues on the pitch.
"Leroy has done well, like all newcomers," Flick reported.
But instead of talking about the new season, when Sané & Co. is no longer allowed to train alone, Flick preferred to talk about the current title project of the German series champion.
After days of individual and small-group training, we are now training in team strength for the Londoners, who are in contrast to the Flick ensemble in the rhythm of the game.
After that, the Munichers could expect a quarter-final against FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi, in the semi-finals Real Madrid, Manchester City or Juventus Turin are possible opponents.
A way to the final in Lisbon "is not so easy", stressed the head coach, who can rely on the services of his new assistant Miroslav Klose in training from Tuesday.
The world record goalie Klose and Flick know about so many common tournament preparations, which is especially important when it comes to the 0-to-100 match.
"Working with his current team is a pleasure," Flick said.
The "focus on winning" was an impressive feature of his team.
The tournament with nine teams was also an ambitious one on Sunday.
All of the performers were present, including the immigrant Thiago and defender David Alaba, whose stay beyond the royal-class season is not guaranteed.
Formula 1 needs a special rule to choose their world champion
Since it is not possible to drive on the required number of continents, the FIA must improvise to award the World Cup titles.
All American races have been cancelled.
The race calendar is becoming more and more concrete
The race calendar of the current Formula 1 season continues to take shape.
To the ten Grand Prix confirmed so far, three more race tracks were added during the week.
In October, the N<0xC3><0xBC>rburgring will be held in Germany and Portim<0xC3><0xA3>o, Portugal.
On November 1st, Lewis Hamilton and Co. will compete for World Championship points at the Italian traditional race track in Imola.
As a result, the 2020 race calendar comprises 13 races according to the current state.
“We are pleased that we continue to make great progress in completing our plans for the 2020 season,” said Formula 1 boss Chase Carey.
In total, 15 to 18 races will be held in the royal class of motorsport in this extraordinary season.
Formula 1 wants to finish its season in Asia.
The final race calendar will be fixed and published in the coming weeks.
Before the already officially targeted races in Bahrain and Abu Dhabi in December, according to media reports, performances could still take place in Vietnam and Malaysia at the end of November.
Regulations require races on three continents
The rules of Formula 1 require races on at least three continents for the award of the World Championship.
Even if, as currently planned, only two continents are involved, there should be a world champion.
With the help of a special rule, the FIA wants to award the titles citing "exceptional circumstances" due to the coronavirus pandemic.
The traditional start of the season in Australia in March had to be cancelled in the short term due to the on-going corona crisis.
A return to the continent this year is not an issue.
In addition, Formula 1 will not be a guest in America this year.
Rejection meets criticism in Brazil
Due to the tense corona situation, the races will not take place in Canada, the USA, Mexico and Brazil.
“We look forward to being with them again next season,” Carey said.
The rejection of the American races was especially criticized in Brazil: "The rejection did not come as a surprise to us, but we cannot accept the reasons for it," said Tamas Rohonyi, promoter of the Grand Prix in S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo.
For example, infection rates in the S<0xC3><0xA3>o Paulo area are significantly lower than in other regions of Brazil.
The concerns of some teams not to want to drive in Brazil would also not justify rejection.
Be prepared for the required security measures.
Greta Thunberg: A bad look at Donald Trump went around the world
Greta Thunberg spoke about her meeting with US President Donald Trump.
Greta Thunberg was on the well-known late-night show hosted by Stephen Colbert via video and told in an interview what she had in mind when she met Donald Trump.
Climate activist Greta Thunberg was a guest on a popular U.S. late night show via video.
Among other things, she told about her fight against the powerful of the world.
The teenager also spoke about her famous "evil look" during her meeting with Donald Trump.
New York City - Over the past two years, climate activist Greta Thunberg has made her tireless commitment to the "Fridays For Future" movement.
Now she spoke on a well-known latenight show about her plans for the future as well as her meeting with US President Donald Trump at the UN climate summit last year.
Latenight presenter Stephen Colbert welcomed 17-year-old Thunberg on your show on Tuesday and conducted a lengthy interview with the Swedish.
In doing so, she spoke not only about her fight against climate change, but also about her conflict with the world’s powerful.
“There are some things that surprised me,” she said.
“How far do people go to steer the focus away from the climate crisis,” she said.
“Everything from organized hate campaigns to threats, just because a group of kids is going out on the streets,” she said.
Heads of state and leading politicians who mock her on social media or even try to silence her, she finds it “fun” because the reactions show her “because they have no other answer to it.”
It became particularly interesting at the end of the interview when Greta Thunberg was addressed to a well-known scene in which she took a bitterly evil look at U.S. President Trump.
At the UN Climate Summit 2019 in New York, for which the actress sailed across the Atlantic, her expressive gaze was captured by the cameras and has since been seen by countless people on the Internet.
From the short clip, a GIF was created, i.e. an animated image that eventually became one of the most commonly used images for Trump opponents.
But what did the 17-year-old think of the U.S. president at the time?
To Stephen Colbert’s relatively open question, she answered only briefly and dryly: “To be honest, I don’t think that needs any further explanation.”
The experienced satirist Colbert did not expect the answer to be ready for impact and disappeared from the picture laughing briefly.
With her "How dare you?" speech on the principles of climate protection, she was remembered by many at the climate conference.
Ex-Dortmunder Three-pack property for Lazio Rome
Ciro Immobile is now in the race for Europe’s Golden Shoe on par with Bayern’s Robert Lewandowski.
The former Dortmunder Ciro Immobile still has the best chance of becoming a goalkeeper king in the Italian football championship.
The former BVB professional scored three goals in the 5:1 (1:1) victory of Lazio Roma at Hellas Verona, including two converted yards in the postseason of both halves.
This means that the 30-year-old from the fourth quarter of the season now has 34 season goals on his account - just as many scored Robert Lewandowski from FC Bayern Munich in the expired Bundesliga season.
In Italy, Cristiano Ronaldo follows with 30 goals so far, the Portuguese superstar met with the top rider in the evening on Sampdoria Genoa.
Fleetwood-Mac co-founder Peter Green dies

Blues rock guitarist Peter Green has died at the age of 73.
Genius guitarist, drug junkie, cult follower: The band’s co-founder Fleetwood Mac, Peter Green, is dead.
He died peacefully in his sleep at the age of 73, family members said in an official statement on Saturday, another statement being announced for the next few days.
Top musicians such as Peter Frampton praised Green as one of the best blues and rock guitarists.
Mick Fleetwood spoke in an emotional response of a "monumental loss" to all former and current members of the band Fleetwood Mac.
The drummer Fleetwood and the guitarist Green had founded the now long legendary band in 1967 in London, to this day his dream instrumental hit "Albatross" is unforgettable.
The life of the musician ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") was like a roller coaster ride.
With Fleetwood Mac, Green experienced a rapid rise - the band celebrated their greatest successes but then without him.
Among other things, there was a dispute because Green wanted to donate all profits to the group for charitable purposes.
He began to appear in wide robes and with a large crucifix.
Mental problems are also said to have played a role.
Three years after its founding, Green left the band in 1970.
This was followed by a social decline.
The blues rock guitarist suffered from drug abuse and schizophrenia, as biographers reported.
For a long time, Green was treated in psychiatry.
During much of the 1970s, the musician disappeared from the picture.
He is said to have lived temporarily on the street, worked as a cemetery gardener and spent some time in an Israeli kibbutz.
Green was born in 1946 to a Jewish working-class family in Bethnal Green, London.
At a young age, he was fascinated by American blues musicians such as B.B. King and Muddy Waters.
At the age of eleven, he learned the first guitar chords.
At the age of 15, the teenager began playing guitar professionally and five years later got the chance to be a lead guitarist for the instrumental band Peter B's Looners.
He later joined the Bluesbreakers as a replacement for his idol Eric Clapton.
In the middle of the blues boom, Green founded Fleetwood Mac in the summer of 1967, along with his Bluesbreakers colleagues Mick Fleetwood and John McVie.
The song "Albatross", composed by Green, gave the group their first number 1 hit in the winter of 1968/69 and catapulted them to the top of the British music scene.
But the rapid rise soon showed its shadow sides: Green did not withstand the media hype, his experiments with the drug LSD became more and more extreme.
He later commented on the life between music and addiction in an interview: "The worst thing that happened to me in life was the drugs - the best thing was to land a number 1 hit".
Towards the end of the decade, Green achieved a surprising success in 1979 with an album inspired by religious themes.
Fleetwood Mac, meanwhile, are swimming on a wave of success without him in a new formation.
Their 1977 album "Rumours" sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Despite several minor solo successes, Green did not make a major comeback until he re-started in 1996 with a group of friendly musicians.
The British Daily Telegraph at the time spoke of a rock star returning to Earth.
Free from drugs, Green released several albums with the Peter Green Splinter Group until the band disbanded in 2004.
For music experts, he was already a blues legend - and with his gentle sound one of the most influential guitarists of the past decades.
