Members of the National Assembly for Wales fear confusion with the Muppets
For some members of the National Assembly, the proposal to change their title to "MWP" (Member of the Welsh Parliament) is shocking.
The reason for this is plans to change the name of the National Assembly to "Welsh Parliament".
National Assembly members of all political directions fear becoming the target of ridicule.
A member of the National Assembly, a member of the Labour Party, said his group was concerned because the name rhymes with “Twp” and “Pwp.”
For non-Wales readers: In Welsh, "twp" stands for "doof" and "pwp" for "Aa".
A national assembly member of the Plaid Cymru party said the entire group was “not happy” and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said his group was open to the name change, but pointed to the great similarity between "MWP" and "Muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced similar to the letter u in the English spoken in Yorkshire.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting a law for the name changes, said: “The final decision on designations for the National Assembly members is, of course, up to the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act of 2017 authorized the Welsh National Assembly to change its name.
In June, the panel published the results of a public hearing on the proposals, which generated broad support for the name "Welsh Parliament" for the National Assembly.
Regarding the titles of the National Assembly members, the "Welsh Parliament Members" or "WMPs" preferred, while at a public hearing the "MWP" option found the greatest support.
The National Assembly members seem to be proposing alternative options, but fighting for a consensus for President Elin Jones, who is due to table a bill within weeks, could pose a problem.
The Reforms Act will include further changes to the workings of the National Assembly, including rules on disqualification of National Assembly members and on the design of the committee system.
Members of the National Assembly may vote on their names in the course of their debate on the law.
Macedonians vote in a referendum to change the country's name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was set up to settle a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has a province with a similar name, Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly spoken out against its accession to the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would not recognize the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's remain silent in the face of the difficulties of the churches in Harlem
“The old people I spoke to said, ‘In the past, there’s been a bar and a church on every corner,’” Adams said.
“Today, both are no more.”
He said the disappearance of the bars was understandable.
“People’s social lives today look different,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms that people regularly find themselves in.”
With the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as the church leaders assume, and that they will “sooner or later be back at the beginning.”
Churches, he added, could be replaced by apartment houses with condominiums in which people live who do not support the remaining refuges.
“The overwhelming majority of people who buy condos in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and thus speed up the complete closure of these churches, as it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these condos will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became a black metropolis: Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin's a decade later.
The original white Methodist community moved out in the 1930s.
A black community that held their worship services nearby became the owner of the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black community under Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, who refused to hire or support blacks.
In a fire in 1939, the building was heavily damaged, but when Father Johnson's community members were planning to rebuild, they commissioned the bell-play.
Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor in St. Martin's, proudly described the bell game as "the bells of the poor".
The expert who played the bell in July used other words: “a cultural treasure” and “an irreplaceable historical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first bell game played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who had switched to the larger bell game at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said he was not replaced by St. Martin's.
What has taken place in St. Martin's in recent months is a complicated story with architects and contractors drawn partly by the lay leaders of the church and partly by the diocese of bishops.
In July, the parish council – the governing body of the parish consisting of lay leaders – expressed written concerns to the diocese that the diocese would try to pass on the costs to the parish council, even though it had not been involved in the commissioning of the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
13-year-old shark injured while diving for lobster in California
In California, on Saturday, the first day of the lobster season, according to official statements, a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy while diving for lobster.
The attack took place just before 7:00 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
As Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego, he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy’s cry for help and paddled to the boy with several others to help pull him out of the water.
Hammel said he first thought the boy was glad to have caught a lobster, but then he realized that the boy was screaming “I’ve been bitten!
I've been bitten!".
When Hammel arrived at the boy, he noticed that his entire collarbone had been torn.
“I shouted that everyone should come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” Hammel added.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego and is in critical condition.
The type of shark responsible for the attack was not known.
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles told the media that a shark had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was concluded that it was not a dangerous shark species.
Giles added that the victim had suffered traumatic injuries in the upper body area.
Officials blocked the beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
According to Giles, there are over 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's to launch cosmetic market in UK
Sainsbury's attacks with department stores-like cosmetic departments, staffed with specialized assistants, boats, superdrugs, and debenhams.
As part of a large-scale push into the UK’s <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion cosmetics market, which continues to grow while fashion and household goods sales decline, the larger cosmetics departments will be tested in 11 stores nationwide, and if successful, they will expand to more stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics coincides with the search of supermarkets for ways to use store areas previously used for televisions, microwaves and household goods in other ways.
According to Sainsbury’s, the scope of its cosmetics offering for the first time doubles to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
Also existing series of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees get more space and brand areas similar to those in stores such as boats.
In addition, the supermarket is relaunching its “Boutique” makeup series, making most of the products vegan-friendly – an aspect increasingly demanded by younger customers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will be testing at two Sainsbury's stores, with the first store opening last week in Croydon, south London, and a second store opening later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the transition to daily buying of small quantities of food in local grocery stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to encourage customers to visit them.
According to Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, the outlets will increasingly look like department stores as the supermarket chain tries to fight discounters Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has set up hundreds of Argos outlets and a number of habitat outlets since the Argos and Habitat chains were purchased two years ago, increasing food sales and profitability of acquisitions.
The supermarket’s previous attempt to reorganize its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments failed.
Sainsbury's tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s, which ended after a dispute over the distribution of revenues from the drug dealer's stores in the supermarkets.
The new strategy follows Sainsbury’s sale of its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
The company said that Lloyds will play a role in the plan to add an expanded range of luxury skincare brands such as La Roche-Posay and Vichy to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Commercial Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have reshaped the look and feel of our cosmetics departments to create a more attractive environment for our customers.
In addition, we have invested in specially trained colleagues who are available as consultants.
Our range of brands is tailored to suit all needs. Due to the enticing environment and convenient locations, we are now an attractive destination for cosmetic purchases that challenges the way we shop."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby's withdrawal from <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
"Dragons' Den" star Peter Jones is "angry" after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of an 11 million pound deal with his lifestyle brand company to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for the homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The business of the two was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand.
The “This Morning” host, 37, announced her retirement on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered “Dragons’ Den” star Peter Jones by her extremely short-term withdrawal from her lucrative lifestyle brand company to focus on her own new follow-up contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones is said to have been “angry” when the TV’s “Golden Girl” admitted at a tense meeting Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that their new business – worth up to 1.5 million pounds – could no longer devote enough time to the common homewear and accessory brand.
The company was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow’s Goop brand and would have likely doubled Willoughby’s estimated fortune of 11 million pounds.
While Willoughby, 37, announced her retirement from Truly on Instagram, Jones left the UK en route to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: “Truly was by far the top priority for Holly.
It should secure for them their future over the next decades in the long term.
Their decision to withdraw came as a complete surprise to all those involved.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, so soon before the market launch.
At the headquarters in Marlow, a warehouse full of goods is waiting to be sold."
Experts believe that the withdrawal of the “This Morning” presenter, one of the UK’s most promising stars, could cost the company millions due to high investments in products from pillows and candles to clothing and homewear and possible further delays in market launch.
In addition, it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends with Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded Truly in 2016 with Capp, and Jones, 52, joined in March as chairman.
The couples spend the holiday together, and Jones holds a 40 percent stake in Baldwin’s TV production company.
Willoughby is set to become a brand ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV’s “I’m A Celebrity.”
A source close to Jones said last night: “We are not commenting on his business affairs.”
Hard words “and then we fell in love”
He joked about the criticism he expected from the news media for a comment that some would consider “non-presidential” and for such positive comments about North Korea’s leader.
Why did President Trump give up so much?
Trump said, mimicking the voice of a news moderator:
“I didn’t give up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in a second meeting, as the first meeting in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a big step towards denuclearization of North Korea.
However, denuclearisation negotiations have come to a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s top diplomat, told leading politicians from around the world at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North sees no “corresponding response” from the US to North Korea’s first disarmament measures.
Instead, he noted, the U.S. was holding on to sanctions designed to maintain pressure.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
“We are very successful with North Korea,” he said.
“We were facing a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
Now we have this great relationship.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim showed positive results: the end of missile tests, support for the release of hostages and the repatriation of the remains of American military personnel.
He also defended his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to be presidential, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside trying to get into this crowded arena, there would be about 200 people standing here,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd right in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastated an island in Indonesia, costing hundreds of lives
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign non-governmental organizations were told they would not be needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population was displaced from Lombok, no national emergency was declared, a prerequisite for the mobilization of international aid.
“Unfortunately, in many cases they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international support, so that’s a bit difficult,” Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet clear whether foreign employees can work locally.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the disaster relief agency, said Indonesian officials assessed the situation in Palu on whether international agencies were likely to participate in the relief efforts.
In the face of the earthquakes with which Indonesia is constantly struggling, the country is still woefully ill prepared for natural forces.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, these are not an everyday sight on other coastal strips.
The apparently missing tsunami warning siren in Palu has probably contributed to the deaths, despite a warning that went into effect.
Traveling between Indonesia’s numerous islands is already a challenge at best.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok for the treatment of earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but will reach the site of the new disaster in at least three days.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia’s battered infrastructure a core part of his election campaign, spending heavily on roads and railways.
However, the government of Joko, who is seeking re-election next year, is suffering from funding deficits.
Joko is also under pressure from ongoing sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority practice a more conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes as gangs of Christians and Muslims fought in the streets with machetes, arrows and bows as well as other primitive weapons.
View: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge scores a deep goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool on Saturday at London's Stamford Bridge Stadium with a goal in the 89th minute ahead of a Premier League loss to Chelsea.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri at a 0:1 setback from his team at a distance of about 27 metres from Chelsea's goal.
He aimed the ball to the left and then shot him in the direction of the back post.
The shot sailed high above the penalty area and drifted into the right upper corner of the net.
Finally, the ball fell over the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and then into the net.
“I’ve just been trying to get into this position and get to the ball, players like Shaq are always playing as much forward as possible, so I’ve just been trying to make as much time as possible for myself,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante coming and had contact with the ball. I didn't think too much about it and just took the shot."
Chelsea led in the 25th minute by Belgian star Eden Hazard at halftime with 1:0.
The Blues striker gave a pass with his heel back to Mateo, then turned off near the midfield and sprinted into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic played a quick double pass in the midfield.
He then shot a good steep pass, leaving Hazard in the penalty area.
Hazard left the defenders behind and left Liverpool's Alisson Becker behind with a left-handed shot.
Liverpool will play in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3 p.m. at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples.
Chelsea will face Chelsea in the UEFA Europa League Videoton on Thursday at 3 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the disaster relief agency said on Sunday morning.
Many people are said to have been trapped in the rubble of buildings that had been brought down by Friday’s magnitude 7.5 earthquake, which had triggered waves up to six meters high, government spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, was littered with the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest man, 32, on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed
Following the discovery of a female corpse this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, a murder investigation was launched.
The 44-year-old was found with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street at 7:55 a.m., and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging residents to report if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is at an early stage, but I ask all those who have stayed near John Street in Birkenhead and have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
In addition, I ask all persons, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken something with a Dashcam to contact us. They may have information that is of the utmost importance for our investigation."
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman whose body was found lived in Birkenhead and was found in a building.
This afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to inquire where she was found this morning.
Investigations are underway, and police said they are on the verge of informing the next of kin of the victim.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews was just trying to get into his apartment but was informed by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he found out what had happened.
Residents are now informed that it will take hours for them to re-enter the building.
It was heard that a police officer told a man that now the entire area is being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared in tears dissolved at the scene.
She kept saying, “That’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., two police vehicles were inside the lock-up and another vehicle was inside before the lock-up.
Within the lockdown, several police officers were standing guarding the block of flats.
Persons with information are asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call number 101, or contact Crimestoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111 and refer to Minutes 247 of 30 September.
The Cromwell statue in front of the parliament becomes the latest monument to be the subject of controversy over rewriting history
Their banishment would be poetic justice for his destruction of so many cultural and religious artefacts of England by his fanatical Puritan followers, reminiscent of the Taliban.
The Cromwell Society, however, described Crick's proposal as "foolishness" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate about removing statues, it was inevitable that Oliver Cromwell’s statue in front of the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
The picture storm in the English Civil Wars was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the deeds of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent portrayal of Cromwell is proof of the 19th-century opinion and part of the historical writing of a figure that many still believe is worth celebrating.
Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps at the end of the 19th century, more than today, as someone who defended parliament against pressure from the outside, in his case of course by the monarchy.
Whether this is a fully accurate representation is the subject of continued historical debate.
It is certain that the conflict in the middle of the 17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a single recognizable figure who represents one side of this divide.
His services as Lord Protector are also worth celebrating and remembering."
Killer pig bites Chinese farmers dead
According to local media reports, a farmer in a market in southwest China was attacked and killed by a pig.
The man, to whom only the surname "Yuan" was named, was found dead with a severed artery near a pig farm in the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines to pigs in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly arrived with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning his cousin found him dead and saw that a door to a neighboring pig pen was open.
He said a large male pig with blood on the muzzle had been found in the stable.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that the 250-kilogram pig had killed the farmers.
“My cousin’s legs were bloody and mutilated,” the cousin, who was nicknamed “Wu,” was quoted by Guiyang Evening News as saying.
Footage from a security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told the Evening News that the pig had been detained to prevent attacks on other people while police collected evidence at the crime scene.
Yuan’s family and market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
While it is rare for pigs to attack humans, such cases are known.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, where the man suffered serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a 290-kilogram pig stuck a Welsh farmer between itself and a tractor until the farmer’s wife could scare the animal away.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but that the taste of blood can act as a “trigger.”
“They’re just playful.
They like to squirm and are very curious, ... they are not ready to hurt anyone.
You just have to treat them with the right level of respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring widespread heavy rains to the southwest of the United States
As predicted, Hurricane Rosa weakens on the way across the colder waters on Mexico’s northern coast.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring torrential rains in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
On Sunday at 5:00 a.m. East Coast Time, Rosa had wind speeds of 136 km/h, which corresponds to a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
In the meantime, a trough begins to form over the Pacific Ocean, which moves east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa reaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm, high tropical moisture is transported north to the southwest of the United States.
Rosa will cause up to 25 centimetres of precipitation in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, in the coming days, tropical moisture will generate widespread heavy rainfall in the southwest through interactions with the approaching trough.
Locally, 2.5 to 10 centimetres of precipitation can cause dangerous flooding, drifting debris in the water, and possibly landslides in the desert.
High tropical humidity occasionally leads to precipitation rates of nearly 5 to 7.5 centimeters per hour, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
In the southwest, especially in a large part of Arizona, up to 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation is expected.
Due to the spread of tropical rainfall, there is the possibility of flood-like floods with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
In the face of the impending tropical rains, it is strongly advised not to walk into the desert.
Heavy rainfall can cause canyons to become rippling streams, and thunderstorms bring local gusts as well as wind that carries dust.
The nearby trough brings locally heavy rain to parts of the southern California coast.
Total precipitation amounts of more than one centimeter are possible, which can lead to a small amount of debris driving in the water and to smooth roads.
This would be the first rainfall of the rainy season in this region.
The first isolated tropical rain showers reach Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning. On Monday evening and Tuesday it rains widely.
On Tuesday, heavy rain spreads into the Four Corners region and continues on Wednesday.
In October, strong temperature fluctuations are possible throughout the U.S. as the Arctic cools, while the tropics remain relatively warm.
This sometimes leads to drastic temperature differences over short distances.
On Sunday there is a good example of drastic temperature differences in the middle of the USA.
Between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, as well as between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, there is a temperature difference of almost 12 oC.
Over the next few days, the ongoing summer heat is trying to re-evolve and expand.
For much of the middle and east of the U.S., a warm early October with widespread temperatures of 27°C is expected from the Southern Plains to parts of the Northeast.
New York City could reach 27oC on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecast suggests a high probability of above-average temperatures in the first half of October in the eastern United States.
Over 20 Million Viewers Have Seen Brett Kavanaugh’s Hearing
More than 20 million viewers on six television networks on Thursday saw the captivating statements of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and wife Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s.
In the meantime, the political stalemate continued, with television stations interrupting their regular programming on Friday due to a last-minute turnaround: an agreement negotiated by Jeff Flake, Arizona senator, that the FBI is to conduct a one-week investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee to be 100% sure Kavanaugh was drunk at a high school party, harassed her, and tried to remove her clothes.
Kavanaugh said in a passionate statement that he was 100% sure that this had not happened.
It is likely that more than the 20.4 million viewers reported by Nielsen have seen the hearing.
The company found the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other networks such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, which had broadcast the hearing, the numbers were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring audience numbers in offices.
To put this in perspective, this is roughly equivalent to the number of spectators at a play-off football game or at the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose opinion-oriented moderators strongly support the nomination of Kavanaugh, recorded the highest numbers of all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers of the full-day hearing, according to Nielsen.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
According to Nielsen, CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million.
Interest remained high after the hearing.
Flake was the central character in Friday’s drama.
After the moderate Republican’s office issued a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was filmed Friday morning by CNN and CBS cameras as protesters in the elevator pushed him loudly with words on the way to a Justice Committee hearing.
He stood for minutes with his eyes lowered while he was being schooled. The scene was broadcast live on CNN.
“I’m standing right here in front of you,” one woman said.
“Do you think he’s telling the truth?”
“You have power while so many women are powerless,” one woman said.
Flake said his office had released a statement and added before the elevator closed that he would have more to say at the hearing before the committee.
All cable and radio networks broadcast live hours later, when the Judiciary Committee was to vote on forwarding Kavanaugh's nomination to the entire Senate.
However, Flake said he would only do so on the condition that the FBI investigate the allegations against the candidate next week as requested by the Democratic minority.
Flake is partly convinced by interviews with a friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After an interview with Coons and then several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake’s decision was of great importance, as it was obvious that without the investigation, the Republicans would not have enough votes to confirm Kavanaugh.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations levelled against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of using Brexit for political purposes
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused critics of her plans for leaving the European Union of using Britain’s future for political purposes and undermining the nation’s interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the Conservative Party Congress in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In an interview with her on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson intensified his attack on her so-called “chequers plan” for Brexit by calling a proposal that envisages the reciprocal collection of tariffs by the UK and the EU “completely absurd”.
Deadly Shooting at Wayde Sims: Police Arrest Suspect Dyteon Simpson in Connection with Death of LSU Player
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the deadly shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player at Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained by Baton Rouge police for murder.
The agency released video footage of the fighting between Sims and Simpson, which police say Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
According to the CBS affiliate station WAFB, police secured the glasses at the scene and said that DNA was found on Simpson’s glasses.
After questioning Simpsons, police stated that he had confessed to the deadly shots on Wayde.
The lawyer reports that the bail has been set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report on Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
Police are thanking the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, the Federal Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police, and the citizens in the area for their support in the investigation leading to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked the regional enforcement agency for “their care and their pursuit of justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The 1.98 m tall winger grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne had also played for LSU basketball.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "deeply shaken" by Wayde's death and "is in shock".
“You’re always afraid of something like that,” Wade said.
Volcano spits ash on Mexico City.
Ash ejected from the volcano Popocatepetl has reached the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity in the crater had increased and 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded within 24 hours.
The Authority monitored numerous cases of rumours and shocks.
Images on social media showed thin ash layers on the windshields of cars in neighborhoods of Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed increased activity on the 72-kilometer volcano southeast of the capital since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as “Don Goyo” has been active since 1994.
Clashes between police and Catalan separatists ahead of independence vote anniversary
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between police and pro-independence protesters, and thousands took part in other demonstrations to commemorate the first anniversary of the polarising independence referendum in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists, held back by police, threw eggs at them and also threw paint powder, creating dark dust clouds in the streets normally populated by tourists.
In the course of the day, there were also handcuffs with the police, who used their batons to contain the fighting.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanted “Don’t forget, don’t forgive” while facing unionists who shouted “Long live Spain.”
As reported by the local press, fourteen people were treated for minor injuries suffered during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid saw as illegal but was celebrated by separatist Catalans, the situation in the independent region remains tense.
Voters had opted for independence by an overwhelming majority, although voter turnout was low, as secessionists largely boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to prevent the vote in violent clashes in front of the polling stations.
Pro-independence groups had camped out in the open on Friday night to prevent a demonstration for the national police.
The demonstration took place, but was forced to take a different path.
Narcissus Termes, 68, an electrician who took part with his wife in the separatist protest, said he sees the prospect that Catalonia would gain independence no longer with hope.
“Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they could choose, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite an important, albeit narrow, victory in the regional elections last December, the Catalan pro-independence parties had difficulty maintaining momentum this year. Many of their best-known leaders are either in self-imposed exile or in prison, where they were hung on to their procedures because of their role in organizing the referendum and the subsequent Una.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest in favor of police on his phone, said the conflict had been fueled by politicians on both sides.
“The situation is getting tense,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in custody since the end of last year, announced his candidacy for election to the European Parliament next year.
“Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to denounce the degradation of democratic values and the repression by the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after house was rammed by car
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after a house in Londonderry had been repeatedly rammed by a car.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m. after British summer time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building itself were damaged.
He may have also been shot in the car with a crossbow.
Menga-Treffer means 1:0 victory over Rangers for Livingston
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured the victory.
Rising Livingston FC surprised the Rangers and led to Steven Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's hit proved crucial for Gary Holt's team to equal Hibernian in the second half.
Gerrard's team will remain in the Premiership this season without a win abroad and will face the Hearts next Sunday, which are eight points behind.
Previously, the Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston can increase his winning streak in the division to six games in the meantime, meaning head coach Holt has not yet recorded a defeat since his takeover of Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses opportunities against free-spirited guests
Holt’s team should have been in the lead long before the hit, as his directness put the Rangers in front of the most diverse of problems.
Scott Robinson broke through, but slowed down in front of the goal, and then Alan Lithgow could only shoot far away after being pushed in to hit Craig Halkett's head shot past the goal.
The hosts were content to let the Rangers play in front of them as they knew they could hinder the guests in standard situations.
In this way, the decisive gate was reached.
The Rangers allowed a free-kick, and Livingston prepared a shot in which Declan Gallagher and Robinson shot Menga in the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers had dominated possession of the ball, but were unable to overcome the hosts' defence, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly remained largely uninvolved.
This pattern continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos once forced Kelly to defend.
Scott Pittman was kicked away by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow slipped the ball out of another standard situation at Livingston.
Flanks repeatedly entered Livingston's sentencing room and were regularly brought out of danger, while two required sentencing kicks – one by Halkett against incumbent Glenn Middleton and one by hand – were denied.
"Ph<0xC3><0xA4>nomenal" by Livingston – Analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal performance and a strong result for Livingston.
They were outstanding without exception and exceeded expectations in this upward trend again.
Their playing style and their team have hardly changed since their return to the top teams, but Holt deserves great praise for the way he has rocked the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was great and led an excellently organized defense, while Menga Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall held on to Trab throughout the game.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
As good as they were at times under Gerrard, they could not reach this standard.
Their last ball was insufficient – only once they were able to penetrate the host team – and that’s something like a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are in the middle of the table.
Erdogan Received with Mixed Reactions in Cologne
On Saturday (September 29th), smiling faces and blue skies prevailed when the heads of government of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which should serve to repair relations between NATO allies.
There had been disputes over issues such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey’s accession to the EU.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an then traveled to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police cited security reasons for keeping a 25,000-strong crowd from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters – many of them Kurds – also gained a hearing, condemning Erdogan’s policies as well as the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The opposing protests reflect the polarizing effect of the visitor, hailed by some German Turks as a hero and scorned by others as an autocrat.
Traffic accident in Deptford: cyclist dies in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred at about 10:15 a.m. British daylight saving time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped, and medics took care of the man, who died at the accident site.
Months before the accident, another cyclist had died in an accident with a driver's escape in Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometers from Saturday's accident.
According to the Metropolitan Police, officials were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
Roadblocks and diversions for buses are set up, and drivers were advised to avoid the area.
Long-Lartin Prison: Six Officials Injured in Riots
According to the Prison Office, six prison officials were injured in riots at a high-security men’s prison.
The riots broke out on Sunday at about 9:30 a.m. British summer time in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire and are still continuing.
Specialized “Tornado” officials were recruited to end the unrest involving eight inmates who are confined to one wing.
The officers were treated on the spot for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the Prison Service said: “Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to resolve an ongoing incident in HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and want to make it clear that the police officers will be handed over and possibly spend more time behind bars."
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including some of the country’s most dangerous offenders.
In June, it was reported that the head of the prison was treated after an attack by a prison inmate in the hospital.
In October of last year, officers were called to the prison to take action against serious riots in which the personnel were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flood-like flooding (drought areas may benefit)
It is rare for a tropical depression to reach Arizona, but that is likely to happen early next week, when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa drift across the desert-marked Southwest and carry the risk of flood-like flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada and southeast California and Utah including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to approach rain on Monday evening and head directly over Phoenix on Tuesday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have come close as a tropical storm or tropical depression Phoenix up to 320 kilometers!
Katrina (1967) was located as a hurricane within 64 kilometers of the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center forecast 5 to 10 centimeters of precipitation with occasional up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
In other areas of the desert southwest including the central rockies and the Great Basin, 2.5 to 5 centimetres are likely, and a total of up to 10 centimetres is possible.
For those who are not at risk of flood-like flooding, the rainfall associated with pink can be a blessing due to the drought in the region.
Although floods are of great concern, this rain will be partly likely to be useful, as drought is currently prevailing in the southwest.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, in just over 40 percent of Arizona, at least extreme drought occurs, the second-highest category.
First, the path of the hurricane means that Rosa will land on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
On Sunday morning, Rosa will still have hurricane strength with maximum winds of 136 kilometers per hour and is located 620 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and then the hurricane will move north at 19 kilometers per hour.
In the Pacific, the storm will hit colder waters, weakening as a result.
Therefore, Rosa is expected to hit land on Monday afternoon or evening in Mexico with the strength of a tropical storm.
Rainfall can be severe in parts of Mexico, so there is a significant risk of flooding.
“From Baja California to the northwest of the Sonora Desert, rainfall amounts of 7.5 to 15 centimetres are expected, with up to 25 centimetres being possible,” weather.com reported.
Rosa will then move north as a tropical storm across Mexico, reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression, and then move up through Arizona to southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
“The main threat associated with Rosa or her remains is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, the northwest of the Sonora Desert and the desert-influenced southwest of the United States,” the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
As a result of these precipitations, life-threatening floods and landslides are expected in the desert and in water-driven debris as well as in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Attempted Murders
Following the discovery of a 16-year-old man with stab wounds in Somerset, three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior-Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday around 4:00 a.m. British daylight saving time.
He was taken to a hospital and his condition is "stable".
According to the Avon and Somerset police, a 17-year-old, two 18-year-old and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area.
Officials asked all those who have records of the events on a mobile phone to report.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “under the commonality, the anger” of the Democrats.
“A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the unscrupulous and outrageous tactics of the Democrats,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had suffered “under the commonality, the anger” of the Democrats throughout the nomination process.
Kavanaugh said Thursday before Congress and denied the charge made by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her decades ago, when both were teenagers.
At the hearing, Ford also pleaded guilty to the charges.
The president said on Saturday that the American people had seen the brilliance, quality and courage of Kavanaugh that day.
“A vote for the confirmation of Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for the confirmation of one of the most experienced legal minds of our time, a lawyer with an outstanding record in the service of the public,” he told the crowd of his followers in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh’s nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republican voters’ participation in the midterm elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
I don’t act, but in reality I act,” he said.
“That’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump argued that the Democrats see their mission in “resisting and blocking.”
The first major procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s nomination is expected to take place in the Senate no later than Friday, a senior GOP executive told CNN.
Hundreds killed in Indonesia earthquake, death toll rises
According to authorities, at least 384 people were killed on Saturday, many of whom were washed away when huge waves hit the beaches due to a powerful earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Hundreds of people had gathered on Friday at a party on the beach in the city of Palu, when waves up to six meters high hit the beach at night, killing many people and destroying everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami was preceded by an earthquake of magnitude 7.5.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach following their activities and did not immediately run away from it, and they fell victim to it,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB, told a conference in Jakarta.
“The tsunami didn’t come alone, it swam cars, tree trunks and houses, it hit everything on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had been pulled over the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people had climbed trees on the run from the tsunami and had survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated and accommodated in 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial footage released by the disaster relief agency showed numerous destroyed buildings and shops, arched and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was shaken by further aftershocks.
The earthquake series was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian agency BPPT (Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s massive quake corresponded to 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
Due to the city’s location at the end of a long, narrow bay, the tsunami could have gotten bigger, the authority said.
Nugroho described the damage as "comprehensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
According to him, the bodies of some victims were found under the rubble of collapsed buildings. 540 people were injured, and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and damage could have been higher along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
The communication with Donggala was, according to Nugroho, completely paralyzed, and there was no information.
According to a Red Cross statement, more than 300,000 people live there, and its staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
“This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse,” the statement said.
On Saturday, the authorities were often criticized for not informing them that a tsunami had hit Palu, although the waves arrived according to official information at the time of the warning.
Amateur footage posted on social media shows a man on the upper floor of a building who is desperate for calls to warn people on the street below him of the approaching tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water bursts onto the shore and buildings and cars float away.
Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that disrupted communications around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
According to the authorities, the military has started to send cargo planes with support from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuees still urgently need food and other vital goods.
The city's airport remains closed until October and has only been reopened for relief.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
The number of tsunami victims has risen to more than 800.
The location is very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala safely reached the city of Palu, where the employees are housed in tented accommodation in the courtyard of their office, but, according to Dosebas, they passed scenes of devastation along the way.
“They said they’d seen a lot of destroyed houses,” he said.
The location is very bad.
Even when the relief groups began to set in motion disaster relief, some suggested that expert foreign helpers would be prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, financial aid, supplies and personnel from abroad are only possible when the site of an accident has been declared a national disaster area.
That hasn't happened yet.
“At the moment it is still a disaster at the provincial level,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
“As soon as the government says, ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can accept international support, but that status is not valid until now.”
As the second night since Friday’s earthquake and tsunami descended over Palu, friends and family members of those still missing hoped for one of the miracles that shed some light on the sad stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled out of a sewer.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped in rubble next to her mother’s body for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of Indonesia’s national paragliding team, had been training two of the missing paragliders for earlier this month’s Asian Games in Indonesia.
Others who were prisoners at the Roa-Roa hotel were, as Mandagi added, his students.
“As a senior in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Gendon recounted how, in the hours after the news of the Roa Roa hotel’s collapse among the paragliders, he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the contestants from Palu who were taking part in the beach party.
However, his news led instead to blue ticks only to gray question marks.
“I think that means that the messages were not delivered,” he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 while filling up a cash machine in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release of the Newport police, on Friday morning in Newport on the Levee, thieves stole an employee of Brink’s when filling a cash machine 26,750 dollars.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied an ATM in the entertainment complex and wanted to make more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the press release.
While he was busy, “a man came running after Brink’s employee” and stole a bag full of money intended for the vending machine.
According to the press release, witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not say how many people were involved in the incident.
Persons who have information about the identity of the suspects are asked to contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
In announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "The being formally known as Kanye West" (The creature officially known as Kanye West).
West, 41, has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used it as the title of his eighth album released in June.
The change precedes his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where the release of his new album “Yandhi” is expected.
He appears on the show as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the producer, canceled for "emotional reasons".
The word is not only an abbreviation of its current professional name, but it has a religious meaning for the West.
“I think ‘ye’ is the most commonly used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said in an interview this year about his album with radio host Big Boy.
“I am you, I am we, it is we.
From Kanye, which means “the only one,” only “Ye” became a reflection of our good, our bad, our confused, of everything.
The album is more about who we are.”
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy and Diddy, but this year announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, with whom West previously collaborated, has already written his name with and without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexico's AMLO vows not to use military force against civilian population
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed never to use military force against the civilian population as the 50th anniversary of bloody reprisals against students in his country approaches.
Lopez Obrador vowed on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza to “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
On October 2, 1968, soldiers fired on a peaceful demonstration on the square, killing 300 people, and at that time leftist student movements were establishing themselves throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised to support young Mexicans through monthly student grants and the opening of other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of training opportunities led to criminal gangs among young people.
U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
Given China’s increased artificial intelligence activities, the U.S. should double its spending on research in this area, says investor and AI practitioner Kai-Fu Lee, who worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments follow AI announcements from various areas of the U.S. government, even though the U.S. generally lacks a formal AI strategy.
In the meantime, China unveiled its plan last year: the country intends to become the No. 1 in the field of AI innovation by 2030.
“The doubling of the budget for AI research would be a good start, given the fact that all other countries are so far behind the U.S., and we are looking for the next AI breakthrough,” Lee said.
Doubling the funding could double the chances that the next big AI success would be achieved in the U.S., Lee said this week in an interview with CNBC.
Lee, whose book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the most prominent AI companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the highest-ranked American Othello player, later leading Microsoft Research and president of Google’s China branch.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Robotics Challenge and asked about the timing of the next competition as he wanted to help identify the next visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government subsidies.
“It’s not China that is taking away the top academics, it’s taking away the companies,” Lee said.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other technology companies have shut down coryphaes of universities that are supposed to work on AI.
In Lee’s view, a changed U.S. immigration policy could also be conducive to U.S. AI efforts.
“I think that people with a PhD in AI should automatically be offered green cards,” he said.
In July 2017, the State Council of China presented its plan for the development of the next generation of AI technologies (Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan).
According to Lee, the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds individuals at academic institutions similar to the National Science Foundation and other government organizations to fund U.S. researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which partners from industry and science are expected to participate, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
In addition, DARPA announced this month a $2 billion investment in the AI Next initiative.
The National Science Foundation (NSF) currently invests more than $100 million annually in AI research.
Meanwhile, U.S. laws regarding the formation of the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence have done nothing for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing country's name
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would settle a decades-old dispute with Greece that had blocked Macedonia's bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns a province called Macedonia, claims that the name of its northern neighbor means that this claim to Greek territory, so Greece has vetoed Macedonia's accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments signed an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia’s Slavic majority population.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum. A boycott campaign casts doubt on the fact that voter turnout reaches the 50 percent required for the validity of the referendum.
The question on the ballot was: “Are you in favour of membership in NATO and the EU by accepting the agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, to which Prime Minister Zoran Zaev belongs, argue that Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, is worth the price to include in organizations such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union, as this means a safer life for all of us,” said Olivera Georgievska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the result of the vote is not legally binding, enough MEPs have said they would stick to the result for it to be decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said there were no reports of irregularities until 1 p.m.
However, voter turnout was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary elections in 2016, in which 66 percent of registered voters cast their votes.
“I am here because of my children to vote, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko will vote in a referendum in Strumica, Macedonia on September 30, 2018 to change the country’s name, which would open Macedonia to joining NATO and the European Union.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and presented chairs in front of tents set up by people who wanted to boycott the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to join raised heads, not through the back door,” Kavadarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don’t want to take us as Macedonia, we can turn to others like China and Russia and become part of the integration between Europe and Asia.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will result in much-needed investment for Macedonia, whose unemployment rate is more than 20 percent.
"I believe that a large majority will be in favour of this, as more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after his vote.
In his words, a “yes” result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is below the required voter turnout.
Another survey conducted by Macedonian broadcaster Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents plan to vote on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, the voter turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
A failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to pro-Western government policy since its takeover in May last year.
View: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City maneuvers through all Brighton defence to score goal
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the Brighton defence at Etihad Stadium in Manchester on Saturday in a 2-0 win over Manchester City.
Aguero made his hit in the 65th minute look ridiculously simple.
At the beginning of the sequence, the Argentine attacker received a pass in the midfield.
He raced between three Brighton defenders and then ran into the open field.
Aguero then saw himself surrounded by four green jerseys.
He played around a defender and then overtook several more defenders on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
He then shot a pass to the left of Sterling.
The English striker used his first ball contact in the penalty area to play the ball back to Aguero, who overcame Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with his right shoe and shot into the right side of the net.
“Aguero is struggling with problems at his feet,” City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We were talking about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment."
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage in the Premier League duel.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball on this move far to the side of Brighton.
He shot a good steep pass along the left flank of Leroy Sané.
Sané needed a few trains to steer Sterling to the long corner.
The Sky Blues attacker targeted the ball into the net just before it slipped into the net.
City will play in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim against Hoffenheim.
Scherzer wants to ruin the game for the Rockies
As the Nationals dropped out of the playoff competition, there was little reason to force another bet.
However, the always-outstanding joker hopes to stand on the hill against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if this is relevant for the Rockies, who have a game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West, for the playoffs.
The Rockies scored at least one wildcard with a 5:2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but still want to secure their first division title.
“Although we don’t play for anything, we can at least throw because we know the atmosphere in the audience here in Denver and the other team would probably play at the highest level that I would encounter this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to participate in this competition?”
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but are reportedly inclined to let jokers throw in such a situation.
Scherzer, for whom this would be the 34th bet as a starting player, practiced in the Bullpen on Thursday and would throw on his normal rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander has 18-7 statistics this season, an ERA of 2.53 and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump to hold rally in West Virginia
The president referred indirectly to the situation surrounding his choice of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court when he spoke about the importance of Republican voter participation in the midterm elections.
“Everything we’ve done is at stake in November.
Five weeks before one of the most important elections of our lives.
That’s one of the big, big ones – I don’t step in, but in reality I step in, that’s why I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates,” he said.
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible radical group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power by all means, they see the meanness, the abhorrence.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to overrun to get power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give them that."
The Democrats, he said, saw their mission as “to resist and block.”
“And you’ve seen that in the last four days,” he said, describing the Democrats as “angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest.”
He specifically named the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein, which sparked loud cheers among the public.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you send the document to the outside?
Uh, uh, what.
No, no, I’m waiting for one – that was a really bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
Labour no longer holds all opinions.
The party is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to blame me, this came as little surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs to be told they are not welcome – just because we say our opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she had risen vigorously against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized with the charge that I was of a different opinion than Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically on similar issues, about which Jeremy disagreed with former top politicians.
The announcement of the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said that "the meetings should involve everyone and be productive".
Most of the Friday evening GC sessions in my eight years as a local Labour MP were exactly that.
Unfortunately, most meetings today are not marked by this tone, and the promised “kinder, more cautious” policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun.
It is becoming increasingly clear that dissenting views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and that any opinion is judged on whether it is accepted by the party leadership.
This began shortly after Jeremy became party leader; colleagues with whom I had previously believed to share similar political views were now expecting me to take a turn and take positions I would otherwise never have agreed with – be it in terms of national security or the European single market.
Whenever I speak publicly – whatever I say, it doesn’t matter – there’s a smear campaign on social media that calls for my election, denounces the political center, and says I shouldn’t be a member of the Labour Party.
And with this experience, I am not alone.
In fact, I know that I am doing better than some of my colleagues, as the comments directed at me are mostly political in nature.
I admire the professionalism and determination of colleagues who face a flood of sexist or racist insults on a daily basis, yet never give a damn.
One of the most disappointing aspects of this political era is that insults have become normal.
Jeremy Corbyn called last week for the Labour Party to promote a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we no longer allow all opinions to apply, and with every motion of no confidence and every change in the electoral rules, the party becomes more narrow.
I have often been advised in the last two years to turn my head and not express my opinion so clearly. Then I would “have no problems”.
But I did not go into politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, prompted by the neglect of the Thatcher government, which literally broke up my classroom in the overall school, I have fought for better public services for those who need them most – as a councillor as well as a cabinet minister.
I have never made a dent in my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be in any way unclear about my political positions and about areas in which I disagree with the current leadership.
To the supporters of Friday’s request, I would just like to say this: Given the fact that the country is heading for a Brexit that will harm households, businesses and our public service, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leadership of the Labour Party.
In fact, however, I am not sending this message to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that so many more electoral threats or political expediency will not deter me from acting in my opinion in the best interests of all of you.

Ayr vs Melrose 38:17: Unbeaten Ayr team climbs to the top
Two late attempts may have slightly distorted the end result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved the win in this extremely entertaining game of the day in Tennent's Premiership.
They are now the only one of the ten teams unbeaten at the top of the table.
In the end, the success of the home team was due to their superior defense as well as their better chance utilization, and coach Peter Murchie had every reason to be satisfied.
“We’ve been put to the test in our games so far, and we’re still unbeaten, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, “Congratulations to Ayr, they’ve made better use of their chances than we have.”
Grant Anderson's attempt in the 14th minute, which was increased by Frazier Climo, led Ayr. However, due to a yellow card for Scottish captain Rory Hughes, who had been released for the game by the Warriors, Melrose was able to let the numbers speak, and Jason Baggot began a non-increased attempt.
Climo built up Ayr's lead with a penalty kick before scoring a straight half-time hit and then scoring an increased try in the singles, so it stood for Ayr at break 17:5.
Melrose started the second half well, however, and Patrick Anderson's attempt, which was increased by Baggot, reduced the distance to five points.
After a long break due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off the field, Ayr built up his lead by an attempt by Stafford McDowall, who was promoted by Climo.
Then acting as captain of Ayr, Blair Macpherson received a yellow card, and again, at the end of a phase of enormous pressure, Melrose had the additional man paid by a non-increased attempt by Bruce Colvine.
However, the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for tackle without a ball against Climo, MacPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty shootout behind the advancing Ayr pack.
Climo increased as he had almost since the break, after Kyle Rowe had intercepted David Armstrong's boxkick and sent flanker Gregor Henry off for the fifth try of the home team.
"Still Game" star seems ready for new career in gastronomy
“Still Game” star Ford Kieran appears to be ready for a shift to the hospitality industry after it turns out he was named CEO of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, whose scripts he writes and in which he plays one of the main roles together with his long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The two have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last of the show, and Kiernan seems to be planning a life after Craiglang.
According to official records, he is the Managing Director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, though a source from the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was interested in joining Glasgow's "flourishing restaurant business".
“The sea belongs to us”: Bolivia, which is enclosed by land, hopes that a court will open the way to the Pacific
Sailors patrol in front of the naval headquarters in La Paz, decorated with Tauwerk.
There is a blue flag on public buildings.
Fleet bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon carry the motto: “The sea is our rightful property.
To win it back is a duty."
Everywhere in landlocked Bolivia, the memory of a bloody conflict over resources lost to Chile in the 19th century is as vivid as the desire to travel across the Pacific again.
These hopes may not be as strong as they have been for decades, as Bolivia waits for a judgment from the International Court of Justice to be delivered on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
“Bolivia has the momentum, a spirit of unity and serenity and naturally expects the result with a positive attitude,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Throughout the country, many Bolivians will follow the IGH’s verdict on big screens, hoping that the court in The Hague will decide in favor of Bolivia’s demand, according to which Chile, after decades of sporadic talks, is obliged to negotiate Bolivia’s sovereign access to the sea.
For Evo Morales, Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president, who is facing a controversial re-election battle next year, there is also a lot at stake in Monday’s ruling.
“We are about to return to the Pacific,” he vowed at the end of August.
However, some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia, and believe that this would also change little.
The UN body based in the Netherlands is not authorized to assign Chilean territory, and has determined that it will not decide on the outcome of possible talks.
According to Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law, that the IGH’s ruling already exists six months after the final plea, concludes that the case was “not complicated”.
Far from supporting Bolivia’s case, the past four years could also be a setback.
“The current Bolivian government has taken up the issue of access to the sea,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
She suggested that Morales's warlike rhetoric suffocated any remaining good will of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue their talks at some point, but after these events this will be extremely difficult.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the view that the court’s decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia has “an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance to “end the 139-year-long disputes for mutual benefit,” he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of Latin America’s most popular presidents – uses the theme of the sea as a political crutch.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific,” he added.
“Judgment is a chance to realize that we have to overcome the past.”
North Korea Says Nuclear Disarmament Only Occurs If It Can Trust the U.S.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday before the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to implement the promises made during a summit between the heads of state of the rivals in Singapore.
His remarks come at a time when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be on the verge of resuming the stalled nuclear diplomacy more than three months after the summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri called the notion that further sanctions and U.S. resistance to a declaration to end the Korean War would ever bring the North to its knees as a “brain-snake.”
Washington is sceptical and does not want to agree to the declaration without Pyongyang first taking substantial steps to disarm.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about renouncing an arsenal in which the country probably sees the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris show the latest collections for huge headwear that will soon be available in the shopping streets near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely shield the sun, you no longer need to look.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne showed off a range of crazy oversized headwear for their 2019 summer collection on the runway, which fascinated the fashion world at Paris Fashion Week.
Extremely impractical hats have flooded Instagram this summer, and these designers have sent their eye-catching creations across the catwalk.
The most outstanding piece of Valentino was an extravagant beige hat with a spring-like wide edge that pushed the heads of the models straight.
Other oversized accessories included jewel-lined watermelons, a magic hat and even a pineapple, but these are not meant to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a series of bizarre masks – just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks were fitted with stitched lips and had more resemblance to Hannibal Lecter than to Haute Couture.
One creation resembled diving gear, including snorkeling and diving goggles, while another looked like a melted ice bag.
And if you want to put another huge fashion statement, you’re in luck.
Fashion observers predict that the huge head coverings could find their way into shopping streets near you.
The oversized hats follow directly to “La Bomba”, the 60-centimeter-wide straw hat worn by Rihanna and Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the extremely impractical hat that hit big waves on social media sent another great creation across the catwalk: a straw beach bag that was almost as big as the model wearing a swimsuit that held the bag.
The bast bag in reddish orange with bast fringes and a white leather handle was at the Paris Fashion Week the outstanding piece of Jacquemus' summer 2019 collection "La Riviera".
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags will be available in the shopping streets for next summer, and the designer has generated so much excitement that the demand for oversized accessories will be hard to ignore.”
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Scotland’s independent schools continue to be distinguished by academic excellence, which continued in 2018 with further outstanding exam results and is only underpinned by individual and joint successes in the fields of sport, art, music and other community-based ventures.
With more than 30,000 students from across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the highest level of care to their students and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further education and higher education, the profession of their choice and their place as world citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a tailor-made curriculum, we see that modern languages are still popular and sought after in schools as electives.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to someone in a language they understand, you reach their head.
If you speak to him in his own language, you will reach his heart.”
This is an impressive reminder that we can’t just rely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
The current exam results of this year show that languages with the highest survival rates are at the top of the rankings of independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of the students who learned foreign languages achieved the grade A in the higher examinations.
The data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin scored A in the higher exams, while 72 percent of students who learned German, 69 percent of students who learned French, and 63 percent of students who learned Spanish also scored No.
This illustrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important knowledge that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages are now regarded as elective subjects as are STEM subjects (natural sciences, engineering, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere.
According to a 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, 17 per cent of the reasons employers cited for problems with hiring were related to a lack of language skills.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly imperative when it comes to preparing young people for their future profession.
As more and more open positions require languages, this knowledge is essential in a globalised world.
Regardless of the chosen profession, young people who have learned a second language will have a real advantage in the future through such a lifelong ability.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give multilingual people a head start over competitors.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 percent could not speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, and French was spoken as the only language with a double-digit percentage (15 percent).
For this reason, it is important for the children of today that we now invest in language lessons.
Children who speak multiple languages, especially languages of developing countries, will have better chances of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, different languages are taught in all schools.
A number of schools will focus on the more classical modern languages, while other languages will be taught that are considered most important for the UK with a view to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Wherever your child’s interests lie, independent schools will always have a range of languages to choose from with appropriately specialized teachers.
Scottish independent schools are committed to creating a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills necessary for their success, whatever the future may look like.
At this point in a global economic environment, it cannot be denied that languages are still of elementary importance for the future of the country, which is why this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should actually be regarded as “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
It has to be done.
John Edward is head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron to make Lakers debut Sunday in San Diego
For fans who want to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday in the opening game of the preseason against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, how many minutes he will play is not yet known.
“It’s going to be more than one and less than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play only a few minutes.
Earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
“I don’t need pre-season games at this stage of my career to prepare,” he said.
Time for Trump's rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of Trump’s five rallies planned for next week, including in places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
In light of the pending vote to confirm his election to the Supreme Court, Trump wants to build support for the upcoming midterm elections in November as Republicans run the risk of losing control of Congress.
When will Trump’s rally in West Virginia take place tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s rally in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for today, Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m.
You can follow Trump’s rally in West Virginia below as a livestream on YouTube online.
Trump is likely to address Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh’s hearings on sexual misconduct allegations that were conducted in a tense atmosphere this week, with the expected Senate vote on the confirmation remaining in the fray for up to a week while the FBI conducts investigations.
However, the main goal of this series of rallies is to support Republicans who face a difficult election in November.
Therefore, President Trump’s campaign team told Reuters that these five rallies next week serve to “mobilize volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and expand their majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
“Control of Congress is so important to his plans that the president will travel to as many states as possible as the campaign season approaches,” a Trump campaign spokesman who declined to name his name told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, supporters from “Ohio and Pennsylvania could attend the rally planned for tonight at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling and report to the Pittsburgh media.”
Saturday’s visit is Trump’s second visit this month to West Virginia, the state he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to support West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who has been polled in recent years.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come in to try to give him momentum in the polls,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: U.S. Team Shows Willingness to Fight to Maintain Hope for the Individual on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds on Saturday afternoon, the four games may have been exactly what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a pure invention as a sports concept, but one that players really believe in, especially in competitions like this one.
Where do you think the momentum is now?
“They were in the lead with six points, and now it’s four, so I think that means a little momentum for us,” Spieth said as he left the venue.
Europe, of course, has an advantage and is four points ahead, while twelve more will follow.
The Americans, however, feel some wind in their sails and have reason to feel encouraged, not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have been playing together all day and can score three out of four points each.
Spieth was incredibly strong from the tee to the green and sets a good example.
The guttural screams of enthusiasm became louder as he sank an important putt to decide the fourth match with four points for both of them, after he and Thomas had lagged behind after two holes with two points.
His putt, which decided the match on the 15th hole for her, triggered a similar cry, which suggests that the American team is not out of the game yet.
“I really need to get in and take care of my own game,” Spieth said.
This is all that remains for the players.
18 holes to set a sign.
Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood are the only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days and thus undoubtedly wrote the history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe’s unequal but sympathetic duo is four out of four points and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" wasn't the only couple who didn't hit a Bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they had avoided Bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and at the back nine holes on Friday morning.
This series, and the seemingly flowing energy between them and the out-of-control crowd, underline that they are the players to beat on Sunday. Fleetwood and Molinari would be the most popular players to seal a possible European victory at sunset over Le Golf National.
Preferably both at different holes at the same time.
To speak of European fame, however, would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a brief trial with Sergio Garcia, the morning’s four-time hero who played alongside Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the front nine holes brought the Spaniard and the Swedes into a clamp that they could not nearly overcome.
On Sunday, however, no one can help them out of the clutch.
The fours and fours pairings are so fascinating to watch closely due to the interactions between the couples, the advice they give or don’t give, and the way a strategy can change so quickly.
The Europeans have so far played better as a team and are clearly in the lead on the last day, but this fourth round has also shown that the team of the USA is ready for battle, which some, especially in the USA, had doubted.
Europe takes the lead on the last day of the Ryder Cup with 10:6
Europe is ahead of the USA by 10:6 after Saturday’s fours and fours and takes a solid lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup.
The brilliantly playing duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari went ahead with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods and were able to score four points in Le Golf National.
The European team led by Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, who wants to win back the trophy lost in Hazeltine two years ago, dominated in the fours in the morning against the mistakenly playing American team and won the series 3–1.
In the four games, the U.S. faced more resistance and won two matches, but were unable to catch up.
Jim Fury's team needed eight points in the twelve individual games played on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood was the first European newcomer to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were christened Molliwood after a sensational weekend, only won four points as the second duo in the history of the Ryder Cup in their four opening matches.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the fours, they harmonized excellently and beat the enchanted Woods and the American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau with an even more assertive 5&4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two matches on Saturday, occasionally flashed his brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fours and fours and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who had rested during the four in the morning, returned and played the four games as a partner of Henrik Stenson, winning 2&1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, the number one and third in the world.
For Europe, however, on this pleasant windy day south-west of Paris, not everything went according to their ideas.
The three-time major winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the bar for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They scored a tough 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours and beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fours 4&3 after losing the first two holes.
In the history of the Ryder Cup, it has only happened twice that a team came back after going into the singles with a margin of four points, but as the title holder for Furyk's team, a draw is enough to keep the trophy.
After only being in second place for two days, it doesn’t look like they could launch a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea Rejects Unilateral Disarmament Without Confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen its mistrust of the United States, and under those circumstances the country would in no way unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the World Organization’s annual General Assembly that North Korea had taken “substantial measures of good will” last year, for example by stopping nuclear and missile tests, demolishing the nuclear test site and committing itself not to increase nuclear weapons and technologies.
“We don’t see a response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and under these circumstances we will not unilaterally disarm first.”
While Ri repeated familiar North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “phased” approach to denuclearization, in which North Korea would be rewarded for successive steps, his statement seemed significant in so far as it had not initially rejected a unilateral denuclearization, as Pyeongja said.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader on June 12 in Singapore, in which Kim had assured to work toward the “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump added guarantees for North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, while the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
In addition, Washington opposes demands for a easing of strict international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘first denuclearization’ and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve its goal through coercion, and is even against the ‘explanation of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The assumption that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a brain tease of people who don’t know anything about us.
The problem, however, is that the continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri did not go into plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. head of state had highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean head of state Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were the other party in the denuclearization question instead of the US, it would not have come to this standstill in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.”
Nevertheless, the tone of Ris’ speech differed enormously from his speech last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the US mainland with North Korea’s missiles after “evil President” Trump called Kim a “missile man” on a suicide mission.
This year, Trump, who had threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea last year, heaped praise on Kim at the United Nations for his courage in terms of disarmament steps, but said there was still much work to be done and the sanctions would have to remain in place until North Korea’s denuclearization.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for it: “Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: “The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must definitely be vigorously continued until we have achieved complete, final and verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to financially dry up Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then said he would revisit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not successful.
In July, on his departure from Pyongyang, he said progress had been made on being accused by North Korea just hours later of making “gangster-like demands.”
North Korea vowed at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile base and a nuclear complex if the United States took “appropriate action.”
He said Kim had told him that the “appropriate measures” he intended were security guarantees Trump had given in Singapore, as well as steps to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn in one course to get enough sleep
A new course at Harvard University ensures that all students get more sleep this year in elementary school. This is a measure against the expanding macho culture of staying awake with caffeine and learning all night long.
One scientist has found that students at the world’s leading university are often unnecessary when it comes to paying attention to themselves.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, and is in his opinion the first such course in the United States.
He was inspired to bring the course to life after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
“In the end, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I only learning about this now, in my last year?’
According to her, no one had ever told her how important sleep is, which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
This year’s course for the first time explained to students how the basics of good sleep habits contribute to academic and sports performance and also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said the university chose to introduce the course after finding that students suffered from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one section, students see the image of a room in a residential home and click on coffee cups, curtains, exercise shoes, and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the effects of sleep deprivation on athletic performance, and the importance of a sleep routine.
In another section, participants learn that long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.
Then, using a map of the university campus with interactive symbols, they are encouraged to think about their daily routine.
“We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately.
But we believe they have the right to know this – just as you have the right to know how the decision to smoke affects your health,” added Professor Czeisler.
The pride of pushing a “night shift” is still widespread, he said, adding that modern technologies and the ever-increasing pressure on students make sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Ensuring enough sleep should be the “secret weapon” of all students against stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said, as well as avoiding weight gain as sleep deprivation puts the brain into starvation mode so that they are constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old student from California studying chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler to design the course. He had taken one of his courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to push for a university-wide course.
He hopes that in the next step, all postgraduate students will be asked to complete a similar degree program before embarking on their studies at the competitive university.
According to Professor Czeisler’s recommendation, students should set an alarm clock for sleep time and wake-up time and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emanating from electronic screens and LED lighting, which can disrupt the circadian rhythm.
Livingston vs Rangers 1:0: Menga goal defeats Gerrards player
The Rangers lost another away game when Dolly Menga's score for Steven Gerrard's unequal playing team meant a 0–1 defeat at Livingston.
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first away win since the 4:1 triumph at St. Johnstone, but Gary Holt's team added Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his team eight points behind the Ladbrokes Premiership leading Hearts by distance.
Menga met seven minutes before halftime, and the inspirational rangers seemed to have no chance of balancing.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston rises to third place and is only behind Hibernian in the goal difference.
The Rangers are also threatened with further trouble after line judge Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound by an object apparently thrown out of the guest block.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that overtook Ayr and reached the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stayed with the same 11 Livingston players who lost a point to the Hearts last week, and would have to be thrilled with how his well-trained team kept their opponent under pressure.
The Rangers dominated the ball possession, but Livingston scored more if they had the ball.
They were supposed to score a goal after just two minutes, when Menga's first pass led Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his chance and shot next to it.
Then a long free-kick from Keaghan Jacobs reached Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only pass at the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but their game seemed more hopeful in the last third than convincing.
Alfredo Morelos apparently felt that he should have received a penalty kick after a quarter of an hour due to a collision between him and Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson did not allow the Colombian's complaints to apply.
The Rangers scored only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly had little trouble with Lassana Coulibaly's headball and a soft shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livingston’s score in the 34th minute may not match the course of the game, there’s no denying that they deserved him for their hard work alone.
Again, the Rangers were unable to deal with a long-shot ball from Jacobs in a standard situation.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher shot the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept quiet and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent at half-time, and the move took effect almost immediately when winger Morelos put him in position, but the impressive Kelly rushed off his line to block the ball.
Livingston, however, continued to get the guests to play exactly the game that was theirs, with Lithgow and Halkett receiving one long ball after another.
Holt's team could have expanded their lead in the final phase, but McGregor held up well and fended off Jacobs before Lithgow kicked a header from the corner.
Rangers exchange player Glenn Middleton also called for a late penalty kick after a crowd with Jacobs, but Thomson looked away again.
Almanach: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: On September 30, 1882, today 136 years ago, the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger counter.
The Geiger counter, which has since become the standard element of science, has also become a standard element of pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado" with the seemingly unusual cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: “What in the world is that?”
Rogers: “This is a geiger counter that is used to search for radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put these headphones on, you can hear the effects of the radioactive radiation in the minerals."
Evans: "Actually, I hear a knock!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
The invention that bears his name, however, lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Degenerate Cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “see” and destroy degenerate cells.
The vaccine helps the immune system to detect deformed cells as part of treatment.
In the method, a patient is removed immune cells that are changed in the laboratory.
These cells can “see” a lot of cancers common protein and are then re-injected.
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
The ovarian cancer of a woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to detect deformed cells disappeared for more than 18 months.
The method removes immune cells from a patient, which are modified in the laboratory in such a way that they can “see” the many cancers common protein HER2 and then re-inject the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our findings suggest that we have a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “promotes the growth of various types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and bowel cancer, as Professor Berzofsky explained.
A similar method in which patients are removed from immune cells and taught to attack cancer cells has helped treat a type of leukemia.
Kanye West launched a pro-Trump tirade after his appearance on SNL, wearing a MAGA cap (“Make America Great Again”).
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was tapped in the studio at Saturday Night Live after praising far-flung US President Donald Trump and saying he wanted to run for president in 2020.
After singing his third title of the evening, “Ghost Town,” wearing a Make-America-Great-Again cap, he continued with a mock canon against the Democrats, once again emphasizing his support for Trump.
“I’ve been asked so many times by white people, ‘How can you like Trump?’
So if I were to worry about racism, I would have left America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch with Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on the allegations of sexual harassment made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the recording of West's "Schmipptirade" was not broadcast, it was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It’s not clear if Rock wanted to make fun of West’s release.
In addition, West complained to the audience that he had had difficulties behind the stage due to his head covering.
“They harassed me behind the scenes.
They said, ‘Don’t go out with the cap.’
They've been harassing me!
And then they say I was in a sunken area,” he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continues, “Do you want to see the sunken area?” He said, “I’m going to put on my Supermancape, because that means you can’t tell me what to do. You want it to move forward with the world?
Try it with love.”
His remarks triggered at least two outbursts from the audience, and SNL contributors seemed embarrassed, Variety reported. One person told the magazine: “It was dead quiet in the studio.”
West was later hired as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a performance of the title “I Love It” in which he was dressed as a perrier bottle.
West received support from Candace Turner, the head of the conservative TPUSA group, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest spirits: THANK YOU FOR REPRESENTING THE MASS HARD.”
However, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply himself and that was absolutely wonderful.
“But I don’t want to reward someone who, in my opinion, makes an ideology that is harmful to my community and gives of itself (by buying his music or his clothes or supporting his ‘art’).
He's free.
The same goes for us,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper had announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and was now "The being formally known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name, and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His rapper colleague Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion, and of course Prince, the late music legend, changed his name to a symbol and then to "The Artist Formerly Known As Prince".
Charged with attempted murder in connection with stabbing at Belfast Restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a knife-wielding man was injured in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is scheduled to appear before the Belfast Court of Arbitration on Monday.
The allegations are being investigated by the prosecutor’s office.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington attacks toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as the sword-wielding Jon Snow in HBO’s violent medieval fantasy series “Game of Thrones.”
However, the 31-year-old actor has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that such roles on the screen would result in boys often feeling that they have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Harington said he believed something had gone wrong and asked how the problem of toxic masculinity could be solved in the #MeToo era.
Harington, who recently married Rose Leslie, 31, who also starred in Game of Thrones, admitted that solving the problem was "very important" to him.
“I personally find the question of what went wrong with masculinity very important at the moment,” he said.
“What have we taught growing men with regard to the problem we are now observing?”
Harington believes that because of the very masculine characters, television may be partly responsible for the increasing toxic masculinity.
He continued: “What is innate, and what is learned?
What is taught on television and on the street that gives the boy the feeling of having to embody this particular side of a man?
I think that’s really one of the big questions of our time: how do we change that?
“For the young men, clearly something went wrong.”
In addition, he admitted in the interview that after the end of the series next summer, he would not participate in prequels or sequels of "Game of Thrones", having "enough of battlefields and horses".
As of November, Harington will be seen in a new edition of Sam Shepard’s “True West,” the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that for him the best thing about “Game of Thrones” was that he had met his wife Rose.
“I met my wife on this show, so that’s how I’ve preserved my future family and my life from now on,” he said.
Rose Leslie starred in the Emmy-winning fantasy series Ygritte, the lover of Harington's character Jon Snow.
The two married in June 2018 on Leslie’s family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14% increase in the number of citizens living with HIV or AIDS.
According to health officials, more than 820,000 people are affected in the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
In contrast to the past, the transmission took place in the vast majority of new cases through sexual intercourse.
So far, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, year-on-year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS has increased by 100,000 in China.
Sexual transmission of HIV is an acute problem in China’s LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against members of the LGBT community is widely reported.
Due to the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the disease transmissions are due to insufficient protection during sexual intercourse in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised, among other things, universal access to HIV drugs to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that employees leaked GOP senators’ data, criticizes “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
Maxine Waters, a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, denied on Saturday allegations that a member of her staff had published the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat expressed the view that the allegations would be disseminated by “ultra-right” experts and websites.
“Lies, lies and even more heinous lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The release includes the private addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday, and was released during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct by an unknown person in the government district against Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The announcement came after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the posts was assigned to Waters’ office, and published the information of a member of Waters’ staff, The Hill reported.
“This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
“The member of my staff – whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for leaking this information.
This unsubstantiated accusation is completely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters’ statement quickly sparked online criticism, including that of Ari Fleischer, a former White House press secretary.
“This denial is angry,” Fleischer wrote.
“This suggests that she doesn’t have the right temperament to be a member of Congress.
People who are accused of something they didn’t do shouldn’t be angry.
You must not be defiant.
You must not question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to be calm and relaxed.”
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters’ reaction to the Democrats’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of acting too angry during Thursday’s hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate running in the midterm elections to replace Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
“Great thing, if that’s true,” he tweeted.
Waters said in her statement that her office had informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about these fraudulent allegations.
“We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to all members of my staff.”
“Johnny English – You only live three times” – weak spying parody with Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition to look for Brexit references in every new British-coloured film, and this seems to be the case for this revival of the action comedy parody franchise “Johnny English”, which started in 2003 with “Johnny English – The Spy Who Screened It”, and in 2011 with “Johnny English – Stand Up Straight”.
Will an ironic self-parody on the issue of how obviously we are befuddled become a new export opportunity for the nation?
In any case, the license of the glitzy, grimy and incompetent Johnny English to masseuse has been extended for the second time. His name signals more than anything else that it is a general comic creation for cinema visitors in the non-English-speaking area.
Of course, he is again the clumsy secret agent who bizarrely considers himself cool and worldly, while in reality he has contributed from something Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and a bang of this guy, who has a single note to the title melody of “The Hour of the Winner” at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
In addition, the character was originally based on the chaos left behind by travelers and international secret agents that Atkinson played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television commercials.
The last adventure of Johnny English has one or two nice moments.
I liked the way Johnny English approached a helicopter in a medieval armor and the rotor blades tugged briefly at his helmet.
Atkinson’s prowess in physical comedy is apparent, but the humor seems rather weak and strangely superfluous, especially since the “serious” film series such as “007” and “Mission Impossible” now offer self-assured comedic elements.
The humor seems to be more directed at children than adults, and for me Johnny English’s crazy mishaps aren’t as imaginative and focused as Atkinson’s silent film gags in the role of the Bean.
The ever-present premise is now that Britain is in great danger.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the super-secret British spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents in the operation, much to the disapproval of the serving agent, a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last straw for the Prime Minister, an inflated and distressed figure who is already facing a complete collapse due to her political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is giving her best with this quasi-Teresa May character, but the script does not give much to work with
Her secret service advisers inform her that all active spies have been exposed and she must therefore get someone out of retirement.
This includes the Tolpatish Johnny English himself, who now works as a teacher at a fancy institution, but unofficially teaches in working as an undercover agent. There are a few gags, because English offers a spy academy reminiscent of "School of Rock".
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and reunited with his former hard-tested buddy Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married to a submarine commander, a nervous woman of the higher society, in whose role Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who are always making terrible mistakes in the secret service of your Majesty, are back in action, meeting Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is dangerously enthralled by a charismatic tech billionaire, Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy, who claims to be able to solve Britain’s computer problems.
English and Bough begin their odyssey of grotesque dishes: as waiters disguised, they set fire to a chic French restaurant, wreak havoc as they smuggle themselves aboard Volta’s luxury yacht, and English unleashes sheer anarchy as he tries to turn himself into a virtual reality insider with the help of a virtual reality headset.
In this last sequence, all the registers are drawn, but as sympathetic and funny as it is, the topic is already dealt with in detail on children's television.
Quite a moderate fabric.
As with the other Johnny English films, I had to ask myself, “Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really suits his talent?”
Labour refuses to work on a plan whereby the British work four days a week but are to be paid for five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is to consider a radical plan that provides for the British to work four days a week but be paid for five days.
According to reports, business leaders want to pass on the savings achieved by the AI revolution (artificial intelligence) in the form of an additional day off to employees.
The employees would have a three-day weekend, but would still receive the same pay.
According to sources, the idea "fits" with the economic agenda of the party and its plans to shift the balance in the country in favor of the workers.
The shift to a four-day week was advocated by the Trades Union Congress as an opportunity for workers to reap the benefits of the changing economy.
A senior Labour party source told the Sunday Times: “A policy review is expected before the end of the year.
“A shift will not occur overnight, but a four-day work week is an effort that is consistent with the party’s approach to restoring economic balance in favor of workers as well as the party’s overall industrial policy strategy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support such an idea. Already the Green Party promised the introduction of a 4-day week during the general election campaign in 2017.
However, the approach is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour Party spokesman said: “A four-day week is not party policy and is not considered by the party.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell made his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy more concrete at the Labour Conference last week.
McDonnell said he was firmly committed to reclaiming power from “anonymous directors” and “profit makers” at public utilities.
The Shadow Chancellor’s plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water utilities may not get their full share back, as a Labour government could make “withdrawals” due to alleged misconduct.
He also confirmed the corresponding plans to appoint employees to the boards of companies and set up Inclusive Ownership Funds to hand over 10% of the equity of private companies to employees who cash annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say in 60 Minutes that FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case could change their mind
The FBI’s investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed a final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court by at least a week, raising the question of whether the agency’s findings could influence Republican senators to gain their support.
In an interview on Sunday, 60-minute correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could bring something to light that could ultimately change their minds.
Kennedy appeared to be more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I told you in the hearing that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after that, this claim was made, and asked if he did.
He was determined, determined and indisputable."
Graham's voice, however, appears to be carved in stone.
“My opinion is clear as to Brett Kavanaugh, and it would have to explode a bomb,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett has vehemently denied this,” Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she called couldn’t confirm it.”
It is now 36 years.
And I can't see any changes."
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has this festival helped to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York, an annual music festival with an impressive lineup of stars and an equally impressive mission – to fight poverty in the world.
Tens of thousands will attend the Global Citizen Festival, which is taking place for the 7th time this year, to not only experience the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the event’s real goal: combating extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, where an international stakeholder group is trying to fight poverty by motivating more and more people to take an active part in the fight against poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (the other option would be to buy a VIP ticket), you need to complete a number of tasks, including actions such as volunteering, communicating with a leading politician worldwide (by email or phone) or similar measures to raise awareness of the goal – combating poverty.
How successful is the project, given that Global Citizen still has 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of putting a cool free concert on the line, a meaningful way to convince others that it’s time to act, or just another case of so-called clicktivism – if you think signing an online petition or sending a tweet can change anything?
Global Citizen said that since 2011, the project has been able to register more than 19 million actions from its supporters and achieve various goals.
These actions are said to have helped encourage leading politicians around the world to announce commitments and strategies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that result from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid out or raised through fundraising.
According to the group’s estimates, the funds secured so far have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers who have pledged to support children in their optimal development, and who have pledged to help Rwanda fight malnutrition in the country with $35 million after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history,” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling on the UK to improve the nutritional situation of mothers and children, the government announced funding for The Power of Nutrition project, which aims to reach 5 million women and children and provides nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on the site, namely the question of what are the reasons why Global Citizens can fight extreme poverty,
They replied, “It will be a long and arduous journey with highs and lows.
But like the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger and more influential together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the artists who will perform at this year’s event in New York, including Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman as moderators.
The US could use the Navy for blockade purposes to hinder Russian energy exports – Ministry of Interior
According to the Washington Examine, Washington can resort to the Navy if necessary, so that energy from Russia does not reach the markets, including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke said.
Zinke claimed that the use of Russia in Syria is a pretext to explore new energy markets. Russia is currently working at the invitation of the legitimate government in these areas.
“I think the real reason for Russia’s use in the Middle East is to negotiate new markets for energy, just like in Eastern Europe,” he said.
And according to the official, there are ways and means to tackle this.
“The United States, together with the Navy, can ensure that the sea lanes remain open and block them if necessary to ensure that energy from Russia does not reach the market,” he said.
Zinke addressed participants at the event to the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that sees itself as the “voice of power consumers” in the United States.
He drew a comparison between Washington’s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, noting that they are virtually identical.
“The use and replacement of fuels is more or less the economic option in Iran and Russia,” he said, referring to Russia as a “one trick pony” with a fossil fuel-dependent economy.
The statements were made when the Trump administration was expanding exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the far more cost-effective option for consumers in Europe.
To this end, government officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, with which, according to Trump, Berlin became a “captive” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline is worth $11 billion, which is expected to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, an exclusively economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington’s massive resistance to the project is due to economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we all believe that energy should not be used as a means of exerting pressure, and that consumers can choose the suppliers themselves,” Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. has received headwinds from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial organisation, the Federal Association of German Industry (BDI), has urged the US to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
“It is a big problem when a third country interferes in our energy supply,” BDI Executive Board Chairman Dieter Kempf said after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Wants to “Exactly Review” a 2020 Presidential Candidate, Says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would “exactly consider” a presidential candidacy after the midterm elections.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she is considering a candidacy.
According to The Hill, Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that includes women at the top.
Warren plans to "examine accurately" a presidential candidacy after November 6.
Warren said during the meeting that President Trump is directing this country in the wrong direction.
“I am extremely concerned about how Donald Trump is dealing with our democracy,” she said.
Warren has not spoken out in her criticism of Donald Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, she announced that, of course, an FBI investigation is required before the vote.
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren voters do not believe she should run for president in 2020.
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center and Boston Globe, 58 percent of potential voters in Massachusetts indicated that the senator should not run.
32 percent of voters supported such a candidacy.
The survey showed more support for a candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick; with 38 percent who support a potential candidacy, and 48 percent who oppose it.
Other names of prominent Democrats who are likely to be eligible for the 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would officially decide by January.
Sarah Palin speaks at the Donald Trump rally about post-traumatic stress disorder, under which track Palin suffers
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“What my son is going through, what he’s going through when he comes back, all of this can be felt by other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the wounds our soldiers are returning with,” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin described his arrest as an “elephant in space” and said about her son and other war veterans that they come back changed, that they come back aborted, that they come back and wonder if there is this respect for what other soldiers and pilots and every other member of the military have given to the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police.
18 states and D.C. support a legal appeal for a new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal remedy for new U.S. policies that deny victims of gang activity or domestic violence asylum.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district filed a court expert statement in Washington on Friday to support an asylum seeker who challenges the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace vs. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner “and his violent gang sons” abused her, but U.S. officials turned down her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
The prosecutors supporting Grace referred to El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, where many people are applying for asylum in the United States, as nations struggling with major problems of criminal ties and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy repealed a 2014 Board of Immigrant Appeals decision that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of legislation at the state, federal and international levels."
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the respective facts and circumstances of the application, and this court violates this principle,” the court said in a statement.
Furthermore, the lawyers argued in the statement that the policies that deny immigrants access to the country adversely affect the U.S. economy, since immigrants could be more likely to work as entrepreneurs and provide the necessary labor.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered in June that immigration judges no longer grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and the violence of criminal gangs.
“There is asylum for all those who leave their homeland because they are persecuted or out of fear due to race, religion, nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political belief,” Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
It was never the plan to alleviate all the problems, even all the serious problems that people have to deal with every day worldwide, by granting asylum.
Desperate rescue attempts in Palu as the number of fatalities in the race doubles over time
For the survivors, the situation became increasingly worse.
“It’s all very tense,” says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, calming her little feverish son in a rescue center in the devastated downtown of Palu.
“Every minute comes a new ambulance with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce."
Residents returned to their destroyed houses to collect their watered-down possessions and goods and to store everything they could find.
Hundreds were injured, and the staff of the hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were completely overwhelmed.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who contracted vertebral fractures and a broken shoulder, remained outside Palu’s military hospital, where patients were treated outside due to the ongoing strong aftershocks.
With tears in his eyes, he recounted how the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which he shared with his wife and daughter.
“Everything went too fast.
I think I was trapped under the wall," he told the Associated Press, adding that the reason for staying in the city was a wedding.
“I heard my wife’s cries for help, but then there was calm.
I don’t know what happened to my wife and child.
I can only hope they are in a safe place."
US Ambassador Accuses China of Tyranny with ‘Propaganda Ads’
A week after an official Chinese newspaper posted a four-page ad in an American daily announcing the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of exploiting the American press for propaganda purposes.
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid supplement of China Daily in the Des Moines Register, the best-selling magazine in Iowa, after he accused China of meddling in the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, a charge China denies.
Trump’s accusations that Beijing tried to meddle in the U.S. election are in line with U.S. officials’ announcement to Reuters; a new phase of an escalating campaign triggered by Washington to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to run advertisements to boost the economy, Beijing and Washington are currently embroiled in an escalating trade war, with tariffs on imports for both countries.
China’s retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war should hit exporters in states like Iowa that backed Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, which largely exports agricultural products to China, said Beijing has harmed workers, farm owners and businesses.
China, according to Branstad in a statement in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, is now doubling this tyranny by running propaganda ads in its own free press in the US.
“By spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is reclaiming America’s proven tradition of free expression and independent press by putting paid advertising on the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, you will only find a limited number of dissenting voices at the newspaper kiosks here in Beijing, and you will find no real reflection of the differing opinions that the Chinese might have about China’s worrying economic development, given the fact that the media is firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party,” he wrote.
He added that one of China's best-known newspapers did not accept the offer to publish his article, but did not name the newspaper.
Republicans scold female voters ahead of midterm elections with Kavanaugh debacle, observers warn
As many of the most influential Republicans support and defend Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple allegations of sexual violence, observers have warned of a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections that could come from women in particular.
The mood in this regard was extremely tense, and most Republicans have already indicated that they will continue with a vote.
“Such things cannot be reversed,” Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted Senator Jeff Flake’s last-minute push for an FBI investigation was enough to appease angry voters.
“Women don’t forget what happened yesterday, they don’t forget it tomorrow and they don’t forget it in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, first consultant and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters in the Senate floor shouted “November is coming!” when the Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to hold on to Kavanaugh’s nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are an extremely important topic, said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political observer on the news site.
“People say it’s already high, that’s true.
But it could be higher, especially for female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, people between 18 and 29, who, although they don’t like the president, often don’t vote.”
Even before Ford’s public statement detailing her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court’s nominee, observers indicated that a backlash could be the result if the Republicans advance the confirmation.
“This situation is a mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
“It’s not just about the vote of the panel, the final vote or the review of Kavanaugh; it’s also about the way the Republicans handled it and how they handled it,” said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that supports the election of Democrats.
The Americans, however, seem to disagree on whom to believe based on the statements of Ford and Kavanaugh, with a slightly larger proportion taking the latter’s side.
A new YouGov survey showed that 41% of respondents were definitely or probably convinced of Ford’s statement, while 35% indicated that they were definitely or probably giving Kavanaugh faith.
Furthermore, 38% said they believe Kavanaugh likely or definitely lied about his statement, while 30% said the same about Ford.
Following Flake’s pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reported.
Ford made an affidavit last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was attacked by the drunken Kavanaugh at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate exposed his genitals to her when they were at a party during her studies at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is currently launching a startup with the goal of establishing a competition with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The technology legend’s latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee’s solid open source platform.
With Solid, users can choose where their data is stored and who gets access to what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee gave the best that the intention behind Inrupt was the "world domination".
“We need to get active now,” he said on the topic of startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses Solid’s technology so users can create their own personal online data storage or a POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library, as well as other tools for the private and corporate sector.
Similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify, all content is available in one browser at a time.
The special thing about personal online data storage is that the user can only decide who can access which data.
The company refers to this concept as personal empowerment and development over data.
According to company CEO John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company is using resources, processes and corresponding skills to make Solid available to everyone.
The company currently includes Berners-Lee, Bruce, some developers hired to work on this project, and a community of volunteer programmers, and a security platform acquired by IBM.
Beginning this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not exchange views with Facebook and Google on whether to make a comprehensive change that completely reshapes their entire business models overnight.
“We are not asking for your permission.”
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt has the task of providing commercial energy generation and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new, solid-based web.
In 1994, Berners-Lee redesigned the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been instrumental in the debate over net neutrality.
Even with the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m extremely confident about this new era of the web,” he added.
Priest Bernard Vann, bearer of the Victoria Cross in the First World War, was honored
The only clergyman of the Church of England to be awarded the Victoria Cross during World War I was honored 100 years later in his hometown.
Lieutenant Colonel and priest Bernard Vann won the award for his efforts in attacking Bellenglise and Lehaucourt on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed four days later by a sniper and never learned that he had won the highest British war award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Sunday.
One of the grandsons, Michael Vann, said that this act was full of symbolic power, as the memorial stone was unveiled exactly 100 years after the heroic act for which his grandfather was awarded.
According to The London Gazette, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918; through dense fog and under heavy shelling by field guns and machine guns.
Later, he pushed forward to the line of fire and led the line forward with the "greatest bravery" before advancing with a single-handed field weapon and disengaging three of the military units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was shot by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were something he could never do justice to, and at the same time something that makes you humble.
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, he placed a wreath after the parade under the leadership of the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann stated that he felt very honored to be able to participate in the parade, adding that the bravery of a real hero was made visible primarily through the support of many people.
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, instead there was Peppa Pig
Imagine you’ve stayed up all night to watch an exciting Bellator 206, and then you can’t watch the main event.
The San Jose bill contained 13 fights, including 6 on the main map, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 o’clock, just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for their fight, the audience in the UK was not surprised when Peppa Pig was suddenly seen.
Some remained untouched after staying awake until the early hours of the morning to see the fight in particular.
A fan on Twitter described the move to the cartoon character as a somehow bad joke.
“Because of a government regulation, this content is classified as not juvenile, so it had to be switched to a children’s show at 6 a.m.,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa, the pig, exactly."
Bellator’s Chief Executive Officer, Scott Coker, said the company will be working on the schedule to accommodate viewers from the UK in the future.
“I think the problem could have been solved in the repeat game,” he said.
“But it’s 6 a.m. on a Sunday in the audience in the UK, and we’re not going to solve the incident until Sunday our time, Monday local time there.
But we stay on it.
There was quite a lot of communication during the change. It went quite nicely messed up and it wasn't always all nice.
We tried to solve the problem and assumed that it was a technical fault.
What was not the case was a problem on the part of the government.
I promise it won't happen again.
We’re going to reduce the whole thing to 5 instead of 6 fights, as usual, and we’ve tried to give the fans the best possible experience.
The whole situation is pretty sad.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels “submerged” in the topic of sexuality
Tom Daley, who has participated as a water jumper in various Olympic Games, says he grew up feeling inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality, but this feeling had motivated him to become so successful.
The 24-year-old said he had only realized in high school that he was different from others.
In the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs with Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out on gay rights to encourage others.
He also said that since becoming a father, victories at the Olympics are no longer so important to him.
The actual presenter of the long-term show, Kirsty Young, pauses due to illness for a few months.
In the first broadcast of Laverne, he said that he considered himself inferior compared to others, since the love for boys and girls was socially completely unacceptable.
He said: “To this day feeling inferior to others and different from others is the reason for my power and strength and ultimately for my success.”
He wanted to prove that he is a very special personality, not to disappoint anyone when his sexual orientation became known.
The two-time bronze medallist at the Olympics is a prominent LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to advance the decriminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he has spoken out on the issue because fortunately he can live without restrictions and without discrimination and wants to make others brave.
The three-time world champion fell in love with the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013. The realization of falling in love with a man was an absolute surprise for him.
Daley married the 20-year-old Oscar winner last year, but he shared that the age difference had never been an issue.
He thinks that if you had to go through so much as a child and teenager – he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time at the age of 14 and his father died three years later from cancer, it is difficult to find someone of the same age with similar experiences.
The couple have had a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley since June, and Daley believes his entire outlook has changed since then.
Last year, it was all about gold medals.
But for him, there is now more important than Olympic gold medals.
His son Robbie is now his main beneficiary.
He bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain tumor.
Daley said his father did not accept the impending death, and one of the last things he asked for was the tickets for London 2012 as he wanted to be at the front of the line.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t be there anymore,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and only then did I finally realize that he was not invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley won the bronze medal at the 2012 Olympic Games.
“I just knew it was always my dream to dive in front of a local audience at the Olympics – that was crazy,” he said.
His first song selection – Proud by Heather Small – was also influenced by this, which he heard in the run-up to the Olympics and still provided goosebumps.

Mickelson, who is currently out of shape, sits on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record at his 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he has to work hard to make sure it doesn’t become a debacle.
Mickelson, who plays for the 12th time at the event, was sent to the substitute bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday.
Instead of, as usual, being at the center of the action, the five-time major winner spent his day cheering others and working on his game, hoping to fix the problems that beset him.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Mickelson was never the most direct golfer and thus not an ideal crew for the narrow Le Golf National Golf Course, where misdirected balls are regularly penalized.
And as if the place itself was not discouraging enough, Mickelson meets perfectionist British Open champion Francesco Molinari in the ninth game on Sunday, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood, a newcomer to these tournaments, to win all four games this week.
If the Americans put a hot start to the 12 individual games with four points behind, Mickelson’s game could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed confidence in Mickelson and could not add much to it.
“He was perfectly clear about his role today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he was ready for tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He’s one of the world’s most famous personalities and he’s done so much for these teams in the past and this week as well.
I didn’t think he would be in two games.
I had imagined more, but that’s how it went and that’s what we expected.
He wants to be there like everyone else.”
Mickelson will reach Nick Faldo’s record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could mean the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite matched the highlights of his personal record.
Mickelson can record 18 wins, had 20 defeats and reached seven halves, although Furyk reported that his presence alone has enriched the team.
“He’s funny and sarcastic, original and likes to do a few things, and he’s a great person who’s popular with the whole team,” he said.
“I think the younger players were happy to get to know him a little more this week and it was fun to watch them.
He’s a really interesting person who gives a lot of impulses.”
Captain Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn knows that the lead may soon be over
Thomas Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that a big lead leading to the last individual games in the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant situation.
The Dane made his debut in 1997 at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but only just over the finish line and led with the smallest possible lead, scoring a 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2–131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 victory.
“The idea remains that we had a big lead in Valderrama, we had a big lead in Brookline, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but that’s just short,” said Bj<0xC3><0xB8>rn (pictured), after seeing the victory 5–3 of the Class of 2018 lead both on Friday and yesterday at National Le Golf.
The experience shows me and all the team members that it is not over.
Tomorrow is going well.
Get in touch and do the right thing.
The whole thing is only over when the points are on the scoreboard.
We have a goal, we want to win this trophy, and that's where our focus is.
I’ve always said I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we’re fully aware of what’s facing us on the other side: the best players in the world.”
Rejoicing at the performance his players have achieved on a difficult golf course, Bjorn continued: “I would never overdo it.
Tomorrow will be a different caliber.
Tomorrow the individual services are in the foreground and this is a completely different matter.
It’s great to work with a partner when things are going well, but when you’re alone out there, you’re tested to the limits of your golfing skills.
You have to make that clear to the players: get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to get the best out of it.”
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent Jim Furyk will make sure that his players perform better individually than in the team, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who have won three out of four points.
Furyk himself stood on both sides of those big turnarounds on the final day of the tournament, standing on the winning side in Brookline before standing on the losing side after Europe's "Miracle of Medinah".
“I remember every damn word,” he answered the question of how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, motivated his players before the last day.
“We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you would like to take off the quick start that you saw in Brookline and in Medina.
When momentum hits in one direction, it puts the middle games under a lot of pressure.
We set up our team accordingly and send our guys out the way we feel, you know, we're trying to do magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of catching the opponent, he has to compete in the top game against Rory McIlroy, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as other Europeans in the top half of the ranking.
“I chose the guys in this order because I think it covers everything,” Bjorn said of his selection for the individual meetings.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
The newest frigate of the German Navy should have been commissioned in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War era, but it will not be delivered until early next year due to faulty systems and rapidly growing costs, according to local media.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the flagship of the brand new frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the time that called for a military spokesman.
The ship was supposed to be commissioned as early as 2014, but the ambitious project was plagued by worrying problems after delivery.
The four ships of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class, which were ordered by the Navy already in 2007, are intended to replace the old frigates of the Bremen class.
They are intended to include a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft missiles and anti-ship missiles, as well as camouflage technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic reflection.
It should be possible that the newest frigates do not have to return to their home ports for up to two years.
However, the ongoing delays can lead to the fact that the state-of-the-art warships, which are supposed to represent Germany as a naval power, will already be obsolete at the time of their commissioning, according to Die Zeit.
The frigate F125, which was chased by the accident, made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to the shipyard after its delivery.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but German media called a number of significant "software and hardware errors" that would have rendered the new ship unusable in a combat situation.
Software problems are particularly serious, as Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg-class ships are served by a crew of only 120 sailors, only about half as many as on the older Bremen-class frigates.
It has also been known that the ship is much too heavy, which leads to power losses and prevents the Navy from carrying out any future upgrades.
The 7,000-ton "Rhineland-Palatinate" was apparently twice as heavy as ships of a similar class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project, including the training costs of the crew, also became a problem.
Apparently, the costs increased to a staggering <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion, compared to the <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion originally planned.
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly significant given the recent warnings that Germany’s naval power is shrinking.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the German Bundestag’s defence commissioner, confirmed that the navy “is running out of operational ships”.
Bartels said the problem grew larger over time as old ships were taken out of service but no replacement ships were provided.
He complained that none of the frigates of the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class could be taken from the Navy.
National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
At a Scottish Highlands property, new research is being conducted to show how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the results will provide further insights into the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, will track dwarf and mosquito bats, as well as brown long-eared and aquatic bats at Inverewe Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices are placed at key positions on the property to record bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile investigations with portable detectors.
In a noise analysis of all the recordings by experts, the frequency of the bat calls is determined and determined, which species does what.
A map and a report of the habitat are then created to create a detailed picture of their behaviour at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, Nature Conservation Advisor for the NTS, hopes the results will show which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by each species.
These data will help determine the benefits of habitat management measures, such as the creation of meadows, and show how to preserve forest areas for bats and other related species.
Fledermaus stocks in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have declined significantly in the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works that affect sleeping places and lead to the loss of habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flycatchers and the chemical treatment of building materials or also attacks by house cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, due to their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use sophisticated echo mapping to detect insects and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of land throughout Scotland takes the theme of bats very seriously.
It has 10 trained experts who regularly carry out examinations, inspections of sleeping places and sometimes rescue measures.
The organisation has even set up Scotland’s first and only bat reserve at the Threave estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland’s 10 bat species.
Property manager David Thompson explains that the property is the ideal habitat for her.
“Here in Threave we have a great area for bats,” he explains.
“We have the old buildings, many old trees and an excellent habitat.
But there’s a lot we don’t know about bats yet, so we’re doing this work here and on other goods that will help us learn more about what bats need to feel comfortable.”
He stresses the importance of initially excluding the presence of bats before maintenance work in the goods, since it was possible that the unintentional destruction of a single nesting site could kill up to 400 females and juveniles and wipe out the entire population on the spot.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or destroy them or their nesting sites.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Trust, encouraged the population to help.
She explains: “We still have a lot to learn about bats, and in many of our species we don’t know what their populations are.”
Ronaldo denies rape allegations, while his lawyers want to sue the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called allegations of rape against him "fake news" and said people wanted to be "famous" for using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The striker of the national team of Portugal and Juventus Turin was accused of raping in 2009 an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas.
He allegedly then paid her $375,000 to buy up her silence about the incident, Der Spiegel said on Friday.
In an Instagram live video of his 142 million followers, the 33-year-old Ronaldo called the reports “fake news” just hours after their release.
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they reported today: Fake news,” the five-time Ballon d’Or winner said on camera.
“They want to profile themselves by using my name.
That's normal.
You want to be famous with my name, but that's part of the job.
I’m a happy man and everything is fine,” the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo’s lawyers are preparing to sue the mirror over allegations they described as “inadmissible reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy.”
Attorney Christian Schertz said the player demanded compensation for "moral damages at a level equal to the severity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years."
The alleged incident took place in 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly went to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told her that he was “99 percent a good guy” to the “one percent.”
The documents allege Ronaldo confirms the two had sex, but say it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and took photographs of her injuries in a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she was "fear of retribution" and was concerned about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she is now trying to cancel the deal because she was still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to switch from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the alleged incident and switched this summer in a 100-million-euro deal to Italian giant Juve.
Brexit: UK would ‘forever regret’ the loss of automakers
The UK would “forever regret” if it loses its status as a world-leading car manufacturer after Brexit, according to Economy Minister Greg Clark.
He went on to say it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC it would temporarily stop production at the plant in Burnaston at Derby if Britain were to leave the EU.
“We need a deal,” Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays at the border in the event of a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses.
The plant in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis product lines are produced, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
“I am convinced that in the event of an uncontrolled Brexit at the end of March, we will experience production stops at our plant,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s managing director in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have also raised concerns about a tough no-deal exit from the EU and its impact on cross-border trade.
BMW, for example, says it will close its mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
According to car manufacturers, the main concerns are related to risks within the supply chain in the event of a hard Brexit.
Toyota’s manufacturing facility is run on a “just-in-time” basis, which means that parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from both the UK and the EU to manufacture the cars on order.
Should the UK leave the EU on 29 March without an agreement, there could be disruptions at the borders that, according to the industry, could lead to delays and bottlenecks in the parts.
It is impossible for Toyota to maintain a stock in the factory in Derbyshire that is sufficient for more than a day, the company explained, which is why production has to be interrupted.
Clark explained that Theresa May’s Chequers plan on the future relationship with the EU is “precisely designed to avoid such border controls.”
“We want the best deal that allows us, as I said, not only to enjoy the current success, but also to seize this opportunity,” he told BBC Radio 4’s Today.
“The findings not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers show that we need to be able to continue the very successful supply chains so far.”
Toyota could not say how long production would have to be halted, but warned in the long run that additional costs would reduce the plant’s competitiveness and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working in Burnaston for 24 years and is the Unite union’s highest official at the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: “In my experience, these jobs never come back once they’re gone.
A government spokesman said: “We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's planned meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House
Donald Trump’s important meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed “for another week” as the dispute over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates election interference by Russia, connections between Trump’s advisers and Russia, and a possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump would fire the deputy justice minister and thereby endanger Mueller’s independence has been the subject of rumors in Washington for a month.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was addressing the possibility of secretly recording his conversations with Trump and impeaching the president with the help of the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he went to the White House last Monday, while new reports about his supposed resignation became known.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was at the UN General Assembly in New York at the time, was announced for next Thursday.
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed to avoid colluding with the hearing before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, in which both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who had accused him of sexual abuse, said.
On Friday, Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the full Senate vote.
Trump’s spokeswoman Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
To a question about the meeting with Rosenstein, she replied: “A date has not yet been set for this, but it could be this week, but I can also imagine that it will be postponed for another week, given all the things that are going on with the Supreme Court.
This will prove itself, but I always like to keep the press up to date."
Some reporters would probably disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Moderator Chris Wallace asked her about the reason.
Sanders stated that the low frequency of press conferences did not amount to an aversion to the TV reporters’ “effect hacking,” but admitted, “I wouldn’t deny that they’re doing effect hacking.”
She then claimed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
“The president is doing more question-and-answer rounds than any president before him,” she said, without providing accurate evidence: “We’ve looked at these numbers.”
There will still be press conferences, Sanders said, but “if the press has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the President of the United States, it’s far better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you have seen that we have done this often in recent weeks, and that will take the place of the press conference if you can talk to the President of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
Press conferences with him alone are rare.
In New York, perhaps, the president showed why this is so, when he made a run-of-the-mill and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of gathered reporters.
Health Minister writes to Scottish NHS EU workers over Brexit concerns
The Minister of Health addresses people from outside the EU who work in Scotland’s National Health Service (NHS) to express the country’s gratitude and wish to remain in the country even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before the UK’s departure from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already agreed to bear the costs of applications for residence permits for EU citizens working in Scotland’s decentralised public service.
In her letter, Freeman wrote: “During the summer, exit negotiations between the UK and the EU have continued and decisions are expected this fall.
However, the British government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I am aware of what a worrying time this must be for all of you.
That is why I wanted to express once again how much I value the contribution of each and every employee, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of the health service and thus benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is fully your home and we would be very happy if you would stay here."
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercrombie was undergoing emergency surgery after a head injury he sustained on Saturday at the 31-27 defeat to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee State.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before the half-time break.
“He came to the sideline and just collapsed there,” Reed said.
Trainer and medical staff supplied Abercrombie with oxygen on the sideline before he was put on a stretcher and transported away for further examination.
A Tennessee State spokesman told Chris Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had left the surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that “no details are yet known as to the nature or extent of the injury” and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a so-called redshirt, plays in his first season at Tennessee State after switching from Illinois.
Before leaving the game on Saturday, he recorded a total of 5 tackles, bringing his total in the season to 18 tackles.
Foreign investors will have to pay higher stamp duty for the purchase of real estate in the United Kingdom
Investors from abroad will have to pay a higher stamp duty for the purchase of real estate in the UK in the future, according to the new plans of the Conservative Party Homeless
This step is intended to curb the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign for young voters
The increase in the stamp duty will affect all those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today that foreign investors will have to pay a higher stamp duty if you buy real estate in the UK, with the additional income to benefit the homeless.
This move represents an attempt to curb Jeremy Corbyn’s success among young voters, promising to provide more affordable housing and target top earners.
The increase in stamp duty is levied on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom, and the additional income is to be added to the government's campaign against homelessness.
The surcharge, which will be levied in addition to the current stamp duty and including the increase introduced two years ago on second homes and rented residential properties, could amount to up to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects additional revenues of up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million per year through the step.
An estimated 13 percent of newly built properties in London are bought by investors not based in the UK, driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to get a foothold in the real estate business.
Many wealthy areas of the country, especially in the capital, have become “spirit cities” due to the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the UK.
The new strategy follows just a few weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to allow more young people to own their first home.
He accused construction companies of keeping real estate prices high by buying up land without using it, and urged Theresa May to drop quotas on affordable housing to end Britain’s “housing shame.”
Opposition leader Corbyn announced an eye-opening set of proposals for housing reforms, ranging from a rent bond to a ban on evictions for no good reason.
He also wants to give city councils more powers in the construction of new apartments.
May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream that life should be better from generation to generation.
And that means repairing our broken housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who live and work here and want to build a life.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for people who do not live in the UK as it is for companies based abroad to buy real estate as it is for hard-working British citizens.
The dream of home has become too distant for too many people and the unworthiness of homelessness continues to be too great a problem.”
Jack Ross: ‘My biggest goal is to manage Scotland’
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says his ‘biggest goal’ is to become the manager of the Scottish team at some point.
The 42-year-old Scot enjoys the challenge of breathing in the new life of the club from the North-East of England, which is currently in third place in League One and lacks three points to the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St. Mirren back to the first Scottish league last season.
“I wanted to play as a player for my country.
I made it to the bank and that’s it,” Ross told BBC Scotland’s Sports Sound.
“But as a child I have often seen my father play Scotland in Hampden and this is something that always pulls me back.
However, this opportunity would only come if I were successful in club management.”
Ross' predecessors in the role of manager of Sunderland include Dock Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former head of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow in the footsteps of such an established name at such a club after he had previously rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
Success will be measured by whether I can bring the club back to the Premier League.
Given the structure and opportunities in this club, he is undoubtedly in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I would probably only consider my time here a success if I bring the club back there.”
Ross has a three-year management career, after a stint as a deputy manager at Dumbarton and a 15-month tenure as a coach at Hearts.
Then he helped Alloa recover from relegation to the third league and helped St. Mirren from the edge of relegation to win the championship the following season.
Ross says he now feels more comfortable than ever before in his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was a real divorce,” he remembers when he took over Alloa’s responsibility.
“I really think management was the right thing for me, more than just playing.
It sounds funny, because I didn’t look bad, was able to live well and experienced some very pleasant ups and downs.
But playing can be hard.
There are a lot of things you have to go through every week.
I still do this through in terms of stress and pressure in my job, but management feels right.
I've always wanted to manage and now I do it. I've never felt so comfortable in my skin in my whole life as an adult."

The perfect time for a glass of beer is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., according to a study
The heat wave in the summer has missed revenue from Britain’s crippling pubs an upswing, while restaurant chains have come under greater pressure.
In July, pub and bar companies recorded a revenue growth of 2.7 percent, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent, according to statistics.
Peter Martin of the company consultancy CGA, which compiled the figures, explained: “Prolonged sunshine and England’s longer-than-expected continued participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a pattern similar to the previous June, in which pubs were able to record sales increases of 2.8 percent.
The drop of 1.8 percent recorded by the restaurant industry in June continued to increase in July.
Pubs and bars with a focus on drinks showed by far the best performance, with area-adjusted revenue growth rising higher than it dropped at restaurants.
Pubs with a focus on food also suffered in the sun, but not as drastically as the restaurant operators.
It seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
In the managed pubs and bars, beverage sales increased by 6.6 percent per month, while food sales decreased by three percent.”
Paul Newman, of the RSM leisure and restaurant industry analysts, said: “These results continue the trend we have been seeing since the end of April.
The weather and the influence of important social or sporting events remain the biggest factors for sales in the out-of-home market.
It’s not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle with problems, but sales losses of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have come at a worse time for operators of companies focusing on food, and it remains to be seen whether the more temperate temperatures in August will provide the much-needed respite."
Overall sales growth for pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the decline in brand rollouts.

One in five children owns secret social media accounts that it hides from their parents
One study shows that every fifth child, some as young as 11 years old, has secret social media accounts that keep it secret from parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools has found an increase in so-called “fake insta” pages
The message fuels fears that sexual content will be posted
Twenty percent of students said they had a “main account” to show it to their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11 years old, create social media accounts that can keep it secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools showed a rapid increase in so-called “fake insta” accounts, a reference to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news is fueling fears that sexual content is being shared.
Twenty percent of students said they have a clean “main account” that they can show to their parents, as well as private accounts.
A mother who came across the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found one teenager who asked the other to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two profiles, with half admitting to owning private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It’s disturbing that so many teenagers are being led to create online spaces where parents and teachers can’t find them.
Eilidh Doyle to become ‘Voice of Athletes’ on Scottish Sports Council
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board at its annual general meeting as a non-executive member.
Doyle is Scotland’s most award-winning athlete and chairman Ian Beattie described the election as a great opportunity for sports officials to benefit from their extensive international experience over the past decade.
“Eilidh is respected in the athletics community of Scotland, the UK and the world and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would greatly benefit from their election to the council,” Beattie said.
Doyle said, “I look forward to acting as the voice of the athletes and hope that I can make a real contribution and lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won the distance over 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, calls a total of four Olympic gold medals his own and now frequently appears as a BBC expert, could no longer run after a temporary circulatory disorder.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago I suffered a stroke.
I couldn't walk anymore.
The doctors say that no one can say if or how far I will be healed.
It was hard work, but I completely recovered, learned to walk again and do mobility exercises today!
Thank you for the encouraging news!"
An advertisement for milk pumps that compares mothers to cows causes excitement in the network
One milk pump manufacturer made a splash in the net with an advertising clip that compared nursing mothers to milking cows.
To launch the world’s first low-noise portable milk pump, consumer technology manufacturer Elvie has released a music video that is not meant to be taken seriously to emphasise the freedom that the pump gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a hay-filled barn with cows in the background to a song that contains lines of text like, “Yes, I’m milking myself, but you don’t see a cock on me” or “if you haven’t noticed, these are not udders but my breasts.”
The chorus continues: “Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the babies, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies.”
However, the advertising posted on the company’s Facebook page has sparked controversy on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video came across mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it disinherited the “fears” of the dairy industry.
“It was a very bad decision to promote this product with cows.
Just like us, they need to become pregnant and give birth to a calf to produce milk, with the difference that their young are taken away from them within a few days of birth,” the statement said.
Elvie's milk pump discreetly fits in a still bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another comment read: “Completely traumatic for mother and baby.
But hey, why don't we use them to apply for a milk pump for mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?"
Another person added: “Such a non-reality advertisement.”
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that she found the song "urcomic".
“I think that’s a brilliant idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
When I was pumping out, I felt just like a cow.
The clip is a bit crazy, but I’m not trying to overinterpret it.
It’s a great product,” one person wrote.
Another person commented: “This is a funny advertisement aimed at mothers who use milk pumps (often in the workplace or in the toilets) and feel like ‘cows’.
This is not an advertisement for or against the dairy industry."
At the end of the video, the group reveals to women that everyone danced with the discreet pumps in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the realization that many women who use milk pumps tend to feel like dairy cows.
However, Elvie’s pump is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and discreetly fits into a still bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, or even walk out during the pumping process.
Ana Balarin, Partner and ECD at Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a bold and provocative market launch.
By comparing nursing mothers with dairy cows, we wanted to focus on milk pumps and all the challenges associated with them, while at the same time presenting in an entertaining and comprehensible way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump allows.
This isn’t the first time Elvie’s pump has hit the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, designer Marta Jakubowski appeared with a double mother on the Catwalk while using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children were quietly taken to a tent city on the Texas border
The number of migrant children interned is as high as ever, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively the same, among other things as tightened rhetoric and measures by the Trump administration have made it more difficult to accommodate children with caretakers.
Traditionally, most caregivers themselves were illegal immigrants and are now afraid to even become the target for a deportation when they report to take in a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential caregivers and other adult members of their household would have to hand over their fingerprints and share this data with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told Congress that the agency was arresting dozens of people who had applied for care of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of the detainees did not have prior entries in the criminal record.
“Almost 80 percent of people who are either caregivers themselves or members of a caregiver’s household are staying illegally in the country and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens.
That is why we will continue to persecute these people,” Albence said.
In order to speed up the handling of children’s cases, officials introduced new rules that, according to housing staff, require some children to appear in court within a month rather than 60 days after detention, which was previously the standard.
Many will appear via video and not in person to appear before an immigration judge for their legal status.
In the event of a negative decision, the person will be deported quickly.
The longer these children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, according to housing workers and reports released in the last month from the system, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempted outbursts.
Defenders say that these concerns are reinforced at a larger facility like Tornillo, as there are signs that a child has problems, due to the size being easier to overlook.
They also explained that trauma, which many of the children already suffer, can be exacerbated if they are taken to a tent city without emotional preparation or enough time to say goodbye to friends.
Syria calls on US, French and Turkish ‘occupational forces’ to withdraw immediately
In a speech before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country’s civil war is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism and “will be treated accordingly.”
“You must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,” he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the “war on terror” was almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died and millions more people have been driven from their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus “will continue to fight this holy battle until all Syrian territories are cleansed” of both terrorist groups and “any illegal foreign presence.”
The United States has stationed about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 ground troops in the war-torn country.
Regarding the refugees, Moualem explained that the conditions for their return are in place and he accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that prevent refugees from going home.
“We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to allow the return home,” he said.
“They are politicizing a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union warned that no building aid would be granted to Syria as long as there was no political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats said the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib was an opportunity to advance political talks.
The deal between Russia and Turkey turned a broad-based offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces into the province where three million people live.
Moualem stressed, however, that the agreement has “clear deadlines” and expressed his hope that military action against jihadists, including fighters of the Nusra Front allied with al-Qaeda, will be “expelled.”
UN Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee soon, consisting of government and opposition members, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem cited the Syrian government’s conditions for participation in the committee, saying its work should be limited to “revising the articles of the current constitution” and warned of interference.
Why Trump Will Win His Re-election
With this logic, Trump would win his re-election in 2020, should not, as many liberal viewers probably hope, an impeachment or scandal prematurely end his presidency.
This would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic finale of a presidency of all time.”
So far, there is no sign that the audience is tired.
Since 2014, CNN’s best-time ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC’s ratings almost tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News reached an average of 2.4 million viewers at its best broadcast time, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, with MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” leading the ratings on to 3.5 million viewers on evenings with important news.
“It’s like a fire that attracts people magically because it’s something we don’t understand,” said Neal Bear, showrunner of the ABC drama series “Designated Survivor” about a cabinet member who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a former comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys’ Club, has a different theory.
She remembers a taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he would vote for Trump.
She asked him about the reason.
“He said, ‘Because he makes me laugh,’” Scovell told me.
Chaos is entertainment.
Of course, the stories from Washington, unlike everything on television, can determine the future of the principle decision on abortions Roe v. Wade, the possible unification of families and the health of the global economy.
Switching off is a luxury that only the most privileged spectators can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when one becomes aware of having watched for six hours of an expert round discussing Bob Woodward’s use of sources from the so-called “Deep Background” for his book “Fear,” Paul Manafort’s $15,000 expensive ostrich-leather bomber jacket (according to the Washington Post, a “self-delivery”).
I will never be able to see Super Mario with the same eyes again.
“Part of what he does makes it feel like a reality show he presents to you every night,” says Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of the series “The Three from the pawnshop,” about Trump’s rotating cast and daily turnarounds (a dispute with football league pre-NFL’s Kim Joun-Zaung).

When I reached Fleiss this week, it was sunny 27 degrees in front of his house on the north coast of the Hawaiian island of Kauai, but he crept inside and watched MSNBC while simultaneously recording CNN.
He simply couldn’t get off the screen, not when Justice Brett Kavanaugh was about to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was at stake.
“I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows back then and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out they were right.”

Donations flow to the narrowest races for seats in Congress in the midterm elections
It’s little surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th electoral district is flooded with donations, thanks to the newly drawn boundaries of the electoral districts, which resulted in two incumbents competing for the same seat.
The recently re-drawn suburban district of Pittsburg is pitted against Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb takes on another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which heavily overlaps with the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania State Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts violated the Constitution and were manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district triggered an exchange of campaign funding between the major financial arms of the parties, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a highly-regarded special election in March around the state's 18th electoral district.
This seat was held by a Republican for over a decade and Trump won there by 20 percentage points.
Political experts give the Democrats easy leadership.
The U.S. reviewed the punishment of El Salvador for its support for China, but then withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing without encountering much resistance from Washington.
Trump held a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Valero in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until partners threw out the Trump Organization’s management team.
U.S. State Department officials have decided to withdraw the heads of all U.S. foreign missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama due to “the recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan,” according to Heather Nauert, the ministry’s spokeswoman in a statement earlier this month.
However, only in the case of El Salvador were thought about punitive measures, which in 2017 received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid, including for drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed penalties, including cuts in financial assistance and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings progressed, North and Central American officials moved a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow a similar meeting last year and represented a step forward in efforts to deter migrants from moving toward the United States.
However, in mid-September, senior government officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place and thus effectively ended the consideration of punitive measures for El Salvador.
Vice-President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference scheduled for mid-October to signal the importance of the Assembly’s government, according to diplomats.
The three U.S. diplomatic representatives have quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without further harsh communications or punitive measures from Washington.
A government spokesman for John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to comment on the internal talks on condition of anonymity.
Their comments were confirmed by an external analyst close to the government, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
Learn from history
The next big surprise could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report on Trump’s possible obstruction of justice, for which there is now sufficient evidence in the public domain.
Mueller is now reportedly also investigating whether Trump’s campaign team conspired with Russia in its attack on the U.S. election.
Should the Congressional majority change, Trump will face an organ that will force him to account, at the exact moment he is about to stand before the voters again; and possibly before a jury jury.
That’s a lot of ‘ifs’ and I don’t want to say that the case of Donald Trump, or that of his European counterparts, is inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we need to make decisions that will affect how long the fight will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to carry out a coup against Hitler if the West had merely resisted him and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We have failed, and missed a way to avoid the years of barbarism that followed.
The course of history revolves around such turning points and the unstoppable march of democracy is either accelerated or delayed.
Americans are facing several such turning points.
What do we do if Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who decides the future of Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in Devil’s kitchen since that newspaper reported last year that he suggested secretly recording the president and speculating that he was above unfit for office.
Rosenstein denies the New York Times report.
“How will we respond if Brett Kavanaugh’s newly-ordered FBI investigation is not complete or fair or he is confirmed in office despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and falsification?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections for a congress that will force Trump to account?
If we fail in these tests, we have a long winter ahead of us.
But I don’t think we will fail because of what I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same regime that once occupied my embassy home.
She survived, immigrated to America and sent me off 60 years later to light Sabbath candles on the table with the Crooked Cross.

Graham Dorrans from the Rangers optimistic ahead of the game against Vienna
The Rangers receive Rapid Wien on Thursday in the knowledge that a victory against the Austrians after the impressive draw against Villareal in Spain at the beginning of the month will put them in a good position for the qualification of Group G of the Europa League.
Due to a knee injury, Graham Dorrans could not appear until the 2-2 draw against Villareal, but he believes that the Rangers can use this result as a springboard for bigger.
“This was an important point for us, as Villareal is very good,” said the 31-year-old.
We went into the game with the conviction that we could make something out of it and we drove home with a point.
Maybe we could have won in the end, but overall a draw was probably a fair result.
They probably dominated in the first half, but we struggled in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday will be another great European night.
Hopefully we will get three points, but this will be a tough game, as they have achieved a good result in the last game, but I am sure that we can go through this with the audience behind us and achieve a positive result.
Last year was definitely difficult, with everything that happened with my injuries and the changes in the club itself, but now there is a kind of feel-good factor.
The team is good and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
Hopefully we can now look forward, leave the last season behind us and be successful."
Fear of retirement leads to sleepless nights in women.
Although the survey participants knew exactly how to care for them, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the participants in the Nationwide study reported talking to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk to their children about it.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but don’t take the necessary steps to lead the conversation,” said Holly Snyder, vice president of the life insurance division at Nationwide.
This is where you should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to care for you if you don’t express your wishes in time.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you want to be cared for, as these decisions can be a significant factor in determining costs.
Bring your financial advisor on board: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to finance these expenses.
Your financial decisions for long-term care can include traditional care insurance, hybrid capital-forming life insurance to help cover these costs, or self-insurance with your own assets – as long as they own the money.
Work out your legal documents: Address legal disputes at the last minute.
Set up a precautionary authority so that you instruct a trusted person to monitor your medical care and ensure that the health professionals meet your wishes, you should be unable to express them yourself.
Also consider a power of attorney for your finances.
You choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions for you and ensures that your bills are paid should you not be able to do so.
Don’t forget the details: Imagine that your older parent has a medical emergency and is on their way to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medication or allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan so that you are ready.
“It’s not just the financial issues that matter. Who are the doctors?” asked Martin.
“What is drug treatment?”
Who takes care of the dog?

Man shot several times with air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with an air rifle when he went home after a job among friends.
The victim, a man in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials described the shootings, which occurred around 02:30 British time, as a "voluntary act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, adding that the death toll is expected to rise.
Because of the failed communication systems, aid workers were unable to obtain information from the Donggala government district, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province and is located at the end of a narrow bay on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city just celebrated its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami occurred.
Donggala is a government district in the northwest of Sulawesi Island, stretching over a coastline of over 300 km (180 miles) in length.
In the government district, an administrative unit below the province, an estimated 299,200 people lived in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main sources of income for the economy of Central Sulawesi, especially the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but it focuses mainly on Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been victims of earthquakes and tsunamis several times in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia’s Disaster Protection Authority.
In 1938, over 200 people were killed by a tsunami that destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
West Donggala was hit by a tsunami in 1996 that killed nine people.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire, and is regularly visited by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: A strong earthquake on the western coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh in northern Sumatra triggered a tsunami on December 26 that struck 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in coastal areas of the Indian Ocean, almost half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of severe earthquakes shook the western coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the Nias islands off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake shook the south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggering a tsunami that hit the south coast and claimed nearly 700 lives.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake shook one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami of up to 10 meters in height that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed about 300 lives.
2016: A slight earthquake shook the Pidie Jaya government district in Aceh, causing destruction and panic when people were reminded of the destruction of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was triggered, but more than 100 people died from collapsing buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes hit the Indonesian island of Lombok, which is popular with tourists, and claimed more than 500 lives, especially on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.
Sarah Palin's son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska’s former governor and former vice-presidential candidate, was arrested on charges of assault.
The 29-year-old Palin from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstruction of domestic violence reporting, and resistance to state violence, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaskan police.
According to the police report, he took the phone away from an acquaintance when she wanted to talk to the police.
According to KTUU, Palin is in custody at the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and a $500 bail has been imposed.
He appeared in court on Saturday, where, when asked about his plea, he responded with “Not guilty, quite sure,” according to the network.
Palin is accused of having committed three Class A felonies, which can be punishable by up to a year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which can be punished with a day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been filed against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently pending before the Veteran’s Court of Alaska.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of a crime and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotic drugs in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans’ organizations in 2016 after she traced her son’s behavior to a post-traumatic stress disorder following his time in Iraq.
Tsunami after earthquake in Indonesia: hundreds dead
At least 384 people died after an earthquake rocked the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are disrupted and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake occurred just off the coast of Central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia’s capital Jakarta.
On the social networks circulate videos from the time when the wave hit the country.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal Prosecutor Calls for Rare Death Penalty for Suspects in New York Terrorist Attack
The federal prosecutor’s office in New York is demanding the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the defendant in the New York City terror attack that cost eight lives, a rare punishment that has not been imposed in the state since 1953 for a federal crime.
The 30-year-old Saipov is accused of using a rented pick-up from the Home Depot construction market chain for a terrorist attack, during which he hopped on a bike path along the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October while crossing pedestrians and cyclists.
To justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov “targeted” the eight victims and “consciously” inflicted serious bodily injuries, according to the statement of intent for the death penalty claim filed in the southern New York district.
Both charges could be punishable by death, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, a federal investigative jury in Saipov filed a 22-point indictment that includes eight counts of murder against the background of organized crime normally used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, as well as a charge of the use of force and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack requires “fundamental planning and intent,” according to the prosecutors, who described the manner in which Saipov carried out the act as “disgusting, cruel and depraved.”
“Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov inflicted damage, pain and loss on the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,” the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentinian tourists.
For more than a decade, the Southern District of New York has not pursued a case with the goal of demanding the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers and eventually sentenced to a life sentence in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was carried out in New York in a federal offense was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple convicted two years before the conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed with the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, testified in the days and months after the attack of lack of remorse, according to court documents.
He told investigators to feel good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to act after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also demanded, according to the police, to hang the flag of ISIS in his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty in all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of the public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "of course disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
“We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty, instead of accepting a guilty plea in exchange for a life sentence without the possibility of dismissal, will only prolong the trauma that all involved suffer,” Patton said.
Saipov’s defense team had previously asked the prosecution not to demand the death penalty.
A member of the Conservative Party calls for NIGEL FARAGE to transfer Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage vowed to mobilize “the power of the people” today during a protest at the Tories conference.
The former head of the Ukip party said politicians must “feel the pressure” of the Eurosceptics, while a member of Theresa May’s party suggested that Farage should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that the UK would be “already out” if Farage were Brexit ministers.
The challenge that May faces in reconciling her deeply divided party has been exacerbated by members of her party who are in favour of staying in the EU participating in a separate anti-Brexit demonstration that took place in the city.
The prime minister is having trouble keeping her compromise plan Chequers on track despite attacks from Brexit supporters, Brexit opponents and the EU.
Allies insisted that despite the counter-reactions, they should continue to try to negotiate a deal with Brussels, thus forcing eurosceptics and the opposition Labour Party to decide between their package and the “chaos”.
Bone stated at the Leave Means Leave demonstration in Solihull that “checkers belong to the garbage.”
He suggested that Farage be appointed a peer and that he be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
“If he was responsible for it, we would already be out there,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: ‘I will stand for Brexit, but Chequers belongs to the garbage.’
He stressed his opposition to the EU: ‘We did not fight in world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Bone dismissed claims that public opinion has changed since the 2016 referendum: ‘The idea that the British people have changed their mind and now want to stay in the EU is completely wrong.’
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns was also at the demonstration, telling reporters: “I’m just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“The compromise is unpopular in public, the opposition won’t vote for it, it’s unpopular in our own party and with our activists who are actually walking the streets and making sure we get elected.
Please give up checkers and start listening.’
In a sharp message to May, she continued: ‘The prime minister will keep her jobs if you keep her promises.’
Farage said in a speech that politicians must “feel the pressure” if they are to be in the process of cheating on the 2016 referendum decision.
“This is now a matter of trust between us, the people, and our political class,” Farage said.
“They’re trying to cheat Brexit and that’s why we’re here today to tell them ‘so you don’t get out of it.’
In front of an enthusiastic crowd, he went on to say: ‘I want you to feel the pressure of our political class, which is just about to betray Brexit.
“We are mobilizing the power of the people of this country, who will help us win the referendum and never come to rest as long as we are not an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.”
At the same time, Brexit opponents marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A few activists waved banners of the Tories Against Brexit group, a group of Brexit opponents within May’s party that was launched over the weekend.
Lord Adonis, a peer of the Labour Party, made fun of the Tories who had security issues with a party app at the opening of the conference.
“These are the people who are telling us that they can make sure that the IT systems, just like all the technology for Canada Plus Plus, for the smooth border, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” Adonis said.
“This is a farce.
There is simply no good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to ‘examine’ presidential candidacy
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said in a statement that she would “precisely examine the presidential candidacy” after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future at a meeting with voters in West Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, is in the race for re-election for the Senate against Massachusetts Republican MP Geoff Diehl, who was vice-chairman of Trump’s Massachusetts campaign team in 2016.
It has been the focus of speculation that it could challenge Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters in the so-called Town Hall format since Trump took office.
One of the people present asked her if she wanted to run for the presidency.
Warren responded that it would be time for women to “go to Washington and repair our broken government and that includes women at the top.”
Arrest after Death Shots on LSU Player Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested Friday in the case of the deadly shooting of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at a press conference that it had arrested 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. Eastern Time.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday and asked for help in identifying the man seen on the footage.
The 20-year-old Sims was shot dead Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result of this injury,” police chief Murphy J. Paul said on Saturday, according to sports media portal 247sports.
Wayde wanted to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being at the scene and possessing a gun and shooting at Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without further incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The two-meter tall Sim grew up in Baton Rouge and played in 32 games with 10 starting lineups last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the world championship title after his team gave him the victory over Sebastian Vettel
From the moment Valtteri Bottas landed in qualifying for Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes’ Stallords would play a big role in the race.
From the pole position, Bottas made a good start and it was almost as if he was leading Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack his teammates.
Vettel first went into the box and let Hamilton bump into traffic at the end of the field, a decision that should have been decisive.
The Mercedes went into the box a lap later and landed behind Vettel, but Hamilton overtook him after a tight wheel-to-wheel maneuver in which the Ferrari driver reluctantly released the inside, risking to hold out after two moves to defend the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in one of the back seats of the field and was in seventh place on his 21st birthday after the end of the first round.
He was then the fastest for much of the race, holding on to his tyres to finish quickly and overtake Kimi Raikkonen for fourth place.
He finally went into the box in the 44th round and failed to make a step in the remaining eight rounds, while Raikkonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day, as Valtteri had a great performance all weekend and acted like a real gentleman when he was supposed to let me down.
The team has done an excellent job to achieve a double win," Hamilton said.
A Case of Really Bad Body Language
President Donald Trump made fun of Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election campaign event on Saturday, insisting on not passing on Christine Blasey Ford’s letter accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse to the press.
At the event in West Virginia, President Ford did not directly address the statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but commented that the proceedings in the Senate show that people are “common, evil and dishonest.”
“One thing that could happen and the wonderful thing that has happened in the Senate over the last few days is when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and mean and mean and dishonest,” he said.
“If you look at the leaks and you say, ‘Oh, I wasn’t.
It wasn't me."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you responsible for the leak?
Think of your answer... Did you publish the document – “Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no.
I didn't publish it."
Okay, just a moment, please.
No, we didn't publish it," he added, mimicking the senator's voice.
Feinstein filed the letter with Ford's charges against Kavanaugh in July, and it was released in early September, but Feinstein disputes that the leak came from her office.
“I did not hide Dr. Ford’s allegations, I did not publish your story,” Feinstein told the committee.
“She asked me to keep the letter secret and I responded to her request for secrecy.”
Her denial didn’t seem to be working well with the president, who said at the election campaign event on Saturday night: “I’m telling you one thing, that was a very bad body language.
Maybe she didn’t, but that was the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
In his ongoing defense of the judge candidate accused of sexual assault by three women, he claimed the Democrats would use the allegations for their own purposes.
“They are determined to regain power by all means.
You see the meanness, the evilness, they don't care who they hurt when they get under the wheels to get power and control," the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars made the loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants on Friday good again by a 5:3 win in the back-to-back game in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants led early with two goals, following hits by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the balance before Dwyer restored the Giants' lead.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win with two goals.
This was for the men of Adam Keefe, who unexpectedly beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night, the third defeat in the Elite League of the season.
This was the fourth match of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute after 3:35 minutes of a presentation by Kendall McFaull, and four minutes later David Rutherford delivered the presentation as Beauvillier expanded the lead.
In this exciting opening phase, Sullivan brought the home team back into the game after 13:10 minutes, before Matt Marquardt helped Cownie to his knockout goal after 15:16 minutes.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead ahead of the halftime break when he scored his second goal of the evening just before the end of the first half.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard once again faced off with a power play hit in the 28th minute.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen lead Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second half and Nielsen then secured his team the victory with a fifth goal after just under half of the second half.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will play at home next Friday at Milton Keynes Stadium.
Flight attendant died after he was certain that hundreds of people on an airplane escaped the earthquake
A flight attendant in Indonesia is celebrated as a hero after he found death to safely launch a plane carrying hundreds of people on board.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after the island of Sulawesi was shaken by a devastating earthquake on Friday that triggered a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks are still felt in the region and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his post in the heavily swaying control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to make sure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He jumped out of the tower when he thought he was falling.
Agung later died in hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Indonesia’s air safety service, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australia’s ABC News.
“We deployed a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to bring him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter could reach Palu.
We are deeply affected by this news,” he added.
At the same time, authorities fear that the death toll could rise to several thousand, with the country’s disaster relief agency saying access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The number is expected to rise further as many bodies are still under the rubble, while others cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the authorities.
Waves up to 6 meters high have devastated Palu, which will hold a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring relief and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute a new ambulance comes with dead people.
Clean drinking water is scarce.
Supermarkets are being looted everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don’t know what they will find there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get much worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and said in a speech to the country’s military: “I ask you to work every day and night to complete all the tasks associated with the evacuation.
Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was already shaken this year by earthquakes in Lombok, which killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now reports of a missing person after plane crash in lagoon
The airline that conducted the flight, which plunged into a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia, now reports a missing person after initially claiming that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a statement that they could not say anything about a passenger's stay until Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more details about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue the other passengers and crew members after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
Officials said seven people had to be taken to a hospital.
The airline said six more passengers were in the hospital on Saturday but were in stable condition.
The cause and exact course of the accident remained unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane landed in the lagoon just off the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was flying over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was flying very flat.
“That’s a very good thing,” Jaynes said.
Jaynes explained that he and others were able to wade through hip-deep water to the emergency exits at the sides of the sinking plane.
He said the flight attendants panicked and screamed and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working nearby to improve a mooring site rushed in an inflatable boat to help bring people to the coast before the plane sank into about 30 meters (100 feet) of deep water.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, 111 people were killed in crashes by airlines registered in Papua New Guinea, but none of them affected Air Niugini.
Analyst reconstructs the course of the night in which a woman was burned alive
The indictment closed its evidence on Saturday in the retrial of a case in which a man is accused of banishing a woman from Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the U.S. Department of Justice, spent hours as an expert on information analysis.
He explained to the jury how he reconstructed the movements of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of her death using cell phone calls.
Rowlett said he received position data from various phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers on the night of her death, contradicting his previous statements, according to the Clarion Ledger newspaper.
When the data showed that his phone was at Chambers during the period in which he claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police spoke to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been to the city that day.
When the prosecutors asked if Tellis had told the truth when he claimed to have been in Sanford’s pick-up that night, Sandford said he had lied “because my pick-up was in Nashville.”
Another contradiction was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers at the time of her death for two weeks.
Cell phone records, however, indicated that they knew each other for a week.
Rowlett explained that some time after Chambers' death, Tellis was getting their messages, calls, and contact information off his phone.
“He took her out of his life,” Hale said.
The defense is expected to begin their pleas on Sunday.
The judge assumes that the proceedings will then go before the jury on that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
A hip-hop trio wants to challenge the genre’s negative image by filling its music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claim that Hip Hop has moved away from its roots of political message and social engagement.
They want to go back to their roots and make hip hop socially conscious again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have recently experienced a renaissance in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black one?!
New York City nanny sues couple for firing after 'racist' text message
A New York nanny sues a couple over a discriminatory dismissal after she received a misdirected message from her mother in which she complained that she was “still a black man.”
The couple denied being racist and compared the legal dispute to an “expression.”
Two-time mother Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman expressed her dismay when she found out that her new mother-in-law, Giselle Maurice, was black when she started her first day at work in 2016.
“NEEEEEEEEEEIN, ANOTHER BLACK,” Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
Instead of sending this to her husband, however, she sent the message to Maurice.
After recognizing her faux pas, the “embarrassed” Plasco-Flaxman fired Maurice, claiming that the open-minded African-American day mother had done bad work and was expecting a Filipino instead, according to the New York Post.
Maurice was paid for her workday and then sent home with an Uber.
Now, Maurice sues the couple for compensation for the redundancy and claims compensation for the $350 a day she would have taken over six months for the job for which she had originally been booked, but without a contract, and for which she would have lived with the couple.
“I want to show them, look, you don’t do that,” she told the newspaper on Friday, “I know it’s discrimination.”
The couple rejected the racism allegations, arguing that the dismissal was the sensible step, as they feared Maurice, after insulting them, could no longer be trusted.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists,” husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But would you entrust your children to a person who was rude to them, even if it was by accident?
Your newborn baby?
Come on."
Plasco compared the lawsuit to an “expression” and said his wife was expecting a baby in just two months and was “in a difficult situation.”
Do you want to interest such a person?
That’s not very nice,” the investment banker added.
As the legal battle continued, the couple were quickly condemned in public and denounced on social media, where they were criticized for their behavior and logic.
Paddington’s publishers feared readers wouldn’t identify with a talking bear, a new letter reveals
Karen Jankel, daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the book’s adoption, said of the letter: “It’s hard to get into someone who reads it for the first time before it’s published.
Today it’s very funny with our knowledge of Paddington’s huge success.”
She said that her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before being inspired by a little toy bear to write the children’s book, had had no problem with it, his work would have been rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of the publication after his death last year was “bitterly sweet”.
She explained that her father was secretly proud of Paddington’s success, which she describes as “a very important family member.”
“He was a very quiet man and did not boast,” said Jankel.
“But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a kid who does something special: you’re proud, even if it wasn’t really your own performance.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Although he invented and created it, he always gave Paddington the responsibility for his own success."
My daughter died and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone
After landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the doctors tried in vain to save her life.
“Nad called regularly to say that it looked really bad and that the doctors gave her little chance,” said Ednan-Laperouse.
“Then I got a call from Nad telling me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And that's what I did.
I told her, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey."
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines given to her by the doctors to keep her heart pumping slowly faded away and left her body.
She had died shortly before and this was the moment when everything went down.
I couldn’t do anything except wait while I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t scream or howl because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I really had to pull myself together.”
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, who was now mourning the loss of her daughter, along with the other passengers who didn’t know anything about what she was going through, boarded the plane.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
I had lowered my head and tears were running over my cheeks all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this overwhelming sense of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women hang cards to prevent suicides on bridges
Two women who have lost relatives to a suicide attempt to stop others from taking their lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelley Humphreys hung up on a bridge in Wales maps with inspiring messages and phone numbers for counseling centers.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and was just 18 when he committed suicide.
“I don’t want parents to feel the way I feel every day,” she said.
The 45-year-old Davis, who lives in Lydney, said her son was looking forward to a promising career as a chef and had a contagious smile.
“Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten a room."
However, he quit his job before his death, as he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s body was found by his then 11-year-old brother.
Davis said: “I’m always concerned that this could have a consequence.”
Davis designed the cards “to show people that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it’s a friend.
Don’t be silent: you have to talk about it.”
Humphreys, who has been friends with Davies for years, lost her partner Mark, with whom she was with for 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t say he felt down or depressed,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
On Christmas Day, he was at a low point; when the children unpacked their gifts, he didn't look them in the eye or anything."
She said that his death was a great trauma for her, but that she had to go through it: “There’s a huge hole in the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future in the lurch as the FBI begins investigations
“I thought if we could actually get something he asked for, so a time-limited and limited investigation, then maybe we could get a little bit of consensus,” Flake said on Saturday, fearing that the committee would “break apart” in the partisan standoff.
Why didn’t Kavanaugh and his Republican backers want FBI investigations?
Their reluctance can be traced back to the timing alone.
The November 6 midterm elections are just five weeks away, and if the Republicans are doing poorly as expected, they would be significantly weakened in their attempts to elect their husband to the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush seized the phone to call Senators and convince them to support Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush at the White House and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There is a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's still unclear whether Kavanaugh can secure at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to decide on a tie and confirm him for the Supreme Court.
Number of North Korean defectors ‘sinks’ under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean politician.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the South Korean Ministry of Reunification, said 1127 defectors were registered last year, up from 2706 in 2011.
Park called stricter border controls between North Korea and China, as well as higher prices for human smugglers, as the main factors.
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly about it.
The vast majority of defectors from the North will eventually be offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing over China, which has the longest border with North Korea, which is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Korean states.
China views the defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees, and often leads them back with violence.
Relations between the North and the South, which are technically still at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two heads of state met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the denuclearization negotiations.
This came as a result of the historic meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in June in Singapore, where they generally agreed to work on a denuclearized Korean peninsula.
On Saturday, however, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress.
“Without being able to trust the United States, we have no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to disarm unilaterally first,” Mir Ri said in a speech before the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and says he’s not fit for Supreme Court post
The minority leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, called Justice Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was "personally unfit" for the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made these comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t deny the impression that a woman who acted like this would have been called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when both were teenagers.
During his opening speech, Kavanaugh was very emotional; sometimes he almost screamed and was about to burst into tears as he talked about his family and his high school days.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee and called the allegations against him a “gross and coordinated reprisal” organized by liberals who were furious about Hillary Clinton’s 2016 lost presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh’s statement proves he can’t serve on the Supreme Court because it shows he is biased against Democrats.
"I believe that with these statements and the way he ruled over the Clintons and the Democrats, he himself has declared himself unfit," she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office should he be confirmed and the Democrats win the majority in the House of Representatives.
“I’m going to say so much: if he doesn’t tell Congress or the FBI the truth, then he’s not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but also for his current judgeship,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi said she was concerned as a Democrat about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion principle decision Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his hearings, Kavanaugh questioned whether he would review certain Supreme Court decisions.
“We don’t need a hysterical, biased person going to this court and expecting us to say, ‘Oh, that’s not wonderful,’” Pelosi said.
Women have to use it as a weapon.
It’s a sincere hate speech, months and years of overcooking anger and she can’t get it out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's rare, and you?"
She went on to say, “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she also cries when she gets angry, but developed a technique. When she gets angry and starts crying, she says to the person she was talking to, ‘You might think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then just keep talking.
I thought it was brilliant."
Tears are allowed as a valve for anger, in part because they are completely misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories is of a former job, in a male-dominated office, where one day I cried because of an indescribable anger and was picked up by an older woman, a chilled manager, who I was always a little afraid of, and pulled into a stairwell.
“Never let her see you cry,” she told me.
“They don’t know you’re stinky.
They think you’re sad and will be happy with yourself because they believe you’ve gone to the substance.”
Patricia Schroeder, then a congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Hart was caught aboard a ship called Monkey Business in an extramarital affair and then withdrew her candidacy, the deeply frustrated Schroeder thought there was no reason not to consider the idea of presidential candidacy herself.
“It wasn’t a well thought out decision,” she told me 30 years later with a laugh.
There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called the situation “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.”
Since the election campaign was already advanced, she was behind on fundraising and she vowed not to run if she wasn’t going to get $2 million together.
It was a hopeless struggle.
She found that some of her supporters, who donated $1,000 to men, only supported her campaign with $250.
“Do they think I’m getting a discount?” she asked.
In the speech in which she announced she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions, gratitude for her supporters, frustration over the system that made it so difficult for voters to raise funds and address them directly instead of the delegates, as well as the anger over sexism, that she was close to tears.
“You could have assumed that I suffered a nervous breakdown,” Schroeder recalls of the press reactions.
“You would have thought that the cloth manufacturer Kleenex was my sponsor.
I still remember wondering what they would write on my tombstone.
"Are you crying?"
Why Beijing could benefit from the US-China trade war
The opening salvos of the trade war between the US and China were deafening. Although the battle is far from over, Beijing could benefit from a trench between the countries in the long term, my experts.
Donald Trump, the U.S. president, fired the first warning shot earlier this year when he imposed punitive tariffs on key Chinese exports, including solar cells, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation this week came with new punitive tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods, effectively affecting half of all goods imported from China to the U.S.
Beijing retaliated in the same way each time and recently imposed punitive tariffs of five to ten percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond to any action by the US, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will soon crash.
To move Washington to condescension would be to give in, but a public condescension to the United States would be far too shameful for China’s President Xi Jinping.
Nevertheless, my experts believe that if Beijing plays its cards well, China could benefit from the long-term effects of the trade war by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact that a quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions for economic turbulence in both countries is actually much more dangerous than many observers have previously recognized,” says Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria 'ready' for return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and asks for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by the war for over seven years.
Speaking before the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country is improving.
“Today, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer,” he said.
The government is rebuilding the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions were now given for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have left the country since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that it would not accept conditional aid from countries that had supported the uprising.
Europe won the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup and defeated Team USA with a finish of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National near Paris.
The U.S. has now lost six consecutive times on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe won back the crown after the team of Danish captain Thomas Bjorn scored the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the US.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had problems over much of the tournament, sunk his tee on the 16th track (par 3) in the water and lost to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari was able to shine in all his rounds and became one of 4 players who scored a 5-0-0 since the tournament began in its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5:4 by the player with the lowest ranking in Team Europe, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The player with the world's best ranking, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to the Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia, a veteran of eight Ryder Cups, became the best European Ryder Cup player of all time with 25.5 career points.
“Normally I don’t cry, but today I couldn’t help myself.
It was a difficult year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I am so happy to win the cup back.
It’s about the team and I’m happy to have made a contribution,” said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He reaches the torch further to his compatriot John Rahm, who won against the American golf legend Tiger Woods on Sunday 2:1 in the individual meetings.
I’m so incredibly proud to have beaten Tiger Woods, whom I’ve been following on television since I was a kid,” Rahm said.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
A strange statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 important titles and is surpassed only by Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team had trouble finding the fairways all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who had high-profile performances throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance by his team: “I’m proud of the guys, they fought.
There was a time this morning when we had put Europe under pressure.
We didn't make anything out of it.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players performed well.
We’ll regroup, I’ll talk to the PGA America and our Ryder Cup committee and we’ll look ahead.
I love these 12 guys and I am proud to be their captain.
You have to pull the hat.
We were defeated."
