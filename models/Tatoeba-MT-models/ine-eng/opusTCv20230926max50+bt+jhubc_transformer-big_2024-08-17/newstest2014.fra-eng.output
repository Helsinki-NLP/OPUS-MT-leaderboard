Spectacular "wingsuit" jump over Bogota
Sportsman Jhonathan Florez jumped from a helicopter over Bogota, the Colombian capital, on Thursday.
Equipped with a wingsuit (a combination with wings), it passed at 160 km/h above the famous Monserrate sanctuary, located at more than 3,000 meters above sea level, where many Badauds had gathered to observe its feat.
A black box in your car?
While planners of the U.S. road network struggle to find the money needed to repair derelict highway infrastructure, many are seeing a solution in the form of a small black box that fixes itself above your car’s dashboard.
The devices, which record all the miles traveled by a motorist and pass the information to officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in government offices planning to overhaul the outdated system of financing major U.S. roads.
The generally uninterested sector of the planning of the major axes has suddenly provoked a lively debate and turbulent alliances.
Libertarians have joined environmental groups to lobby for the government to use small boxes to keep track of the miles you travel, and possibly the road you travel on, and then use the information to draft a tax bill.
The Tea Party has landed.
The American Civil Liberties Union is also very concerned and expresses its concern about the protection of privacy.
And while members of Congress are unable to agree on whether to continue, several states have not waited.
They are looking for how, over the next decade, they will be able to switch to a system that allows drivers to pay based on the number of miles traveled.
Thousands of motorists have already boarded these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for an experimental trip.
This is truly essential for our nation.
“It’s not like we have a choice,” said Hasan Ikhrata, director general of the Southern California Association of Governments, who predicts that the state will start recording the miles traveled by every Californian motorist by 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do that.
The pressure comes from the fact that the country’s Highway Trust Fund, funded with taxes that Americans pay at the pump, is financially dry.
Americans don't buy as much gasoline as they used to.
Cars can travel more than a mile with a gallon.
The federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents per gallon, has not increased in 20 years.
Politicians are reluctant to raise the tax, even by 1 cent, while gasoline prices are high.
“The gasoline tax is simply not sustainable,” said Lee Munnich, a transportation policy specialist at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently installed trackers on 500 cars to test a payment system per mile.
“This turns out to be the most logical long-term alternative,” he said.
Wonks calls this a mileage usage charge.
It is not surprising that the idea seduces city liberals, since taxes could be used to change driving habits so as to reduce congestion and gas emissions, for example.
California planners are interested in the system as they develop strategies to achieve the goals set out in the state’s ambitious laws on global warming.
But Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said he also sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
Supporters of the Reason Foundation’s free market also appreciate the idea of having drivers pay per mile.
“It’s not just a tax lurking in a big black hole,” said Adrian Moore, vice president of policy at the Reason Foundation.
People pay more directly for the benefits they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. Secretary of Transportation who, in a 2011 report, urged Congress to go the mile payment route.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that reportedly involved about 10,000 cars.
But the House presidency killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of rural legislators representing voters who must travel many miles every day to get to work or town.
However, several states and major cities are making progress on their side.
The most determined is Oregon, which has mobilized 5,000 drivers to lead the country's most important experience.
These motorists will soon pay the state mileage fees instead of gasoline taxes.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
The city of New York is considering one.
Illinois is trying a test on a limited number of trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes 17 agencies involved in road transportation in states along the U.S. east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Florida) is studying how it could implement change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where about 50 volunteer motorists recently equipped their car with a device, drivers were worried that the government could follow their every move.
“Worries about Big Brother and things like that are a big problem,” said Alauddin Khan, who heads the Nevada Department of Transportation’s strategic performance management.
It's not something that people want.
From the beginning of the trial, the Nevada ACLU warned on its site: “It would be relatively easy to turn these devices into full-fledged localization devices.”
There is no need to build a huge and cumbersome technological infrastructure that will inevitably be expanded to keep records of people’s daily commutes and arrivals.
Nevada is one of the few states that are now struggling to find affordable technology that would allow the state to know how many miles a car travels, but without knowing the exact location or time.
If we can do that, Khan added, citizens will be more comfortable.
The search for this technology has led some state agencies to call on a small California startup called True Mileage.
Originally, the company was not intended to help motorists who pay taxes to states.
She was looking to break into the emerging auto insurance market, where drivers would pay based on their mileage.
But the devices it tests have liked the planners of the major axes because they do not use GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
“People will be more inclined to do that if you don’t record their speed and locate them,” said Ryan Morrison, CEO of True Mileage.
Major mistakes have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are far less costly means and far less intrusive methods to proceed.
In Oregon, planners try the experience by offering drivers different choices.
They can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have a device at all, preferring instead to pay a package based on the average number of miles traveled by all state residents.
Other states hope to sell the concept to suspicious citizens by allowing the devices to do more, rather than not enough.
In New York City, transportation officials are looking to develop a charging device that would also be equipped to pay for parking fees, provide “pay-to-drive” insurance, and create a set of real-time speed data from other drivers that drivers could use to avoid traffic jams.
“Automakers would be encouraged to participate because of the benefits the system offers them,” said a document on urban planning.
However, some transport planners wonder whether the whole debate on mileage payment is not just a huge diversion.
At the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission, officials say Congress could very simply manage the Highway Trust Fund’s bankruptcy by raising taxes on gasoline.
An additional single or annual tax could be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of gasoline, so everyone pays their fair share.
“There’s no need to resort to radical surgery when you just need aspirin,” Randy Rentschler, the commission’s director of legislation and public affairs, said.
If we do that, hundreds of millions of motorists will worry about protecting their privacy and a lot of other things.
David Bowie: Four unreleased tracks
The English musician has not finished surprising this year.
From The Next Day, published in January, he has concocted a luxury reissue scheduled for November 4, with several new releases.
Four have already emerged on the web.
The announcement of the release of a new album by David Bowie had left everyone pantose.
On the day of his 66th birthday, January 8, 2013, he announced that a new album would be released in March.
After ten years of silence (the last record, Reality, dated 2003) and too few public appearances, the English musician proved that he could still be relied on to sparkle the pop scene.
A feast for his fans
Unsurprisingly, David Bowie had more than one lap in his bag with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke is set to re-release this album on November 4.
For the occasion, he made a real feast for his fans.
This reissue, titled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three discs: the original album, unreleased studio sessions and remixes, as well as a DVD containing the four clips already unveiled.
The Next Day Extra will contain a total of ten additional tracks compared to the original album: the three tracks of the Deluxe edition, five songs specially unveiled for the occasion, as well as two remixes.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful box in a video.
He introduces each of the discs, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and covers, a notebook to share his own prints, a booklet with lyrics...
And, above all, he gives a taste of his new Atomica title, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars far ahead and a skilfully mastered rock electricity.
Unreleased songs are already being listened to
But Atomica is not the only title to reveal its charms.
The Informer, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the web.
The Informer is double-faced: a disturbing intro before a light ride that slows down gradually to make way for a pop ballad.
On Like A Rocket Man, did Bowie want to make a small reference to Elton John’s Rocket Man, or even Gravity?
With this playful title, the singer seems at least in his element when he no longer has his feet on the ground.
Space Oddity, on the other hand, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie once again makes reference to his strangeness: would he come from another planet?
The guitar riffs, enchanting, make you want to leave the Earth.
In any case, Bowie has fun playing the chameleon with these titles: turn-by-turn informant, man on board a rocket, Martian potential...
He hides and reveals both, plays to adopt different personalities, as he has done throughout his career, notably with his characters Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wonder he has a mask in his hand in the photography of Louis Vuitton’s L’Invitation au Voyage campaign, of which he embodies the new face.
It will appear in one of their commercials, broadcast from November 10.
Defence Minister Rob Nicholson insisted that wounded soldiers were not summarily released from the Canadian Armed Forces, and stressed that a transition process was being followed by all soldiers before their return to civilian life.
Attacked by the Liberals and the New Democrats in the House of Commons, Mr. Nicholson ensured that prior to their release, members of the military were following a transition plan in collaboration with their superiors.
All wounded soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civilian life and none of them are released before they are ready, he said.
Detractors accuse the government of wanting to save money by not allowing injured military personnel - who do not meet the army's "universal service" rule requiring staff to be able to perform a variety of tasks - to reach the 10-year eligibility period required for retirement benefits.
They cited two cases reported by The Canadian Press, including that of a soldier released last Friday.
Corporal David Hawkins, a reservist in London, Ontario, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, was released from the army despite his request to stay another year in order to receive a fully indexed retirement.
His case came after that of Corporal Glen Kirkland, who told a parliamentary committee last month that he had been pushed to the exit before being ready because he did not meet the universality rule of service.
Mr. Hawkins stressed that a soldier could be prepared to leave, with plans and consultation sessions, but that this was totally different from wanting to leave the ranks.
“I told them I wasn’t ready,” he said in an interview with The Canadian Press on Wednesday.
I asked for months if there was a way for me to stay, and they said no.
Since the start of major fighting in Afghanistan, the military has struggled to determine what latitude it can give to wounded soldiers who want to stay in the ranks but who are not fit for combat.
Under current rules, severely injured soldiers have up to three years to recover.
If they do not meet the criteria for deployments abroad, they may be forced to leave the military.
Data presented to Parliament last year indicated that of the 1,218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the length of service required to obtain retirement benefits.
Former combatant liberal spokesman Jim Karygiannis called for Corporal Hawkins' reinstatement on Wednesday, while New Democrat Jack Harris called for an immediate end to "this shameful practice."
Disney Puts on Tablets to Launch Animated Series
The American media and entertainment group Disney has decided to privilege the tablets to its own television channels for the upcoming release of a new children's series.
The first nine episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available starting November 24 on watchdisneyjunior.com or via its mobile and tablet app.
Its worldwide launch on Disney Group channels is scheduled only in 2014, the statement of its Disney Junior division details.
The cartoon, intended for children from 2 to 7 years old, tells the adventures of the cat Callie, sheriff of a western American city where she makes order reign with a magical lasso.
Each episode includes two 11-minute stories.
“Interacting with smartphones and tablets is second nature to children today,” said Albert Cheng, vice president of digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group.
This type of experience is part of Disney’s efforts to “extend the lifespan of its series and build new relationships with its audience through digital platforms that are increasingly important,” he added.
A survey published earlier this week by Common Sense Media showed an explosion in the use of mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of children under the age of 2 have already used a tablet or phone, and 72% of children under the age of 8 years, compared to 10% and 38% two years ago, respectively.
Snowden ready to “cooperate” with Germany on US surveillance issue
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower for U.S. intelligence services, said he was willing to travel to Berlin to testify before the German parliament if the U.S. National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander did not provide answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele met on Thursday with Mr Snowden in Russia, where he enjoys the right of asylum, to discuss his testimony in Germany.
In a letter the MP presented to the media in Berlin on Friday, Mr Snowden said: “Although the result of my efforts has been clearly positive, my government continues to treat the difference of opinion as a leak and seeks to penalize political discourse with accusations against which it is impossible to defend itself.”
However, telling the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr. Snowden wrote that he thought the support of the international community could persuade the U.S. government to drop the criminal charges against him.
As part of the complaint filed by the U.S. Department of Justice, he is accused of espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Zeit Online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to German officials, we will make that possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have been severely strained following complaints that the NSA had tapped the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the MP who heads the parliamentary group overseeing foreign secret services, said that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness “without putting him in danger and completely ruining relations with the United States,” it should be taken advantage of.
Mr Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele, a German Green MP, posted a photo of himself with Mr Snowden on his Twitter account.
During his visit to Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr Str<0xC3><0xB6>bele said that according to the lawyer of the former NSA consultant, Mr Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Mr. Snowden was testifying in Germany, he should be assured that he would be “safe” there, the MP said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he was the subject of a “serious and sustained” persecution campaign that forced him to leave his country.
However, he said he had been encouraged by the global reaction to "my act of political expression."
Citizens around the world as well as senior officials – including in the United States – have judged the revelation of an inexplicable system of permanent surveillance to be of public utility.
The letter calls for an offer of cooperation with the German authorities “when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation have been resolved”.
Cogeco Cable could soon offer interactive TV
Cogeco Cable subscribers could well have access to apps like Facebook, Twitter and ultimately the Netflix on-demand video service via their TV in a future that doesn’t seem so far away.
The Cogeco subsidiary said Thursday that it is currently conducting preliminary beta testing of the platform with some of its users.
“This will allow us to showcase more user-friendly interfaces as well as more options,” Cogeco President and CEO Louis Audet said in an interview.
Cogeco Cable is thus taking the lead from its competitors, such as Bell, even though the Cogeco subsidiary does not yet have a precise date for this new platform.
“We have to adapt and change or resist change and fail,” Audet said.
The ultimate goal remains to offer tools that our customers do not currently have access to.
Telecommunication giant Rogers has already said it could offer Netflix if certain technical details, which were not mentioned, could be settled.
In the United States, the popular video service claims to be in discussions with some major cable distributors so that its service is available through their broadcast platforms.
Cogeco and Cogeco Cable also welcomed the announcement made by the Harper government during its Speech from the Throne on October 16.
Ottawa wants to force cable and satellite TV providers to offer customers the opportunity to pay for <0xC3><0xA0> la carte services.
“It’s been about two and a half years that we’ve been saying that the idea of forcing consumers to buy important chain packages doesn’t work,” Audet said.
He hoped, however, that the consultations conducted by the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) would lead to interesting recommendations.
"There will need to emerge from these discussions a kind of new frame of reference to define our new Canadian cultural policy with regard to television," Cogeco said.
The CRTC has been conducting public consultations since last week and is expected to continue with the industry next spring.
On the earnings side, Cogeco reported a net profit of $43.8 million in the fourth quarter, or 82<0xC2><0xA2> per share.
This is a decrease compared to the net profit of 44.9 million, or 83<0xC2><0xA2> per share, of the same period last year.
The Montreal-based company explains this decline in amortization costs related to new acquisitions.
In 2012, Cogeco acquired the U.S.-based cable company Atlantic Broadband for $1.36 billion.
This was the first major acquisition of the company after the one that failed in Portugal.
Last December, the Montreal-based company also purchased Peer 1 Network Enterprises, a Vancouver-based Internet provider, for $526 million.
As for Cogeco’s revenues, they grew by 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
This is $1.8 billion for the current fiscal year.
The net profit of its main subsidiary, Cogeco Cable, was 43.9 million, or 90<0xC2><0xA2> per share, down from 45.7 million, or 93<0xC2><0xA2> per share, in the same period last year.
Cogeco Cable’s revenues, however, rose 45% to reach 470.4 million.
The company lost 15,237 customers in the fourth quarter.
However, for the financial year 2013, the number of Cogeco Cable customers increased by 5546.
Mr. Audet is not worried about seeing the number of customers fluctuate in this way.
For me, this is not an indication of a change in trend, he observed.
It varies from one quarter to the next with very fierce competition.
From horse in products to beef
Horse meat has been found in cans of beef-based products, sold by two small British low-priced retailers, the agency in charge of food hygiene announced today.
Routine tests revealed that the products, developed in January in Romania and sold by the chains Home Bargains and Quality Save, contained horse DNA in the amount of 1 to 5%.
"As horse meat is not mentioned in the ingredients list, it should not have been present in the product," the agency said.
A scandal over the presence of horse meat in cooked dishes broke out in Europe earlier this year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to European Commission reviews, France was the country most affected by the presence of this type of meat in products supposed to contain only beef.
A collision between two vehicles injured four people early Friday on Route 131 in Lanaudi<0xC3><0xA8>re.
Shortly before 4 a.m., a motorist driving north, in Saint-Félix-de-Valois, lost control of his vehicle and hit a car coming in the other direction.
The four occupants of the two vehicles were injured, but there was no fear for their lives.
Traffic had returned to normal around 6 a.m. on Friday.
Frontier Airlines plans to pay for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for passengers carrying carry-on baggage on its flights.
Frontier Airlines plans to start charging up to $100 for a carry-on and $2 for a coffee or soda, though in its announcement Wednesday, it indicated that passengers could take the unopened can with them on the plane’s descent.
The new carry-on baggage charges relate to bags stored in the upper compartment, so small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said it would charge $25 if fees were paid in advance and $100 if travelers only paid once at the boarding gate.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 was planned to encourage travelers to pay the fees in advance.
“We don’t want to make this price pay,” she explained.
The airlines started to pay for the first and second checked baggage in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these charges put as much stuff as they could into hand luggage stored in the upper compartments, so there was often no more room in those compartments.
These fees are a way to ensure that passengers carry less stuff on board.
O'Malley said that these new fees will not really be used to raise money.
It’s about making Frontier’s most loyal customers understand that it’s becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the upper compartments.
Passengers who purchase their tickets on the airline’s website will not have to pay.
Thus, a passenger queued at a Frontier boarding gate could carry a bag for free, while the next person in the queue might have to pay $100 for a similar bag.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and check-in procedures are changing to ensure passengers are aware of these charges before arriving at the door.
Frontier’s carry-on baggage charges will not be applied until the summer, although no date has been set.
Passengers often sneeze about baggage and other charges, but airlines love them.
They believe that baggage handling costs are high and that passengers who want this service should pay for it.
Many people on Wall Street consider the addition of baggage fees as a sign that airlines are paying high enough to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
Yet many of them have not touched the cost of luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand luggage fees three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such a fee is the Hungarian airline Wizz Air, said airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely follows the surcharge.
He estimated, in a December 2011 report, that Spirit’s carry-on baggage cost $50 million per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines executive, recently traveled on Spirit and wondered what he would find at the boarding gate at the time passengers would discover the company’s unusual carry-on baggage charges.
“I had never seen such a smooth boarding procedure in my entire professional career,” he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and a fight breaking out at the door.
The plane was full, he added, “passengers are on board at lightning speed.”
Frontier also does as Spirit and charges a $2 fee for a coffee, tea, soda, or fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a soda or fruit juice can take the unopened can with them, and those who take coffee can be served for free.
It will always distribute water for free.
US Airways briefly attempted to charge for the drinks in 2008 but came back seven months later after passengers complained and when no other major airline had followed.
Frontier's decision to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not purchase their ticket directly from the airline is its last effort to encourage customers to go to its site.
Airlines pay online travel sellers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each ticket sold.
This has prompted all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly from them instead of contacting an online travel agency.
However, Frontier has gone further in this area.
In September, it began offering only half a mile of loyalty to customers who bought their ticket through an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, it reduced mileage premiums by 25% on a trip.
For example, a 1,000-mile Frontier trip purchased from an online travel agency would earn 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat in advance only if they purchase their ticket directly on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base in her hometown of Denver, but her business is shrinking and she is losing money.
Revenue fell 9% and its flight capacity declined almost 13% in the first quarter, according to financial results released Wednesday by its parent company, Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to fix Frontier's finances by selling the airline.
The NSA calls into question an “internal error” and not hackers for the failure of its website
The National Security Agency working in the shadows said Friday that it was a bug that had caused its public site to crash for a few hours, and not hackers as some had claimed online.
“NSA.gov remained inaccessible for a few hours tonight due to an internal error that occurred during a scheduled update,” the spy agency said in an emailed statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
Allegations that the failure was due to a distributed denial-of-service (DSO) attack are false.
Earlier tonight, online server trackers noted that the NSA site had been down for at least 6 hours, and some users still can’t access the site.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency’s sensitive internal network was “not at all” compromised.
No classified information is in danger, the spokesman said.
At least one group of online hacktivists claimed responsibility for the breakdown of the NSA site by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks aim to flood a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses.
Cyber-tactics are not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the targeted system.
The formerly top-secret NSA, a time known as the “No Such Agency,” has found itself under the spotlight and heavily criticized in recent months following a wave of revelations about its vast communications surveillance programs at home and abroad – which are part of the NSA’s secret files stolen from the agency and leaked to the NSA.
This growing controversy around the agency has sparked much speculation that the incident tonight was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The Delta City Centre is now closed
The Delta Centre-Ville hotel closed its doors Thursday in Montreal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that owned the building sold it to promoters who will turn it into student residences.
Three hundred and fifty people worked at the hotel.
Of these, 200 have still not found a new job.
Delta promises not to drop its employees.
Employers came to meet employees directly on site, and employees were individually met to assess their needs.
“This support will continue for the next six months,” said Felix Bisson, Regional Director of Labor Relations at Delta Hotels.
The closure of the Delta is taking place in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that owned that building had choices to make.
Either he reinvested in the building to continue operating it, so there were investments of tens of millions while the competition is very fierce, there are many new hotels that have appeared in Montreal.
“Or he was selling it to someone else and that’s what happened,” says Paul Arsenault, chair of Transat Tourism at the UQAM School of Management Sciences.
Other Montreal hotels will also be converted in the coming months, such as the Crown Plaza, which will become a residence for the elderly.
In the meantime, four hotel projects totaling nearly 600 rooms will be launched within two years.
Titan CEO Says “Goodyear Amiens Purchase Project Starts With Zero Employee”
After tossing the sponge with a bang in January for the partial resumption of the North Amiens Goodyear site promised to close, Maurice Taylor, the CEO of the American tire company Titan, today declared himself ready to save 333 jobs out of the 1,137 that the plant counts.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Productive Recovery, had already announced this on Monday, October 21.
After giving up the plant’s purchase project in January, you’re back today.
You spoke of violent attacks and insults, speaking of “supposed workers”, who “work three hours” a day, of “wrong” unions, targeting the CGT.
We don't understand this flip-flop.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to please anyone.
Except for my wife.
Mr. Montebourg is a charming young man trying to save some of the highest-paid industrial jobs.
If I hurt anyone with my words, I'm sorry.
But France has a high level of tax and unemployment as well.
Does the truth hurt you?
Work seven hours a day when in other countries you work eight hours handicap France.
In India, China and many other countries, we work ten to twelve hours a day.
But I don't have any prejudices about France.
What I see is a factory that makes good agricultural tires, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to expand.
Why does Titan need this factory so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this factory.
But, with the right price and skilled workers, this is worth a try.
What kind of agreement do you expect between the CGT and Goodyear?
If Goodyear had offered employees a good starting compensation since the plant was announced, I think 100% of employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan buys the closed factory from Goodyear.
From there, Titan could move the machines to Poland or any other European Union country that still has its own currency.
I think Mr Montebourg knows that.
Now, he wants to keep the Amiens plant with at least 333 well-paid jobs.
Titan agrees to recruit them from Goodyear’s approximately 1,200 current employees.
So Mr. Montebourg needs a commitment from Titan before trying to get the CGT to sit down at the table with Goodyear.
The first step is for the CGT and Goodyear to enter into an agreement on severance pay for all employees.
As a result, there will be no more employees in the factory.
Mr. Montebourg said you were ready to secure these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm that?
The only number I mentioned to the minister is 333.
I know he'd want a four-year guarantee.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting compensation.
If all employees accept them, the project to purchase the plant starts with zero employees.
How can we give guarantees of duration of employment when there are no more employees left on the site?
If Mr Montebourg gets the CGT and Goodyear to agree and Titan buys the plant, we intend to stay in Amiens-Nord for more than four years.
Bombardier’s profit falls as deliveries and aircraft orders fall
Bombardier Inc., a Canadian aeronautical and rail manufacturer, reported a 15% decline in its net profit on Thursday, under pressure from lower orders and deliveries of aircraft during the third quarter and contractual issues in its Trains division.
Montreal-based Bombardier has also not provided flight test data for its all-new CSeries aircraft or information on whether the aircraft will meet its ambitious commercial commissioning schedule before September next year.
After the inaugural flight of the test aircraft about a month and a half ago, the latter flew only three times, and the question then arose whether the test phase was on track.
The results were not up to expectations and the share price fell by 8% on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating on Thursday, moving from “overperformance” to “sector performance” due to the low potential for the stock market to rise in the next quarter or two.
“Although the decline in aircraft deliveries was largely anticipated, we are really disappointed by the profit margin in the Transport division,” Doerksen said in a customer note.
We believe Bombardier will record new orders for its CSeries aircraft as the flight testing program progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries family of aircraft will be able to catapult it into the lower segment of a market today dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was unveiled in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay.
But the number of firm orders for CSeries aircraft is so far modest at 177. It seems that potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests to validate the company's claims regarding the energy efficiency and savings potential of the new airliner.
At present, the company has registered a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments from 15 customers and operators.
Pierre Beaudoin, President and Chief Executive Officer, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 firm orders before the commercial commissioning of the first aircraft.
Leaders also reassured analysts and the media on Thursday by telling them that the program was moving ahead according to schedule.
“The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected,” Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were scheduled during the plane’s downtime.
Each manufacturer plans in a different way.
We decided to make a first flight and schedule an update period, and that's what we did.
This will be repeated throughout the flight program.
The second of the five test aircraft is expected to take off in the coming weeks, the others will follow shortly after, the company said.
Still, analysts are skeptical that the first customer could fly a CSeries aircraft just 12 months after its maiden flight.
Bombardier has indicated that it is evaluating the start-up schedule and will provide new information in the coming months.
“This slow flight testing – although apparently in line with Bombardier’s internal schedule – reinforces our view that entry into service will be pushed back to the first quarter of 2015,” Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ended September 30, Bombardier’s net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings per share remained unchanged at 9 cents.
Revenues fell slightly from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts expected earnings of 10 cents per share and revenues of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world’s fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer said it delivered 45 aircraft during the quarter, up from 57 a year earlier.
Net orders fell to 26 aircraft, compared to 83 previously.
The delay in the Aeronautics division was $32.9 billion as of September 30, a figure unchanged from December 31 of the previous year.
“In Aeronautics, the results were in line with our forecast, but the low number of orders and general market conditions were disappointing,” Beaudoin said.
Aeronautics revenues fell by 13% to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world’s largest rail manufacturer, said revenue for the division had risen nearly 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The Transportation division's order book totaled $32.6 billion as of September 30, a slight increase from December 31 of the previous year.
The margins of the Transport division have suffered from performance problems concerning a few large contracts.
Leaders announced that new guidance would be provided during the fourth quarter.
The Bombardier stock price, which also announced that Patrick Pichette, chief financial officer of Google Inc, would be on the board, fell 8.5 percent to C$4.83 in the afternoon on Thursday.
Brazil’s Embraer SA, the world’s third-largest aeronautical manufacturer and closest competitor to Bombardier, reported a 10% decline in its quarterly profit on Thursday.
Two 23- and 27-year-old speleologists had been missing in a ditch under the Tooth of Crolles since Thursday night, it was learned Friday from the Speleo rescue of Is<0xC3><0xA8>re.
They were located this Friday afternoon.
The two men, one adept at practice and the other not, had gone underground on Thursday at about 9:30 p.m. to make a crossing of the Dent de Crolles, located in the commune of Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse.
We have not heard from them since then, the same source said.
"The speleologists should have come out around 5 a.m.," said Thierry Larribe, technical adviser at the Speleo Relief in charge of the relief organization.
Dozens of people on site
About twenty rescuers, ten civilians members of the Spéléo French rescue, as well as gendarmes, CRS and firefighters were on site.
At the end of the afternoon this Friday, the two speleologists were located.
"It is another group of speleologists who, after finding them exhausted but healthy in the cavity, passed the information to one of the rescue teams involved in the network," explains Le Dauphiné.
The two soldiers in the 13th Battalion of the Chambéry Alpine Hunters were found "exhausted, but not injured".
They got lost in the network, went back on their feet waiting for help, the prefecture said.
Refueled, they should come out of the cavity with the help of rescuers in the evening.
German journalists invited to flee Google and Yahoo
The trade union of German journalists on Thursday invited its members to stop using the online services of Google and Yahoo in the wake of new revelations about the activities of the US and British intelligence services.
“The German Federation of Journalists recommends that journalists avoid using the search engines and messaging services of Google and Yahoo until further notice,” she said in a statement.
It found the Washington Post’s information “scandalous,” according to which the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) have collected masses of information by infiltrating international networks that allow the two firms to synchronize their servers.
"The searches carried out by journalists are as confidential as the contact details of their sources and the nature of their communications with them," said Michael Konken, president of the union that claims 38,000 members.
Fires repainted: a member of parliament requests the resignation of Brigitte Grouwels
Minister Brigitte Grouwels’ project of “relifting” signalling poles in Brussels does not appeal to everyone.
As a reminder, the Brussels Minister of Public Works and Transport launched a test project this Thursday in the centre of Brussels consisting of repainting 16 signalling poles of the region in yellow and blue colors of Brussels.
The aim is to "increase security" and "Brussels identity".
The idea is, in the long run, to repaint all the Brussels traffic lights, for an estimated cost of about one million euros.
But the blue chosen by the minister is "too dark", according to Brussels MP Emmanuel De Bock who talks about the "flamandisation" of the capital and demands the "resignation" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"Not content with foolishly spending the money of the Brusselsers in the operations of lifting the signalling poles in the colors of the Brussels Region, Brigitte Grouwels continues her operations of Flemishization of the Capital," De Bock said in a statement.
After her yellow-mango-black taxis, she finally repainted herself in dark blue-yellow-black the poles of Brussels.
According to the MP, there is now "no more difference in visual continuity between Flanders and Brussels".
The people of Brussels deserve better than to see their money wasted by a CD&V minister who carries out the NVA program herself.
It is high time to stop the Trojan horse of Flanders.
"For the record, Brigitte Grouwels was only elected with 2,245 votes, or 0.5% of the Brussels population!" concludes Mr. De Bock.
the Portico of Pont-de-Buis
The portico ecotaxe of Pont-de-Buis, around which a violent demonstration of opponents of this tax took place on Saturday, was dismantled Thursday morning.
Cranes arrived on the scene shortly after 10 a.m., and traffic on the national highway was diverted in the wake.
The decision to dismantle, announced by the prefecture of Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re on Wednesday, was made by the company Ecomouv, manager of the portico.
It is the last of the three ecotaxe porticoes in the state to operate in the Finist<0xC3><0xA8>re department, the other two having been dismantled or sabotaged.
Launch of an accessory store for Google Glass
An online store, offering multiple accessories dedicated to Google Glass, has just been made available to thousands of developers with a prototype of Google’s signed connected glasses.
They can thus acquire a headset, a charger or even a storage case.
This store, strictly reserved for developers who already have Google Glass, offers some accessories such as a charger and its USB cable, for $50.
For the same price, it is also possible to purchase a protective cover made of micro-fibers or an in-ear earphone.
Although Google is currently working on a Google Glass model equipped with corrective lenses, no large-scale marketing date has yet been confirmed.
Five years ago, my father disappeared from the world of the living.
At first I denied his death, I was talking about him in the present,
I was so afraid to forget it or rather I didn’t know how I was going to continue to “visit” it.
There is no recipe, no way to go through the wall of the invisible and find yours.
Then signs appeared.
The first time it was the very strong feeling of his presence in the passenger seat while I was driving.
Another time, a sweet awakening in the middle of the night to look at his watch that never leaves me, laid on the bedside table.
It is the image of my smiling father that accompanies me in my daily actions.
Our mother left us after her exhausting battle with cancer.
At least that's what I thought the day I found her body empty, squeezing on this hospital bed with crumpled sheets.
Likewise, his funeral was a glacial farewell focused around the meager glow of the candles that would frame his coffin.
I thought she was gone.
Gradually, through small daytime or nighttime apparitions, a little shy, a little erased, she quickly returned to my mind, evolving as she took her place in the landscape of my thought that was believed to be in mourning.
And then, she revealed herself while revealing to me my own facets that I had not yet perceived, masked by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I had by no means lost my mother’s person but simply a woman I didn’t really know, a woman who embodied that person, during her lifetime.
In dying, this woman had perfected her life and freed the person I loved, and here I found her, full and whole.
This detour from the path of my life remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It is a privilege to know that loved ones never leave us.
I look like my father, "inside and out," it seems.
I've always been told.
I never believed it at the time.
I had a difficult relationship with him until he got old, sick.
There, I was no longer afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he died.
For a long time, he accompanied me: when I stopped smoking, when I was afraid, when I was in pain...
He talked to me, encouraged me constantly, inhabited my body.
I saw his hands looking at mine, I lent him my body.
But it was never indiscreet.
I could have had a personal life.
He left me my privacy.
It took a long time and then one day he left.
Finally, it was comfortable and reassuring to be understood, encouraged, advised.
I no longer know who said that the dead are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are no longer there, but I constantly feel them close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feel their presence because I always refer to them: what would they have said? what would they have thought? what would they have done?
I constantly dream of them, maybe not every night but several times a week it is certain.
I often dream of the last moments that I have to share with them before it is too late, only there is always one thing that prevents me from accomplishing this moment.
I often wake up anxious when it happens to me and I feel deeply their absence.
Sometimes, some dreams carry me to the contrary and fit into my story and indeed, they continue to live and share my life.
On the eve of my ultrasound where I had to know the sex of my baby, I dreamed that I was waking up, I was getting out of bed, my father was waiting for me on the landing and he was smiling at me and was glad that I was waiting for a little boy.
The next day, I felt that he had visited me in my sleep to mean that he was happily sharing what was happening to me.
And of course, it was a little boy in my belly.
I loved sharing this moment with him and I take pleasure in sharing this common memory lived after his death.
Exactly five years ago, my grandmother died of cancer.
A year ago, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That is to say the shock that his disappearance caused in the young bachelor that I was at the time.
I realized my grief pretty quickly.
But it continues to influence my life, especially when I find myself in trouble, or when I have to make important decisions.
Learning Arabic and becoming interested in the Middle East, to the point of becoming a master in a large school, have not been, with hindsight, anodyne choices.
In fact, I often heard her speak Arabic in my childhood, and talk about Morocco, where she had lived for decades – before returning to France at the time of independence.
The values she instilled in me are still present, so I sometimes think about how she would like me to act at some point.
The same goes for my attitudes: I try to live up to the generosity and uprightness of the one who was a fervent believer.
Now I feel it as a daily presence, a benevolent soul, a saving spirit.
I can see his eyes resting on me.
My mother died nineteen years ago now.
He died after talking to me on the phone.
I have gone through all the phases: incomprehension, anger, pain, tears that are triggered alone, anywhere, anytime, in unusual places, incongruous moments.
Then time calmed the pain.
All that remained was the lack, the void without response, the need for her, to confide in me, to reassure me in the depths of her softness.
Yet, she is there, silent presence, she is there and looking at me.
Every morning, I see his worried eyes laying on me, I see the dark circles that make his eyes heavy, the wrinkles around the lips that dig cigarettes, the folds that mark the forehead on the days of worry.
My mother took possession of my face and she looks at me every morning in my mirror.
And every morning, I turn my eyes away.
My wife and the mother of my three children died of cancer at the age of 43.
We constantly feel his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, so we gradually learned to smile, and to pronounce his name is no longer taboo but a comfort.
Of course, I talk to her in the middle of the night when the absence hurts too much, she invites herself into my dreams when the morale is a little reached.
We feel carried away and protected in the difficult moments, the decline of time makes us realize how much she was a conductor and we try to stay in the path she had laid out for us.
If a being has loved you very much, the absence cannot take it away from your heart and memories.
In a way, being loved becomes your inner energy.
I lost my father on August 22, 2008 as a result of asbestos cancer.
I was very close to him, I always acted according to what he thought or what he liked.
I could not attend his burial and three weeks after his death, I gave birth to a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from his, I always wonder if my actions are consistent with his vision of things.
I have had problems with my work because of these beliefs.
For me, it is impossible to go in the opposite direction, I do not sleep and I always wonder what he will think of it.
I don’t know if I adopted his way of being or if I’m just like him: is it genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a bit like an alter-ego, there was no need to talk to each other.
In short, he is there on a daily basis.
I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
It has been almost thirty years since my husband died at the age of 33.
I was 28 years old and our son was 6 years old.
The immense pain that then invaded me has of course eased but it is still close to me.
Very often it "lands" in my dreams in such a precise way, so alive that when I wake up I am even sadder to find that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I was okay, I said no, he answered "I'm going down" but in a voice so real that I woke up in shock, anxious and I lit the bedside lamp looking everywhere, convinced that it was going to happen.
I still live in the same house, and often, I feel observed and I turn to see if he is not there, I know it is him and I talk to him.
In every room I feel his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and or his spirit lives with me.
I am 58 years old, I have always lived alone since his departure, he is and will remain the love of my life.
I want to clarify that I am sociable with a profession of responsibility, I laugh and I sing, I go out, I am a grandmother, I have a lot of friends, but my heart and soul belong to him and I never talk about him except with my son, and I never go to the cemetery.
Iraq: October was the bloodiest month since 2008
October was the deadliest month in Iraq since April 2008.
Baghdad released official figures Friday: 964 people lost their lives last month: 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers.
This publication takes place on the day when the Iraqi Prime Minister is received by the American President.
Noury al-Maliki wants help from the United States.
“We don’t tell the world to stand with us and support us, we have the right to ask the world for it because we are part of it,” Al-Maliki said Thursday in Washington.
And also because if what is happening in Iraq is not settled, it is going to expand, and what is happening in Syria is going to expand as well.
And what happens when a virus of terrorism lives? it spreads.
Noury al-Maliki was speaking at the United States Institute for Peace, an independent institution created by Congress.
Outside the building, protesters were protesting against the Iraqi leader.
They were waving signs accusing him, among other things, of being a murderer and calling on the United States to refuse to provide him with help.
Cocaine Lawyer Who Informed a Drug Sponsor of a Police Investigation Has Been Imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction would be revealed in broad daylight.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Court of Assizes.
A senior defense lawyer, who briefed a drug lord on a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction would be revealed, has been sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave sensitive information to crime lord Neil Scarbrough about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after he compromised because of his habit of using cocaine.
The lawyer, who was nicknamed "Bash" and considered by the criminals as a "matter of first importance", was arrested at his home in 2011 following police wiretapping operations directed at Scarborough, which he had represented at a previous drug trafficking trial.
Police officers spotted 32-year-old Sarborough depositing three bags of cocaine at the lawyer's home in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was attending a Bar dinner with colleagues.
Investigations revealed that Ditta was a “regular user” of this class A drug after tests showed traces of cocaine in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he sought to illegally obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his associates.
The four suspects were being monitored by police as part of a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire counties.
Together with 32 other men, they were subsequently imprisoned after police seized heroin and cocaine for an amount of <0xC2><0xA3>1.5m, as well as over <0xC2><0xA3>200,000 in cash during a series of raids.
Ditta, 42, was providing information to criminals because he feared his addiction would be revealed in broad daylight.
Today, at the Liverpool Court of Assizes, Ditta, who works at the Forbes Solicitors law firm in Blackburn, was disgraced after being found guilty on two counts of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial.
He had admitted possession of cocaine at a previous hearing.
The lawyer’s fall came after police, investigating Scarborough, discovered he had been in regular phone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and spotted him arriving at Ditta's home and placing 60% of the drugs under the lawyer's trash in a black golf glove.
Shortly after the deposit, Scarborough was regularly in telephone contact with Ditta who was at a dinner at the Ewood Park football stadium, pregnant with the Blackburn Rovers club.
The lawyer went home, discovered the drug, and they called each other nine times.
The court heard that Ditta was a “regular user” of cocaine after tests showed traces of this class A drug in her hair, on her wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied using cocaine, saying he had spoken to the alleged drug dealer because he was his client and argued that their discussions were subject to a "legal privilege."
During her arrest, Ditta picked up her wallet and tried to withdraw several credit cards, but they were all seized and a hair sample was taken from her.
During an interrogation, he stated that he had an office at his home, as well as at his workplace, and that it happened that clients were calling him at his home for legal matters.
But the court heard testimony that it was calling major players in the drug trade, some of whom it had represented, after key arrests to tell them which investigators were aware.
Attorney Anne Whyte said, “If anyone needs to know that you shouldn’t break the law, they’re a criminal lawyer.”
Mr. Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal lawyer, and of being too involved with private clients.
The relationship we are talking about is not just a drug dealer, but a drug dealer supplying drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of his communications will undoubtedly be legitimate communications because it was his lawyer.
But this has gone far beyond the ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He obstructed the police investigation as much as he could to allow him to continue his criminal activities.
Mr. Ditta has not honored his profession, but has dishonored it.
He got too close to some customers, particularly Scarborough, and let his independence be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and said, “If I was a corrupt lawyer, which I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr. Scarborough, I wouldn’t have waited 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the Lancashire Police said, “Mr. Ditta went from criminal to criminal lawyer himself as soon as he started getting drugs from criminal organizations.”
His addiction to cocaine compromised him forever and made him vulnerable to the backlash of the leading members of organized crime groups who tasked him with obtaining valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers should adhere to the strictest integrity rules and establish a climate of trust with the public.
Mr. Ditta betrayed that trust and tried to hide behind the veneer of his profession.
Lancashire's Serious and Organised Crime Unit conducted the investigation of Mr. Ditta, who was found guilty of the three counts of possession of cocaine and now of obstructing justice, testifying to his commitment to prosecute criminals.
That this case serves as a warning to criminals so they know that no one is above the law.
We will find you and bring you to court.
Scarborough himself was jailed for 14 years after pleading guilty to complicity in heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other people involved in the trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years in prison for drug trafficking.
On her website, Ditta organized a question/answer session about himself during which he said that his dream job would be to be a lawyer to represent clients in the death row in America, his last dinner guest would be Mohammed Ali and inequality would be what would motivate him to work.
Aretha Franklin to return to the stage in December
The Detroit News reports that the Queen of Soul will take place on December 21 at the Sound Board room of the MotorCity Casino hotel.
In November, Franklin recorded an album for Clive Davis and Sony Music, produced by Don Was and Kenny "Babyface" Edmonds.
Without specifying the disease she was suffering from, the famous interpreter of Respect had told the media on October 16 that the side effects of a treatment she was receiving were "difficult".
She says she's "happy to be back".
Menton reduces the cost of his Christmas lights
420 patterns, 2.2 kilometers of seashore covered with a coat of light: one could check the heat stroke in Menton with the bill of illuminations.
Invoice, which, unlike many municipalities, is additionally settled by taxpayers, and not by merchant associations.
To reduce its costs, the city uses LEDs.
But also a differentiated management of the network of public lighting and Christmas decorations.
Los Angeles Airport Evacuated After Shooting
A shooting took place at Los Angeles International Airport.
It was 10:00 a.m. local time when a man opened fire.
According to local police, at least two people were injured.
This would be an employee working for the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the author of the shots.
The incident would have occurred at terminal 3, causing a wave of panic.
Travelers and staff rushed to the exits or onto the tarmac.
Soon the police intervened and a man suspected of being the shooter was apprehended on the roof of an airport parking lot.
The airport is being evacuated and air traffic is disrupted.
Classical Singing for Teenagers
Each time, it is the school clientele who will be targeted, an initiative that had been very successful during the previous season.
Through five syllables imagined and performed by artists from the region, vignettes with a high dose of humor, teenagers are allowed to tame classical singing.
In addition to this show, the Lyrical Art Society of the Kingdom will return with its Lyrical Destinations, a formula that now makes room for the Pulperie de Chicoutimi.
Two more concerts will take place in the summer of 2014, giving artists in the region the chance to show what they are capable of.
In addition to these activities was the Apéro lyrique, the benefit concert held last August, with the competition of the soprano coloring Marie-<0xC3><0x88>ve Munger.
It was a profit-making activity, parallel to the artistic dimension, and it helped the non-profit to produce a financial balance sheet that is as soft to the ears as a bat’s air.
Without providing precise figures, the chairman of the board, Yves Bergeron, took advantage of the press meeting held yesterday in Chicoutimi, to be reassuring.
Despite the precariousness that is the lot of so many cultural institutions, the future looks good, even in the long term.
We have stronger and more consistent support.
“Finance is on the rise and we hope to last until the 50th anniversary of the operetta, a milestone that we will pass in seven years,” he said.
"I'd even say beyond that," added CEO Hél<0xC3><0xA8>ne Gaudreault, smiling.
The 37-year-old man who took a child hostage at the Gabrielle Roy School in Surrey faces six charges, according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Omar Moustapha Hassan has been charged with hostage-taking, kidnapping, threatening, carrying a weapon in a dangerous design, kidnapping, and failing to comply with an order.
“The rapid reactions of the police officers involved and their ability to immediately de-escalate the situation were essential to the safe conclusion of this incident,” said Col. Bert Paquet in a statement.
Omar Hassan is still in custody and will have to appear in court on Friday.
New request for a collective appeal against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new class action lawsuit has been filed against the Holy Cross brothers, concerning sexual assaults that allegedly took place this time in the St. Joseph's Oratory as well as in several orphanages, colleges and schools.
The application is based on the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J.", who was allegedly masturbated in the 1950s, first at Notre-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher Brother Submis, then by his confessor, Father Bernard, at the Oratory of Saint-Joseph, where he was serving as a mass servant and where his work was performed as a priest.
The first appeal was only for three institutions, and when the settlement was announced, many people told us, "I was at such a place, can I register?", says lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends the victims in both appeals.
The particularity of the class action that has just been filed is to allow the addition of complainants from any institution where abuse could have been perpetrated by members of the congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At present, the appeal brings together the complaints of 25 people who claim to have been assaulted by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The alleged facts are generally older than those mentioned in the first appeal, since many of the establishments concerned closed their doors in the 1960s.
The appeal also points out that the Congregation of St. Croix and the Oratory of St. Joseph, which is a separate entity, "allowed sexual abuse against children", that they "exercised a moral, religious and psychological constraint on the victims", and that they "had sexual abuse against the victims", and that they "were guilty of sexual abuse".
These latter accusations are based, among other things, on letters written by the Sainte-Croix brothers' lawyer, Me <0xC3><0x89>mile Perrin, in the 1990s, but also on the research done in the archives on this subject by Brother Wilson Kennedy, a former brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly denounced the abuse.
The class action must first pass the admissibility stage in the Superior Court.
Once admissibility has been accepted by the Court, the second stage is the substantive hearings.
In the case of the first appeal, the congregation of Sainte-Croix had agreed to settle the matter amicably before hearings were held on the merits.
A Major Fire in a Business
A fire severely damaged a business in the borough of LaSalle, Montreal, on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The rescues were called around 1 a.m. on Friday, due to a fire that had broken out in the basement of an Indian-style restaurant on Dollard Avenue, near the intersection with Réjane Street.
Thirty firefighters who were dispatched to the scene took nearly an hour to master the brazier.
The fire "caused significant damage to the structure of the building," said Richard Bordeaux, chief of operations for the Montreal Fire Safety Service.
The cause of the fire was unknown, but there was no one at the restaurant when the firefighters arrived on the scene.
There were no injuries, but nearly twenty homes, located on the first and second floors of this row of commercial premises, had to be evacuated.
The Red Cross has been requested, as residents of one of the apartments may have to be temporarily accommodated, the SIM said.
A lot of opposition to medical help dying in the Congress of palliative care
The Canadian Congress on Palliative Care, which is taking place this week in Ottawa, comes a few days after the vote in favor of the principle of the bill on medical aid to die in Quebec.
This is an opportunity for several palliative care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all patients had access to effective care to alleviate their suffering, in addition to being able to stay at home, very few of them would want to end their days, according to a spokeswoman for the Canadian Palliative Care Association, Maryse Bouvette.
If the focus was on palliative care in Canada, the approach to euthanasia would be minimal.
The president of the Quebec Palliative Care Network also rejected the bill on medical assistance in dying.
If adopted, Alberte Déry worries about the consequences for the next generations.
“What is the meaning of life,” she laments.
The majority of palliative care homes will refuse to help patients die, according to the vice president of the Alliance of Palliative Care Homes, Suzanne Fitzback.
Ms. Fitzback, also director of the house Mathieu-Froment-Savoie in Gatineau, believes that the service would be useless anyway.
We are never asked, “I want to die, give me an injection.”
The Director of the Ontario Palliative Care Association, Rick Firth, believes that the Quebec bill is confusing people about the purpose of palliative care.
He does not believe that Ontario will take the step.
For her part, Gatineau’s Liberal MP, Stéphanie Vallée, says that the concept of the end of life will have to be clarified before the bill is passed.
Kenyan press indignant over controversial media law
“It’s a scary country and it’s legitimate to ask the question: what will prevent Parliament from sweeping away the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?” the paper said, challenging the bill and calling for it to be declared unconstitutional.
“This law is draconian and very punitive, and we reject it,” said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group – owner of CapitalFM, one of Kenya’s most respected independent news and radio stations.
He said the new media court “will always be biased because it is an extension of the government” and that restrictions on content and advertising would hurt Kenya’s place in the global economy.
“I hope the president will listen to us, and we are asking him to reject this bill and send it back to parliamentarians,” he said.
According to the newspaper The Star, the new bill will allow the government to have "control over the media". The Standard, for its part, indicated that democracy and freedom of opinion in Kenya "had suffered a hard blow" and scolded the bill calling it "draconian".
The bill comes at the same time as a package of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the wake of the attack by armed Islamists in the Westgate shopping centre last September.
Kenyan media have angered authorities by broadcasting footage of surveillance cameras on which troops deployed on the scene of the attack allegedly stole the luxury shopping mall.
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded by summoning two journalists and a media official to question them, although the summons was withdrawn following a media shielding.
Under the new bill, the media could face fines of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being “deleted” or no longer able to receive official press accreditation.
The court also has the power to seize an offender's property if the offender has not paid his or her fine.
According to the Daily Nation, “even a single fine is enough to paralyze most FM stations.”
He also said the measures could have a devastating effect on what he described as Kenya’s “animated blogosphere.”
By silencing the media, politicians know they can do what they want with impunity.
“No one will ever know,” Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at The Nation, wrote, describing Kenyan media as a key source of control in public life.
“Delivered to themselves, the politicians would bankrupt the country and bring us back to hunting and gathering.”
Kenyan lawmakers have been the target of popular anger in the past.
In May, they took a stand against the cuts ordered by the National Commission for Wages and reinstated their mirobolant wages of about 532,000 shillings per month exempt from tax – which are among the highest in the world.
A difficult year for pharmacists
The departure of nearly 10 pharmacists at the Centre de santé et services sociaux (CSSS) in Laval caused quite a stir in the direction of the Hospital de la Cité-de-la-Santé, during the year 2012-2013.
Due to multiple retirements, maternity leave or short-term departures, the pharmacy department found itself severely understaffed.
Nearly 30% of the required staff was missing, making this financial year “very difficult,” according to department head Gillian Beaudet.
However, the CSSS has decided not to hire an independent workforce, which can cost up to three times more than a full-time pharmacist.
There was no use for troubleshooting, said Ms. Beaudet.
Some of our activities within the facility have been streamlined or scaled down, as time goes by.
It is certain that we have worked hard to get our young [pharmaceutical residents] interested in coming and staying here.
There is a contest of circumstances that made us in a bad situation last year.
Improving the situation
After this difficult period, the year 2013-2014 is much easier for the Department of Pharmacy of the CSSS.
Already, three pharmacists are back to work after maternity leave and three other pharmacists have been hired in recent months.
In addition, the department's efforts to retain have borne fruit, as the four students currently in residence in Laval have also decided to remain in the CSSS employment.
Now, it's much better, the pharmacist pointed out.
By the end of the fiscal year, we will have seven new pharmacists and three maternity returns.
This will fill our departures from last year.
ever-increasing needs
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as the shortage of pharmacists in the hospital or the predominance of young women in the profession, make situations such as the one experienced in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of staff] is always precarious, because we have a middle that is young and we employ a lot of young women, so with pregnancies, we almost always drive to three maternity leave when it's okay, she added.
Over the last year, we've had a lot more and we don't have pharmacists available to make replacements, so it was harder.
The 22-year-old top model doesn’t start her film career through the small door.
Director Lars von Trier chose her to play Charlotte Gainsbourg in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This pornographic drama, in eight chapters that will be released in two parts (on January 1 and 8, 2014), captures the erotic memories of a forty-year-old who has been addicted to sex since her adolescence.
Stacy Martin’s resemblance to her elder sister is striking: a brindille silhouette, a diaphanous complexion and of Franco-English origins.
Not to mention a certain taste for risk: the one who had not hesitated to lay naked on iced paper will appear in much more sulfurous situations on the big screen.
An extract of Nymphomaniac brought up the temperature on the canvas: Stacy Martin appears in bed and in full ecstasy with Shia LaBeouf.
If the provocative filmmaker asked his actors to put their modesty in the closet, he used X professionals for the most daring sex scenes, before merging all the bodies digitally: above the belt, it's the star; below, the lining.
From Bj<0xC3><0xB6>rk to Charlotte Gainsbourg, to Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has a habit of pushing his actresses in their latest installments, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.
A room of the CGR of Narbonne evacuated Thursday evening
On Thursday evening, the first session of a film was interrupted at the Mega CGR in Narbonne, as a precautionary measure, following tingling in the throat felt by the spectators.
Immediately, the director of the facility had the room evacuated and alerted the firefighters for a suspicious smell.
About 70 people came out of the session.
The people were examined and a full recognition of the room did not give anything.
Bad joke on the background of tear gas?
Or an involuntary incident?
Always it is that the management of the cinema has played the principle of precaution and the safety of its customers thoroughly.
The room was ventilated and everything went in order.
The cinema was able to take back its rights and customers regain the pleasure of the images.
On screen only.
She tries to import 2 kg of cocaine into pumpkins
Taking advantage of Halloween day, a woman tried to smuggle two kilos of cocaine hidden in pumpkins into the country on Thursday morning at Montreal-Trudeau airport.
It was during the examination of the passenger's luggage that the drug could be detected.
The cocaine had been divided into three pumpkins that had been previously emptied.
The drug was then transported to the office of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) which took over the investigation.
The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) did not reveal where the woman was coming from when she was intercepted.
This is part of the investigation, said Jacqueline Roby, a spokeswoman for the CBSA.
What I can tell you is that she was coming to the country.
Since the beginning of 2013, border officials at Montreal-Trudeau Airport have carried out 173 drug seizures, including 10 cocaine seizures for a total of 44 kilograms.
In 2012, border officials in the Quebec region carried out a total of 1,653 seizures of drugs.
Air raid on military installations in Syria
According to the Lebanese army, Israeli aircraft entered Lebanese airspace on Wednesday in the early afternoon, but the strikes took place in the evening.
A cargo of short-range SA-8 surface-to-air missiles would have been targeted and destroyed.
This new IDF airstrike on Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) has not been confirmed by either Israel or Syria.
The raid took place in roughly the same circumstances as the one that took place on July 5: at the time, it was also an anonymous US official who had confirmed to CNN an Israeli attack, this time targeting Yakhont land-sea missiles, delivered by Russia to Damascus.
Israeli officials had not hidden their irritation at seeing Washington reveal the attack, at the risk of forcing President Assad to react.
Ukraine is nearing bankruptcy.
The rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered Ukraine's credit rating on Friday, questioning the former Soviet republic's ability to cope with its financial obligations, which has been in recession for more than a year.
The rating of the country's public debt securities goes to "B-", sinking into the speculative investment category.
It is accompanied by a negative outlook, with S&P seeing at least one in three chances that it will be down again within a year.
“It is becoming less and less likely that the government’s strategy will ensure enough foreign currencies to meet its high external financing needs,” the agency said in a statement.
The agency notes that Ukraine’s foreign exchange reserves fell by 26% between September 2012 and September 2013 and predicts that the trend will continue.
This complicates the repayment of credits taken abroad.
These reserves, which the authorities use massively to support the local currency, the hryvnia, collapsing, the agency increasingly judges a devaluation, which would inflate its external debt.
Kiev also needs liquidity to settle its gas imports to Russia, which accuses it of not paying an $882 million bill.
This announcement is bad news for the Ukrainian government in a period of intense tensions with its Russian neighbor, angry at Kiev's willingness to sign an association agreement with the EU at the end of November.
It was made public the day after the publication of official statistics showing that the country's economy had suffered its fifth consecutive quarter of contraction between July and September.
Its debt, still relatively modest, has exploded in recent years and S&P estimates it at 33.5% of GDP, up from less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in a budget deficit, has been calling for months for assistance from the International Monetary Fund, which in 2010 granted it a loan of $15.3 billion and has so far unlocked only $3.4 billion.
But the Fund refuses to pay any new installments until the country has adopted unpopular reforms to reduce its deficit, including by increasing gas prices to the population.
Following an unsuccessful new mission to the country, the IMF found this week that "significant external financing needs" were "a vulnerability" and "signs of economic improvement."
However, for economist Oleksandr Joloud, of the Centre for Political Studies, "one cannot expect an improvement in the short term."
"There is little hope that unpopular reforms will be launched in a pre-election year," the expert said, according to AFP.
The only hope is an improvement in the international situation.
S&P also notes the "uncertainty" related to the possible signing of an association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions for the release of the opponent Yulia Tymoshenko.
“Signing the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there could be negative short- and medium-term consequences related to Russia’s reaction,” said S&P, which fears “trade restrictions” from Moscow.
Russia, which accounts for a quarter of Ukraine's exports, has warned that if a free trade zone is created between the EU and Kiev, it should tighten its border controls on imported goods.
U.S. green light to Publicis-Omnicom merger
Publicis and Omnicom said on Friday they had received no objections from U.S. authorities to their merger, moving closer to the creation of the world's first advertising agency.
The merger brings together the second global agency, Omnicom, and the third, Publicis.
"Omnicom Group and Publicis Groupe today announced the expiry of the previously announced review period for the merger of Publicis Group and Omnicom, as provided for by the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended," the two groups said in a statement.
They said they also received the necessary permits in Canada, India and Turkey, after South Africa and South Korea.
The expiry of the examination period provided for by the HSR in the United States and the authorisation decisions issued in the other courts satisfy several of the conditions necessary for the completion of the operation.
“The merger is also conditional on the obtaining of other regulatory authorizations and the approval of the shareholders of both groups,” they add.
Congolese army hunts down M23 rebels
The Congolese army (FARDC) announced on Thursday that its units were going to hunt down the M23 rebels as far as their bases in the forests and mountains of North Kivu bordering Rwanda and Uganda.
The M23 appears to be about to be defeated after being driven out of the northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) localities it had controlled since the start 20 months ago of the insurgency.
“We are going to prosecute M23 and hold it wherever it hides because it is a crime,” Colonel Olivier Hamuli, a spokesman for the FARDC, told Reuters.
We must not let them reorganize because they have been martyring the Congolese people for too long.
The time has come to bring peace back.
M23 officials said they evacuated the localities under diplomatic pressure and Bertrand Bissimwa, political head of the rebellion, said on RFI that these military setbacks would not alter his demands for peace talks.
According to Ugandan mediators, the latter resumed on Wednesday in Kampala between the Kinshasa government and the M23.
Hangings are reported in the hills that dominate Bunagana, the last locality in the hands of the insurgents to fall this week, as well as around Runyoni, a hill where the M23 rebellion originated in 2012.
At their peak in November, the insurgents occupied Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, taking advantage of the government garrison leak and the passivity of the Monusco blue helmets.
The fall of Goma led the United Nations Mission in the DRC, the world's largest in terms of manpower, to strengthen its mandate and form a rapid response brigade composed of South African, Malawian and Tanzanian soldiers.
For its part, the FARDC staff was redesigned and the army went on the offensive against the M23, changing the course of the war.
The pace of progress of government troops is unprecedented today.
“The M23 seems to be coming to an end,” says Congolese affairs expert Jason Stearns on his Congo Siasa blog.
This would be historic – it would be the first time the Kinshasa government has succeeded in defeating a major insurgency.
And it would also be the first time since 1996 that no allied armed groups in Rwanda would be present in eastern DRC.
UN experts accuse Rwanda, which fiercely denies it, of militarily supporting the M23, which was formed from the departure of former mutinied Congolese military.
The head of British diplomacy, William Hague, has invited Rwandan President Paul Kagame to show restraint, a spokesman for the Foreign Office said.
Last week, Kigali had raised the possibility of military reprisals following the shelling of Rwandan territory.
On Wednesday, residents of Bunagana invaded the streets of the village to greet the entrance of the FARDC soldiers.
“We lived with M23 for a year and it seemed unimaginable to us that we would one day be liberated by the army,” said a resident of the neighbouring Uganda.
"We lived in terror (of M23), we are traumatized," the man added.
Tests conducted by the Institut Pasteur on a patient suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have turned out to be negative, the health ministry said.
The two cases identified in May 2013 remain the only two confirmed cases in France to date.
On Tuesday, the 43-year-old patient was suspected of being infected after returning from Saudi Arabia, a country where the disease has already killed about 50 people.
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, reported a decline in its quarterly profit on Friday due to lower refining margins, while its oil and gas production increased while remaining behind the group’s targets.
Its third-quarter net profit fell to $4.95 billion, or $2.57 per share, from $5.25 billion, or $2.69 per share, a year earlier.
Analysts polled by Reuters had an average earnings per share of $2.71.
The group produced 2.59 million barrels of oil equivalent per day during the quarter, up from 2.52 million bpj produced a year earlier.
The company is targeting 2.65 million bpj for this year, with 25% expected production growth by 2017.
Most of the growth in the coming years will come from its liquefied natural gas projects in Australia.
Due to the cost of these projects, annual investment expenditures have increased by $7 billion in two years and are expected to reach $36.7 billion in 2013.
Profits from production activities decreased slightly in the third quarter, while profits from downstream activities (including refining and chemical production) fell from 45% to $380 million.
This decline in refining margins affects the entire sector.
Chevron’s main competitor, Exxon Mobil, reported a declining net profit on Thursday, despite the increase in its gas and oil production.
Transport of schoolchildren: the complaint deemed admissible
The School Board of the Sherbrooke Region (CSRS) has been requiring a fee of $150 per student (up to a maximum of $300 per family) from the beginning of the school year for students benefiting from school transportation to two residences, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Prior to the changes to the last budget, no financial contribution was claimed.
"There is a mediation service that is proposed by the commission and I was interested," explains Lef<0xC3><0xA8>vre.
According to her, the CSRS was invited to a mediation and asked for an additional period of time to reflect on it.
"It is always better to talk about it, to work together and to find solutions," says Lef<0xC3><0xA8>vre.
The Sherbrooke Region School Board (CSRS) declined to comment.
The organization has only meant that mediation is part of the process during a complaint.
Imbroglio around the closure of the emergencies of the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu
Faced with the blunder carried out by some of the staff and several unions, including the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on July 10 to "deploy the schedule of implementation of the project, and in particular the date of closure of the emergencies that will not be able to intervene on November 4".
A request officially made "to run no risk on the management of emergencies in Paris at the beginning of winter" but also aimed at not hindering the PS campaign a few months from the municipalities.
Despite the ministerial guidelines, the closure should still be effective on that date.
Although, at the APHP, we prefer to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
As of November 4, firefighters who provided about a quarter of the 40,000 annual hospitalizations at the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu will have all been instructed to take about 30 serious cases a day to other Parisian hospitals.
This date of November 4 also corresponds to the renewal of boarding schools.
At the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu, emergency interns will be able to accommodate five general medicine interns on Monday.
As for the transfer of internal medicine beds, it is scheduled for the course of the month.
"The emergency reception service of the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu must close as soon as possible, and for us it is November 4th," says Lo<0xC3><0xAF>c Capron, the president of the medical commission of establishment (CME) of the APHP, which supports the management project.
"On November 4, there will be no more patients brought by firefighters, only people coming by their own means," confirms Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical manager of the new H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu.
“But we will continue to welcome emergency patients,” he said, arguing for the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles on site to transfer serious cases.
Senior emergency doctors will remain in place, he said.
But it is up to the SRA to decide on the closure of the emergency reception service.
"Things are happening gradually," says Nicolas Péju, spokesman for the ARS, for whom, on November 4, "there will be no change in terms of service rendered."
"The minister lied to us or he was lied to," says emergency physician Gérald Kierzek.
After resigning from his position as head of the SMUR in early July for leading the front against the reorganization project, he defines himself as a "alert launcher" in the face of a "cynical" decision made by "the medico-administrative technostructure".
“They are emptying and asphyxiating emergency rooms that were renovated less than five years ago,” he said.
For him, "if other Parisian emergency services could absorb the surplus, there would be no problem."
But they are regularly ingested.
For example, there are sometimes nine hours of waiting in Lariboisi<0xC3><0xA8>re's emergencies.
In the SAR, it is argued that thirty patients "dispatched" on several sites are not likely to represent an "avalanche" in the other emergency services, whose human resources have also been strengthened.
Both the ARS and the APHP defend the "new hospital model" already underway since October 7 and which is expected to continue to accommodate 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
By the end of the year, liberal general practitioners are also expected to participate in the establishment of a "permanence of outpatient care".
"Where do we go if people are asked to self-diagnose?" asks Gérald Kierzek, for whom "the concept of no serious emergency" is "dangerous" and marks a "medical regression".
This is going to happen as for level 3 maternity care.
People are not crazy, they go where there is the best offer of care.
If the minister does not take action by Monday, we will change the bracket, warns Christophe Prudhomme, an emergency physician and member of the CGT Santé.
We will be even more present as part of the municipal campaign and we will consider presenting a list.
In the team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Morizet, Vincent Roger, adviser to UMP of Paris and elected from the 4th arrondissement, clearly announces that "even if the Parisian UMP was for the maintenance of emergencies at the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu, it would be technically and financially impossible to reopen them if we return to the responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, reminded again on Monday morning on France Inter that she had voted in favor of a moratorium so that there would be no closure on November 4.
If that were the case, it would mark his sharp disagreement, said Bruno Julliard, his spokesman.
Even if the restructuring of the H<0xC3><0xB4>tel-Dieu has its legitimacy on the merits, we cannot admit it without an acceptable scheme of transfer to other hospitals.
Obama ends talks with IMF and World Bank
Barack Obama has ordered the National Security Agency (NSA) to stop listening to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank as part of its intelligence activities, a U.S. official said Thursday.
This decision is part of the White House’s attempt to get its hands on the NSA wiretapping case after revelations by former analyst Edward Snowden, a refugee in Russia.
This is the first time that the IMF and the World Bank have been mentioned by the intelligence agency since the scandal began.
Asked about the matter, a US administration official replied: “The US does not conduct electronic surveillance targeting World Bank and IMF headquarters in Washington.”
Speaking under the seal of anonymity, the official did not specify whether such surveillance had been put in place in the past.
Another official, he said, said Barack Obama had ordered these practices to stop in the past few weeks.
This instruction was given at about the same time as the one ending the listening of the United Nations headquarters in New York.
In this context, the Senate Intelligence Commission approved Thursday a strengthening of controls on government surveillance programs but authorized their continuation.
The commission imposed new restrictions on the data intelligence agencies are allowed to collect and imposed a five-year limit on the retention of that information.
The United Nations welcomes the new objectives in the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new set of targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which were established 12 years ago to combat global poverty.
Australian diplomats played a key role in putting forward “sustainable development goals” to replace the MDGs, which will expire in 2015, ahead of the UN Sustainable Development Summit that began the day before in Rio de Janeiro.
They were included in the final draft of the document, which will be adopted by world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said on the eve of the summit that it was now time to “exceed national interests”.
“I am pleased that Member States have agreed to launch and take ownership of the process to set universal sustainable development goals (SDGs),” he added.
These SDGs will build on progress under the Millennium Development Goals and be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will do my utmost to fulfil the mandate given to me by Member States to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals based on the success of the MDGs.
Mozambique’s security concerns are growing as conflicts erupt between powerful figures.
At the foot of the statue of Samora Machel, Mozambique’s founding president, as they toiled, thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo to chant peaceful slogans during a rare public demonstration.
“We want peace to come back; we want stability,” said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment company.
Concerned about the future of her country, she exchanged her work clothes for a T-shirt with the words “we want security” in Portuguese before joining the crowd gathered in the capital’s Independence Square on Thursday.
For two weeks, there have been virtually daily reports of conflict between government forces and Renamo, the worst hangovers since the peace agreement that was signed more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a famous rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and then the apartheid government of South Africa as part of efforts to destabilize the country's independent government.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe the country should not fall back into open conflict, but recent events have rocked foreign investors and the local population.
The stakes are considerable for the growing economy as the discovery of huge offshore gas reserves and coal deposits in the northwest could attract more than $50 billion in investments over the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale of Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko of the United States.
The Frelimo, the ruling party and the main political force since 1975, and the Renamo mutually reject responsibility for the tensions.
Renamo says the government is behind the recent clashes and launched an attack on its members in Sofala province, a traditional Renamo stronghold, on October 17.
The attacks on the former rebels then degenerated when government forces attacked Renamo’s bases and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group’s leader, and Fernando Mazanga, Renamo’s spokesman, according to the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for triggering the conflicts, and accuses her of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has sought to minimize concerns about instability.
Guebuza told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a “loser” who wanted to use “all the strength he had left to try to prove that he could impose his decisions on the government.”
The Frelimo and the Renamo insist that they both wish to avoid war.
But concern grew after Mr. Mazanga said Renamo was abandoning the 1992 peace agreement.
He told the FT that he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
“We want to resume negotiations, but with the greatest seriousness,” Mazanga said.
Previous discussions between the parties have failed to ease tensions fueled by a series of conflicts this year.
“These are two great men (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who keep fighting,” said Joseph Hanlon, an open university lecturer and specialist in Mozambique.
None of them knows how to negotiate and none of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said it would boycott the municipal elections to be held in November.
Presidential and legislative elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted its use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and a war treasure from the government.
The share of votes collected by Renamo has been falling steadily since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM), which was created by a former member of Renamo, is expected to win more votes in the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said Mr. Guebuza – who is expected to step down at the end of his second term next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn’t want a multi-party democracy, he doesn’t want transparent elections, he doesn’t want peace because he doesn’t want to leave the presidency,” Mazanga said.
It is not known exactly what Renamo’s capacity is, but it has carried out disruptive lightning attacks on police stations and vehicles on a major north-south highway axis.
Most of the hangings took place in Sofala province, which is located several hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but where Beira, the port from which mining companies, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export coal.
In June, Rio was no longer able to use the railway for about a week after Renamo threatened to attack the railway line.
Mr. Mazanga was falsely shy when asked if Renamo would repeat that threat.
Renamo wanted to “warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique,” Mazanga said.
Instability has heightened frustrations with the government, says Fernando Lima, director of Mediacoop, an independent media company, with many people also concerned about corruption, slow development and the recent wave of kidnappings.
“People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country’s future, and it’s up to the president to find solutions to the problems,” he said.
Omar Sultane, a protester, said people only wanted stability.
“No one cares about the Renamo or the Frelimo, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to the roads,” he added.
Myths and legends should be taught to children as “lifestyle models,” says the author.
Thor’s Legend might show that “brutal force does not weight against subtle cunning,” while Arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Saying that many myths would be “far too violent, far too scandalous, and in some cases far too obscene to be taught in school,” Crossley-Holland advocated a “careful selection” of age-appropriate works.
“I think it’s great that in America, myths and folklore are already part of education,” he said.
I have been advocating for this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are “openly didactic” makes the children “completely drop out”, the messages being “sublimated” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: “You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of sight.”
Perhaps the big difference between an adult author writing for adults and an adult author writing for children is the need to offer hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or end well, but there is an innate sense of good and evil.
And it must be sublimated; revealed through a story rather than declared.
The known basis of what is shown and not said.
One Hamas fighter was killed tonight and another wounded by an Israeli tank fire in the Gaza Strip, medical and security sources in Gaza have learned.
According to these sources, these activists were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they suffered a shelling of an Israeli armored vehicle.
NSA spying: U.S. has gone too far, Kerry admits
The United States has sometimes gone “too far” in spying, Secretary of State John Kerry acknowledged in Washington’s first confession in the midst of a dispute with Europe over the massive collection of data by the National Security Agency (NSA).
After ten days of scandal, revelations and denials between the United States and its European allies, this is the first time a U.S. government official has explicitly admitted controversial practices in NSA interception of communications and data in Europe.
“In some cases, I’m giving it to you, as the president did, some of these actions have gone too far and we’re going to make sure it doesn’t happen in the future,” Kerry said at a conference in London that he attended from Washington on Thursday, Oct. 31 via video link.
In his retransmitted speech, in the presence of his British counterpart William Hague, the head of American diplomacy has long justified the practices of intelligence and information collection by the necessary counter-terrorism and prevention against possible attacks.
Citing the September 11 attacks, the Madrid attacks in March 2004 and those in London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the US authorities had since foiled many plans for attacks, through the interception of communications and the collection of information.
“We actually prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being killed, because we were able to be aware of these projects ahead of time,” he said.
And, John Kerry said to the Europeans, "I assure you that in this process innocent people have not been deceived."
But we are trying to gather information.
"And yes, in some cases, it went too far inappropriately," said the secretary of state, who had already had to speak out about the international scandal during a tour last week in Paris, London and Rome.
He said Thursday night that President Obama was "determined to try to clarify and reassess these practices so that no one feels wrong."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to escalate this week with new revelations in the press.
According to the Washington Post, the NSA intercepted data from hundreds of millions of Google and Yahoo users.
The paper, which cites documents obtained from former NSA consultant Edward Snowden, claims that the program dubbed "MUSCULAR," and led with the British NSA counterpart, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to retrieve data from the fiber optics used by internet giants.
According to one of the documents, some 181 million items had been collected in the last month alone – ranging from metadata on emails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interceptions would take place outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google have denied any link to these practices.
For the past ten days, several major newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA has massively intercepted data and communications from US allies and their leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Faced with the anger of European states and while leaks in the US press claimed that the US president was not aware of such listening, Barack Obama refused to speak out, citing national security.
The head of the powerful NSA, General Keith Alexander, denied that his intelligence agency had intercepted tens of millions of communications from European citizens.
He even sent the bullet back to the European intelligence services who allegedly seized these communications, before providing them to the NSA.
This would involve “military operations” in countries where these NATO allies cooperate with the United States and it would not be aimed at Europe at all, General Alexander said.
And the controversy spread to Asia on Friday.
Indonesia has summoned the ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans as part of a vast international espionage network that has also sparked the ire of China.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his master asset, Swedish Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who is injured, the Ligue 1 club announced in a statement.
PSG, the leader of the championship against Monaco in contrast to goals, has released the list of players selected for this match of the 12th day, without the 32-year-old striker.
The statement simply states that he is "injured", without specifying the nature of the injury.
However, he suffered from inflammation of the left knee when he returned from selection at the beginning of the month.
A ceremony in memory of the cremated deceased
The crematorium of P<0xC3><0xA8>re Lachaise organizes, at 11 a.m., a secular ceremony, in memory of all the deceased cremated in its establishment, during the year.
Anne Hidalgo, a socialist candidate for the Paris mayoralty, will attend, and will then explain at a press conference her proposals on funerals.
To follow the ceremony, click above.
For their own funerals, more and more French people choose cremation, rather than burial: 53%, according to an Ipsos study conducted on 6 and 7 September among 1009 people, instead of 47%.
For the funeral of a loved one, the opposite is true: the French prefer burial (53% versus 47%).
If they have the misfortune of losing a child, they are only 15% to choose cremation.
In his book Death in the Ashes, Damien Le Guay, philosopher and vice-president of the National Funeral Ethics Committee, emphasizes the "violence" that cremation constitutes, for survivors.
There is, with cremation, "violence done to the beloved body", which will be "reduced to a pile of ashes" in a very short time, and not after a process of decomposition, which "would accompany the phases of mourning".
There is also "symbolic violence", which is due to the "erasing of the singularity and distinctive signs" reduced to the "anonymity" of the ashes.
Why is what is accepted without difficulty in some Nordic and Protestant countries still poorly lived in France?
"Because cremation is a new fact," says Marie-Frédérique Bacqué, president of the Society of Thanatology and author of the book Apprivoiser la mort.
It has only been tolerated since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited attempts to impoverish it.
For Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Michaud-Nérard, Director General of the Funeral Services of the City of Paris, to approve cremation is to provide for the deceased a ceremony as worthy as that to which he would be entitled with an burial.
The annual Ipsos survey shows a very strong commitment to the organization of the ceremony.
77% of French people want one, for their relatives, whether it is religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Now, 73% of people who have chosen a cremation wish to organize a ceremony.
66% of atheists and non-believers want it too.
Crematoriums have adapted to this evolution of society.
"For a decade, they have been trying to avoid the violence of waiting for families, without doing anything, for an hour and a half, immediately followed by the ashes being handed over," says Michaud-Nérard.
70% of the institutions now offer masters of ceremonies, which proceed, in the presence of the body, to the following ritual: to welcome the assembly, to name the deceased, to connect him to others, to evoke him, to give meaning to his death, to organize farewell.
This is the case at the crematorium of P<0xC3><0xA8>re Lachaise, since 1998.
The masters of the ceremony are often people who have reconverted.
There are also former Catholic priests.
It is in this context that the crematorium of P<0xC3><0xA8>re Lachaise organizes, since 2010, on the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of remembrance, secular and non-religious, to which it invites the families of people who have been cremated in the year.
For the second year in a row, one of these ceremonies is broadcast inline, to the attention of those who could not make the trip.
The crematorium allowed us to relay it.
In La Seyne, the relocation because of rats turns to controversy
At the beginning of the week, a family left their apartment on the ground floor of the Fructidor D2 building, due to the presence of rats.
In the face of the urgency of the situation, the director of the South Lands Habitat office proposed, exceptionally and provisionally, to relocate the couple and their three children in a new T4.
However, the family refuses "for financial reasons" and the situation is blocked.
The case has taken on exaggerated proportions, according to Joel Canapa, the director of the office.
Rats have always been found in cities.
The deratization company carries out two passes per year, and in addition, we intervene, at our expense, at each request of the inhabitants.
Since the end of last winter, we have carried out 64 interventions.
The neighborhood is not abandoned, and rats do not swarm in the city.
For reasons of environmental protection and public health, deratization products are four times less effective than in the past, of course, but for two rats, we are not going to kill a child.
“We didn’t invite the rats to our house,” defends the family father who left his home to settle in the hotel.
We are soon without the money and we are waiting for a new accommodation, at the same rate as the old one.
Tokyo Stock Exchange Drops 0.88%, News
The Tokyo Stock Exchange ended down on Friday despite good Chinese manufacturing statistics.
The rating suffered from the dollar's decline against the yen, which is detrimental to export values and the warning about its annual result launched by Sony on Thursday.
The Nikkei lost 126.37 points (0.88%) to 14,201.57 and the Topix dropped 11.23 points (0.94%) to 1,183.03.
Sony fell more than 11% to 1,668 yen.
A house the prey of flames in Old Quebec
A fire that broke out at noon on Friday in Old Quebec was quickly contained.
More than thirty firefighters were dispatched to 9 rue Hébert.
The flames broke out in a three-family house spread over four floors located behind the court of the Séminaire de Québec.
All tenants were absent at the time of the fire.
The fire was controlled an hour after the arrival of the firefighters, who were numerous to intervene.
As soon as our first firefighters arrived, they really saw the apparent smoke.
"Then the alarms followed, because it took reinforcement to attack the building, because it is buildings stuck here," said France Loiselle, spokesman for the Quebec fire department.
An investigation is underway to find the cause of the fire.
Ben Greenman: 10th Anniversary of the New York Comedy Festival: The New Yorker
One could say that the city of New York is where stand-up was born in America: almost 100 years ago, vaudeville actor Frank Fay, who held the role of master of ceremonies at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began to tell jokes directly in front of the audience, on the tone of the conversation.
Fay's innovation continued through the years, until it was picked up more recently by the New York Comedy Festival.
Created and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the Carolines stand-up club, the festival celebrates its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theaters.
“Most of the headliners have emerged at the Carolines, and have had great success, until they became too famous to play in a club,” Hirsch said.
We created this festival in order to be able to continue working with them.
This year's event will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of "Stand Up for Heroes", a comedy and music evening for veterans, organized at Madison Square Garden, which will be attended by, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has grown in size, as has the world of comedy.
Several of the actors participating in this year’s festival have gone on non-traditional tours, presenting shows on small TV channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike, for example.
Nick Kroll made his appearance on the front of the stage in a sitcom on a cable channel (“The League” on the theme of fantasy football joyfully lascivious of the FXX channel) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate appeared on Saturday Night Live and was part of the cast of Parks and Recreation, but is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young actors with a singular voice (surrealist pessimist Anthony Jeselnik, ironic racial justice advocate W. Kamau Bell), are pure products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the main attractions of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg chatting with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but he became an accomplished film and television director, as well as an unofficial historian of comedy.
Between 2005 and 2007, he hosted a TV Land show called "Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg".
The meeting takes place at the City Hall, in central Manhattan.
“The city is definitely in the comic DNA of all Larry’s work,” Steinberg said.
He used to tell me that when he was here, sometimes he would go down an alley between two buildings and say, "Well, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll come live here."
Oil prices continue to fall, approaching $96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday as concerns about the importance of stocks offset a report showing that China's power-hungry manufacturing sector is strengthening.
The price of U.S. reference crude for delivery in December fell by 14 cents to $96.24 a barrel late in the morning in Europe during electronic exchanges on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).
The contract lost 39 cents on Thursday, leaving it with a 5.8 percent drop for the month of October.
The abundant supply of crude oil has weighed on the price in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supplies had increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
Over five weeks, supplies have increased by more than 25 million barrels.
But two reports on the Chinese manufacturing sector arrived on Friday, which show growth in activity, suggest an increase in demand.
This suggests that China's economic recovery could continue to solidify after growth rebounded to 7.8% in the third quarter, after a decline not seen in the past two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude already used by U.S. refineries, lost 26 cents to fall to $108.58 a barrel on the Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE) in London.
The right to abortion in Texas has been challenged
A federal appeals court in Texas has reinstated certain restrictions on the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy that had been blocked by a trial judge this week.
This ruling means that a law passed in July in that state that largely calls into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
The Court of Appeal ruling means that doctors who practice GIVs will have to have an "admission privilege" at local hospitals.
The privilege of admission is the right of a physician, by virtue of his or her status as a hospital care member, to admit a patient to a hospital or medical centre in order to provide a diagnosis or treatment.
IVG advocates argue that the content of the law may result in an immediate closure of one-third of state clinics because these clinics have failed to obtain this "admission privilege" for their practitioners.
In total, nearly 22,000 women would be denied access to these facilities.
On Monday, a first-instance judge ruled on the eve of the law's entry into force that the provisions dealing with the privilege of admission were unconstitutional.
But the Texas Attorney General, Republican Greg Abbott, who is running for governor, has asked the appeals court to overturn the first-instance ruling that blocked law enforcement.
A plenary hearing on this issue is scheduled for January.
The New Star made a comeback, on the audience side, with 1.3 million viewers behind their TV station, or 5.6% of the audience.
But was the show on the rendezvous?
Some 10,000 candidates showed up for auditions this 10th season, to face the jury: Maurane, the evil Sinclair, the perched André Manoukian and Olivier Bas.
On Twitter, viewers shared their comments.
After the excitement of finding their favorite program, many were disappointed.
But why so much disappointment?
No candidate seems to have really scored on this first prize.
As every year, the first audition shows brew a wide selection of singers in the grass, for the best and sometimes for the worst.
Now, on Twitter, we want the show, the emotion, the originality, the music...
Fortunately, a few found their account there.
There are many who have tried the New Star, and sometimes even have gone all the way.
Behind the television screens, the vocations of a successful singer are always there, season after season.
Others just have the ambition to make you laugh.
The court blocks a decision on the NYPD’s control and search policy
A federal appeals court on Thursday blocked a judge's decision demanding changes to the New York Police Department's control and search program and dismissed the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals (Second Circuit) said Judge Shira Scheindlin's decision was suspended until the city's appeal was over.
The judge ruled in August that the city had violated the Constitution following the implementation of its program to control and interrogate citizens.
The city appealed its findings and corrective orders, including a decision to assign a controller to assist the police department in changing its policy and associated training program.
The Court of Appeal heard arguments on the application for suspension on Tuesday.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge must be dismissed because she violated the judges' code of conduct by compromising the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of bias, in part because of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly reacted to the court's criticisms.
The judge ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by wrongly targeting black and Hispanic men as part of their control and search program.
It appointed an external controller to oversee the changes, including policy reform, training and supervision, and ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test body-mounted cameras in the areas where the largest number of controls are carried out.
In August, New York City agreed to end the practice of keeping the names and addresses of people whose cases are dismissed after police checks.
The city's appeal hearing is expected to take place after March 14, 2014.
The tactics of control and search have been criticized by many civil rights defenders.
This control and search system has existed for decades in some form, but the number of checks recorded has increased dramatically under the administration of independent Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to reach its highest historical level in 2011 with 684,330 checks that concerned mainly black and Hispanic men.
A lawsuit was introduced in 2004 by four men, all from minorities, and turned into a class action lawsuit.
Proponents of changes to the NYPD’s control and search program say they will end unfair practices, enable more effective and trusted police forces, and change the way police departments use policy.
Opponents say these changes would undermine police morale without reducing crime, represent a waste of money and would not solve the broader problem of police forces under pressure after police numbers have been greatly reduced over the past decade.
The judge pointed out that she was not ending the control and search practices, which are constitutional, but was reforming the way the NYPD implemented its controls.
Renters have to go vote, as each of them pays an average of $100 per month on the price of housing that goes into taxes to the City.
When the landlord pays $5,000 in municipal taxes, he divides that amount between each dwelling.
We are forced to increase rents to help us pay the new taxes.
When we go to vote, we send a clear message.
We need to change things in the city.
All the candidates told us they would tackle the scandalous debt.
We no longer have the means to pay $100,000 for fireworks, $4 million to $5 million for land in case...
Go vote, it's the best way to express yourself and say it's enough.
End of service for the chef of the Elysée
Entering the 500 m2 of the Elysian kitchens as committed after working in embassies, the cook climbed all the stairs until becoming a chef nine years ago.
He served six French presidents, from Georges Pompidou to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande through Nicolas Sarkozy, including on their vacation spots, and fed an incalculable number of the greats of this world in a quasi-anonymity that he only breaks today, at the time of retirement, at 60.
The man with an open face, stripped skull and glasses of intellectual, born on October 24, 1953 at the Ferté-Saint-Aubin is the holder of a CAP of pastry.
Her mother was herself a cook in a castle in Sologne.
“I’ve gone from one castle to another,” said Bernard Vaussion, who knows not only the mania of the six presidents he officiated for, but also their wives and some of their illustrious guests.
“It is always the head of state or his partner or wife who chooses the menus,” he recalls.
"Ms. Chirac was a little more involved, she was coming straight to the kitchen," to the point that she had banned women in the kitchens of the Elysée!
It does not displease heads of state who showed a relative indifference to terrestrial foods, “they are all greedy,” kindly denounces Bernard Vaussion.
Jacques Chirac certainly had "a slightly more developed appetite".
But with Nicolas Sarkozy, who had removed the cheese, the plates came back empty!
As for Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande, who restored the cheese, "it's someone who likes to eat" and "there's not much he doesn't like".
The current head of state, who regained the pounds lost before the presidential campaign, has "no specific regime demand".
Bernard Vaussion also remembers the pressure that weighed on his shoulders, especially during state dinners at the Elysée: it is necessary to serve "between 200 and 250 people in about an hour".
The night before is almost white.
These people would not understand that there are mistakes.
The now-former chef of the cuisines of the Elysée, who had a drink on Tuesday evening with his team, family and friends, leaves with a pinch to the heart.
He said praise.
“The human side has come out,” he said.
The leader will be replaced by his deputy, Guillaume Gomez, 35, who has been in the Elysée for seventeen years.
Fire in a house built in 1850 in Quebec City
A historic house built in 1850 was the flamethrower in Old Quebec on Friday afternoon.
The four-storey building, located at 15 rue Hébert, was the subject of three fire alarms.
The fire broke out at the front, but rose over the three floors of the building.
France Voiselle, spokesman for the Quebec Fire Protection Service, said the rapid response from firefighters prevented the spread of flames to adjacent buildings, a major challenge for this area of the city where buildings are built in close proximity.
The burned house housed four dwellings, but no tenants were on the premises at the time of the fire.
The damage was quite limited, even though the water caused damage.
An investigation will be conducted to determine its origin, but the sappers have dismissed the thesis of a criminal act.
The Wolf of Wall Street: The Second Trailer
Martin Scorsese lets escape some images of his next film whose title role, that of an ambitious New York broker, is played by Leonardo DiCaprio.
Forget about being reasonable and get your tickets out.
Leonardo DiCaprio will decipher you in his role as a crazy trader.
Martin Scorsese tells the true story of a Long Island stockbroker who refuses to cooperate with the authorities in a massive corruption case on Wall Street.
In the 1980s, Jordan Belfort set up a scam that would make him a rich, very rich man.
The opportunity to follow its incredible ascent, but also the dizzying fall that will follow.
Without limits, man chained parties, women, drugs.
Decadence and excess of all kinds are the master words of this crazy story.
The Scorsese-DiCaprio couple seem to have found the magic that had united them in Shutter Island.
The release of the new Scorsese was delayed due to its too long assembly.
It looks like the movie will last 2:45.
On the 25th of December, he will be able to participate in the Oscars.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a pipe
Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson reportedly used “phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation” to try to confirm a slug on a link involving then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey court that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, his “pretty special counsel.”
It was reported in court that the newspaper had commissioned Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator, to hack Pawlby's voicemail and "plant permanently at his door", but Coulson also called her and left her voice messages.
“The accusation suggests that Mr. Coulson, who is now the editor-in-chief of NotW, is not the kind of man to stand in front of people’s houses hoping to surprise them, he’s the kind of man who likes to present history to people to see what they’re saying,” Edis said.
He said NotW used three means to investigate the topics: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The editor-in-chief is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that he is aware of the second, surveillance, it can not be otherwise.
But what about the first one?
Is he aware of phone hacking?
He says otherwise, but we say “Of course it is.”
Rumors about a connection involving Clarke were first picked up by the NotW editorial office when a source, feeling a sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, told her: “Don’t waste your time with her, she’s with Charles.”
A tape, on which pirated voice messages were recorded on his phone at least three times, was seized at Mulcaire's home in August 2006.
Investigators also found computer entries on the private investigator's computer that concerned Ms. Pawlby and her sister stored in a "Projects" folder.
During the time the detective investigated her, Ms. Pawlby’s grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about her, Mr. Edis added.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup oversaw the monitoring of Ms. Pawlby's every move.
In a voice message he left him on June 18, 2005, Coulson said, “I have a story that we plan to publish tomorrow that I’d really like to talk to Charles about.”
Mr. Edis explained that Coulson's involvement in the story followed the same pattern as with other important men, such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett about an affair with a married woman while he himself was dating co-defendant Rebekah Brooks, who was also married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack into phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to having carried out phone hacking.
Barack Obama Receives Prime Minister of Iraq, in the throes of violence
The U.S. president was due to receive Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki on Friday, November 1, 2013, in search of U.S. help in fighting the strongest wave of violence in five years.
Iraq experienced its deadliest month in five-and-a-half years in October, according to figures released Friday by Iraqi authorities.
964 people died in the violence in October, including 855 civilians, 65 police and 44 soldiers, and 1,600 people were injured.
The UN estimates that 979 people have died and 1,902 have been injured.
These violence are increasingly deadly despite increased security measures and large-scale military operations launched by the Shiite-dominated Nouri Al Maliki government in recent months.
The total number of deaths in October is the highest since April 2008, when 1,073 people had been killed.
About two years after the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the level of violence is fearing a new outbreak as neighboring Syria is in the throes of civil war.
The bombs hit markets, mosques, weddings and funerals.
Men are shot in the street or even at home, and security forces are also the target of frequent attacks.
The growing discontent of the Sunni minority in power under Saddam Hussein, who complains of being politically marginalized and being the target of unjust arrests, has fueled this outbreak of violence.
On Friday, new violence killed four people in northern Iraq, following the death of at least 26 people in a series of attacks, including the explosion of five cars trapped north of Baghdad.
Much of the violence has been blamed on the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), an al-Qaeda-affiliated group (Sunni extremists), also involved in the civil war in Syria.
Nouri Al Maliki wants a "world war" against Al-Qaeda.
The violence is at the heart of Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki’s U.S. talks that will be hosted by President Barack Obama on Friday, two years after their previous meeting on December 12, 2011.
At the time, the American president-elect, on a promise to end military engagement in that country, had drawn up an optimistic picture of the situation.
Since his arrival Wednesday in Washington, Nouri Al Maliki has multiplied meetings with the executive, and the elected members of Congress.
On Thursday, he called for the international community to wage a “third world war” against al-Qaida.
The principle of increased security assistance to Iraq is supported by influential Republican and Democratic senators.
But the latter also criticized Nouri Al Maliki, a Shiite, as giving him partial responsibility for the resumption of violence by his "sectarian and authoritarian policies".
They also demanded from Barack Obama to make Nouri Al Maliki understand that “Iran’s pernicious influence within the Iraqi government is a serious problem in our bilateral relationship.”
Beijing accuses Uighur group of Tiananmen attack
China's domestic security chief accused a group of Xinjiang Uighur separatists of being behind the car bomb attack that killed five people at Tiananmen Square in central Beijing on Monday.
The vehicle, an SUV, sank into the crowd that was in the famous square of the Chinese capital, a symbol of the deadly repression carried out in 1989, and caught fire killing its three passengers and two passers-by.
Meng Jianzhu, a member of the Political Bureau in charge of domestic security issues, accused the Islamic movement of eastern Turkestan of being the instigator of this attack.
Many Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking minority based in Xinjiang, call this Chinese province East Turkestan.
For the Chinese government, this movement is responsible for the frequent eruptions of violence that occur there, driven by independence claims.
“The violent terrorist incident that occurred in Beijing was organized and premeditated,” Meng told Hong Kong-based Phoenix TV.
"The group behind the scenes was the Islamic movement of eastern Turkestan," he added, his remarks being echoed by the new China agency.
Chinese police identified the driver of the vehicle whose name suggests he is of Uighur origin and said his wife and mother were with him in the car.
The latter also contained containers filled with gasoline and a flag with Orthodox religious inscriptions.
The incident injured 42 people.
The Islamic Movement of Eastern Turkestan is considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the United Nations.
Vatican probes on contraception, divorce and homosexuality
The Vatican has undertaken a major worldwide survey on how parishes manage sensitive cases such as contraception, divorce and same-sex couples.
The survey asks participants how priests care for gay couples and their children, and how they treat men and women who live together without being united by the bonds of marriage.
The poll was sent in mid-October to each national bishops' conference, with instructions to get as many answers as possible.
The information will be used for an important gathering on the family that Pope Francis plans to organize next year.
The news was reported Thursday by the National Catholic Reporter, an independent Catholic newspaper in the United States.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops confirmed that the document was authentic and that each bishop would decide how to properly survey parishioners.
In the UK, bishops published the survey on the Internet asking Catholics to participate.
DRC: the army attacks the last stronghold of the rebels
The M23's irreducibles, a few hundred fighters, were cut off at almost 2,000 metres above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two localities about 80 km north of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province.
“It hasn’t stopped since this morning, the fighting continues despite the night,” a resident of Jomba, who was contacted by telephone at around 12:30 p.m., told AFP.
"The intensity of the clashes has decreased a bit," he added, "it seems that the FARDC Armed Forces of the DRC have pushed back the rebels a bit."
According to the witness, who wished to remain anonymous, the soldiers had "spent the night" in Jomba before going up to the front for a "ratification operation".
Behind him were heard very clearly cracks fed with small arms.
From Bunagana, the political stronghold and last stronghold of the rebellion that fell on Wednesday, an AFP journalist could hear heavy weapons detonations.
According to a source at the United Nations Stabilization Mission in the DRC, the fighting has entered "a final phase", with the FARDC having "circulated the residual M23 positions to dislodge them".
Since the resumption of clashes between the March 23 Movement (M23) and the army on Friday, Monusco has not been directly involved in the fighting, but it has provided government troops with crucial intelligence, observation and planning support.
At the end of the afternoon, several dozen soldiers, well supplied with ammunition, were climbing towards the front line.
They were armed with Kalashnikovs and rocket launchers.
A little earlier, on the road leading to Bunagana, a border post with Uganda, aided soldiers of civilians loaded a multiple rocket launcher mounted on a brand new FARDC truck, to ensure the succession of another machine piloting the positions of the M23 on the hills.
Congolese President Joseph Kabila called on Wednesday night once again for the rebels to "voluntarily demobilize" on the condition of being disarmed "by force", but left the Kampala process open, where Kinshasa and the M23 have been discussing since December without results for the moment.
On the ground, the political leaders of the M23 hope to reach an agreement.
"We have finished the talks, it is only up to the Ugandan mediation to organize the signing," said Roger Lumbala, vice-chairman of the M23 delegation, without this information being immediately confirmed by the government.
The M23 was born from a mutiny, in April 2012, of former rebels, mainly Tutsi, integrated into the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
The UN and Kinshasa regularly accuse Uganda and Rwanda of supporting M23, which Kigali and Kampala deny.
North Kivu is one of the most densely populated regions in the DRC, and its basement is full of coveted mining resources.
In Bunagana, on the Ugandan side of the border, where some 5,000 people had taken refuge between Monday and Wednesday according to the UN, the movement back to the DRC that had started in the morning reversed at midday.
"This morning we crossed back to go to our fields, but the military told us to back off," Imelda Nyirankusi, surrounded by her nine children, including a baby on her back, told AFP.
It seems that the shootings are getting closer to the people.
In the early evening, dozens of residents crossed the border, some with a mattress on their heads, to spend the night in Uganda.
The musical comedy, this stage beast
Classic, sophisticated, popular, in English or French, the productions sung and danced take off.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally finds its voice.
It's a revolution: the French musical asserts itself as a genre of success.
For a long time, from Notre-Dame de Paris to Mozart’s opera rock, most of the attempts were fraught with ridicule.
And successes like Cabaret or Les Misérables carried the halo of mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin at Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet and of Stage Entertainment in Mogador changed the situation.
Today, these two scenes handle the titles like hit tubes.
The first one takes over, this Christmas, his excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the next world creation of "Un Américain <0xC3><0xA0> Paris".
In Mogador, "Beauty and the Beast" could well be one of the successes of the season.
On the other stages, musical performances such as "1789", "the lovers of the Bastille" and small musicals such as "Disco" or "Life and Times" are at the forefront of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Histoires de comedies musicales" and speaker at the Thé<0xC3><0xA2>tre du Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet, analyzes the reasons for the success so hard won.
How are French musicals evolving?
The offer has multiplied.
First of all, there are the "musical shows" that evolve according to the wishes of the producers...
Some use beautiful projections of images and a true story as in 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille.
Others make a fifteen-year jump back under the pretext that you can serve just about anything when you have Matt Pokora in the lead.
Then we have the musical comedies with the sumptuous productions of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>telet that make us relive the golden age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the greatest living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularizes variety Anglo-Saxon musicals by adapting them in French.
Independent French producers are trying to make a breakthrough.
But ongoing projects like "Rent", "The Kiss of the Spider Woman" or "The Spring Awakening" are struggling to be funded.
Do we have enough artists capable of singing, playing and dancing on Broadway?
In Paris, when there are eight musical shows in a season, it’s a great year.
We have 200 talented artists who turn projects into projects.
In the United States, the birthplace of musical comedy, it's very different.
Young people are trained in these professions in many schools.
There are many jobs among regional theaters, tours, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The talent pool is as important as the number of positions to fill.
Why are provincial tours so successful?
With the exception of the opera, the province remains the poor parent of culture in France.
Few theatre plays go on tour and it is often boulevard theatre intended for adults and not young adults.
Musical performances fill this shortcoming.
These are the same young people who love reality TV and what it produces as ephemeral stars.
To propose beautiful young men (often talented) at the head of a musical show is the assurance of the enthusiasm of these young girls and often of their entire family.
The Facebook pages of these shows are skilfully maintained by professionals who answer questions.
These shows are highly anticipated when they arrive in a Zenith province.
The mayonnaise is grown in Paris and tasted by the provincials.
The show is designed to enter all the major theatres of France in the same form as in Paris.
A serious injury in an accident with a phantom driver in the ring of Brussels
A road accident caused a serious injury on Friday morning at around 5:30 am on the inner ring of Brussels at the height of Hoeilaart, in the direction of Waterloo.
A driver's car was hit by a phantom driver, who is unharmed.
The ring was closed to traffic until 9 a.m. at the scene of the accident, the time the road was cleared and an expert determined the circumstances of the accident.
This situation, however, did not cause any traffic jams as the accident took place at the Hoeilaart exit.
The circulation could therefore be diverted by this output/input of the ring.
A seriously injured child in an attraction at Disneyland Paris
A five-year-old boy was seriously injured in an accident at a Disneyland Paris attraction.
His vital prognosis is no longer engaged but he is still hospitalized.
At the time of the fall, the boy was with his father on a boat from the attraction "Pirates of the Caribbean".
It was closed until further notice.
DRC: the army is preparing a new attack
Children play on a carbonized armored vehicle that belonged to the M23 rebels in Kibumba, eastern DRC, on October 31, 2013.
The Congolese army was preparing on Friday for a new assault on the last strongholds of the M23 rebels near Bunagana in eastern DRC.
The goal is to dislodge the M23 from the hills overlooking Bunagana.
Yesterday, we took the Bugina hill, which overlooks that of Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi should fall on her own.
Only Runyonyi Hill will remain.
"The one in Chanzu is not very strategic," North Kivu Governor Julien Paluku told AFP.
Mr. Paluku is scheduled to visit Bunagana on Saturday.
Political fief and last stronghold of the rebellion, this locality is located on the Ugandan border, about 80 km north of Goma.
It was recaptured on Wednesday by the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo on Wednesday.
Since then, a few hundred unreducibles from M23 have been cut off almost 2,000 meters above sea level on the agricultural hills of Chanzu, Runyonyi and Mbuzi, close to Bunagana and the neighboring town of Jomba.
In Jomba, a resident who had reported close fighting Thursday throughout the day said the situation was "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and her child were killed by the fighting the day before and were buried.
One girl was shot, and three others were injured, including one seriously, evacuated by the FARDC, said the witness quoted by AFP.
Since the resumption of fighting between FARDC and rebels on 25 October, the two belligerents have not given an assessment of the loss of human lives.
NSA disclosures increase paranoia of companies over state surveillance
On a beautiful day at the end of August, a German police helicopter flew over the British Consulate in Frankfurt, the financial capital of Germany, at low altitude.
By order of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), the German national intelligence agency, its mission was to photograph the roof of the American outpost, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
The German media explained that the BfV hoped to identify the presence of listening antennas and that the operation prompted an exchange between the United States and the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, the director of U.S. intelligence services, again insisted in September that the U.S. is not using its foreign intelligence capabilities to “steal the industrial secrets of foreign companies on behalf of U.S. companies in order to increase their international competitiveness or increase their profits.”
But since Edward Snowden, the whistleblower-turned-consultant, began revealing his inexhaustible treasure trove of information about U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and business leaders no longer know whether to believe the director on parole.
Reports that the U.S. National Security Agency has been spying on Brazilian oil company Petrobras and has had access to data held by U.S. cloud storage service providers, including Google and Yahoo, have more than ever sparked corporate paranoia about state surveillance.
The revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s phone had been hacked, perhaps even for a decade, was the drop of water that overflowed the vase.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are surely also potential targets.
Snowden has made the intensive collaboration between U.S. intelligence services and companies transparent.
I believe it is conceivable that this data be used in their mutual interest.
“Germany needs to wake up,” says Oliver Gr<0xC3><0xBC>n, president of BITMi, which represents German SMEs in the IT sector.
German companies believe the U.S. poses as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey published in July by consulting firm EY.
However, in all the documents disclosed by Mr. Snowden, there is no indication to date that the United States has transmitted industrial secrets from foreign companies to American companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU does not have sufficient IT and Internet capabilities and believe that it should strive to reduce its dependence on the United States.
Business leaders are sceptical about this.
A member of the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly.
“This is not the right way to do it,” says Hasso Plattner, president of the German enterprise software company, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then we shouldn’t have let it die 20 years ago.
Everything is subsidized in Germany, from coal to cars, to farmers.
Anything but the IT industry.
Yet the scale and sophistication of U.S. spy agencies exposed by Snowden’s revelations have been a shock to some companies that until then thought China posed the biggest surveillance risk.
A major change is taking place in cloud computing since European officials have become aware that data stored in the United States is governed by the laws of that jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a professional organization, some 10% of non-US members have given up their plans to use a US cloud storage service provider after revelations about the US Prism data mining program.
Jim Snabe, co-director of SAP, said: “Our customers are asking us today a question they didn’t ask us a year ago: where is my data stored and can you guarantee that it will remain physically in that jurisdiction?”
Many German leaders point out that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that the powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that this data must therefore be kept at all costs.
It is not surprising that there is economic espionage.
There's always been one.
“This has been a recurring topic for many years and nothing has fundamentally changed in the current discussion,” said Kurt Bock, CEO of the chemical company BASF.
Americans are spying on us commercially and industrially just as we are spying on them, because it is in the national interest to defend our businesses.
Business leaders are generally reluctant to disclose the preventive measures they have put in place, in case this would give an advantage to an opponent.
Big companies have long been hammering out the message that it is at least unwise to retrieve a free USB key at a professional salon or leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, a member of the board of directors of the car manufacturer Audi, says that collecting mobile phones before board meetings, so that they cannot be used as remote listening devices, has been a common practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to consider using simple prepaid mobile phones when traveling abroad due to the risk of harm to the integrity of smartphones.
Prepaid mobile phones are then discarded.
However, there are concerns that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to piracy and surveillance.
In Germany, many SMEs are world leaders in their particular niche.
“SMEs often lack the experience, personnel and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets from unauthorized access,” the BfV said in a report.
The United States is alerting its own companies to economic espionage activities by other countries.
The National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, cited France, as well as Russia and Israel, guilty to the second degree of having committed acts of economic intelligence hacking, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
A member of the board of directors of a well-known German company believed that when it comes to economic espionage, “the French are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, former director of French domestic intelligence, DCRI, said in an interview this month: “The services know perfectly well that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, are spying on their allies.”
Parents of Georgia teen, who died in unusual circumstances, think their son was murdered
The parents of a Georgia teenager, whose body was found in a treadmill in his high school gymnasium, believe their son was murdered, the family lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta, Georgia, was found on Jan. 11 stuck in a rug backed up behind the gymnasium steps of his high school.
Lowndes County Sheriff’s investigators concluded that Johnson had died under unusual circumstances, but the 17-year-old’s family disputes these findings.
“They are absolutely certain that their son was murdered,” Benjamin Crump, the lawyer representing Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as indicated in the sheriff's findings.
“They think it defies all logic, the laws of physics as well as common sense,” Crump added.
They are convinced that these conclusions were delivered for the sole purpose of covering the person(s) responsible for the death of their son.
“They sent their son to school with a paper bag and were returned to them in a death bag,” he added.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday that he is conducting an official investigation into Johnson's death, stressing that several important questions remain unanswered.
What is the cause of death?
Is his death the result of a criminal act?
Moore spoke at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I'll follow the facts, wherever they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
"I believe there is a sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the first autopsy indicated that Johnson had died from “positional asphyxiation.”
However, a second autopsy identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
“Several questions still deserve an answer or confirmation,” he said.
Moore added that if he uncovers evidence to justify a civil or criminal investigation into Johnson’s death, he will ask the FBI to conduct it.
The representative from the Lowndes County Sheriff's Office was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted him on Thursday.
A judge in South Georgia on Wednesday ordered authorities to hand over all video surveillance footage that investigators had examined.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the video footage contained clues to the circumstances of her death.
CDC Releases Advice on Children's Allergies to Schools
On Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a series of guidelines on how to manage children’s food allergies at school.
This is the first set of guidelines the U.S. government has published, as the number of school-age children with food allergies has soared.
One in 20 children in the United States today suffers from a food allergy.
The CDC found that the prevalence of food allergies in children increased by 18% between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to sensitize the faculty and staff to food allergies in the child, and how to treat them in the event of an allergic reaction.
He also recommends schools have a stock of epinephrine – the most commonly used EpiPen-branded auto-injector – to be able to respond quickly to potentially fatal anaphylaxis.
State legislatures have recently updated regulations to make it easier for schools to have epinephrine in stock.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children can say, “I feel like something is pricking my tongue,” “I feel like I have a hair on my tongue,” or “I have prickings on my tongue.”
The NSA case highlights the total absence of debate on intelligence
How to explain the contradictory attitude of the French government, which on the one hand offends in public by summoning the U.S. ambassador on October 21, and on the other prohibits the overflight of the territory by the Bolivian presidential plane, on the basis of the rumor of the presence on its board Edward Snowden?
In my opinion, there are two levels of response from the French government.
When Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Hollande calls Barack Obama or when Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius summons the U.S. ambassador, they react to a real discovery, which is the extent of U.S. surveillance on all communications in France.
Isn't it surprising to read in the columns of the World a few weeks apart, on the one hand, the reproduction of the American diplomatic correspondence and, on the other hand, a condemnation of the NSA's listening to the Quai d'Orsay?
Wouldn't it be like a wave of hypocrisy on your part?
The journalistic approach is not a moral position, but the search for the interest and relevance of information that allows every citizen to form an opinion.
When WikiLeaks lifts the veil on U.S. diplomacy’s analysis of political and other issues around the world, we believe that, in the eyes of U.S. power, this is an important light.
When we describe the American interception systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is by no means to be ashamed of this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Has France benefited from information provided by the NSA regarding terrorist operations targeting our interests?
Is it possible to deprive ourselves of American cooperation?
The establishment of powerful technological interception tools by the United States, but also by France, has been officially justified by the fight against terrorism.
Moreover, in this area, France and the United States have in particular put in place procedures for cooperation and exchange of information on an almost daily basis, which are described on both sides as essential.
For example, the presence of Mohammed Merah in the tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to the French thanks to the means of the NSA.
France can be led, for example, to transmit entire blocks of data on the Sahel region to American services, and, in return - as has already been said quickly - the Americans can give information to the French about other regions of the world.
So the underlying issue behind this NSA case is not so much the ability or right of countries to equip themselves with interception tools, as the question of the total absence of prior debate, particularly within parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the scope that must be theirs, and, ultimately, the question of violations of freedoms.
What is the real risk of the United States – a deterioration in its image?
I don't see how they can be punished.
The risk faced by Americans can be twofold.
The first is when their allies - and this has been the case recently - learn that their leaders, sometimes at the highest level of their state, have been monitored.
This is the case with Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been strained.
Another effect may be more economic: more and more European or South American companies are reluctant, in light of the revelations, to entrust their confidential data to US service providers subject to US laws, and therefore under the influence of the NSA.
Last but not least, the vast movement of revelations by media outlets around the world, which is helping to spark a debate on hitherto virtually non-existent intelligence surveillance practices, could push lawmakers, including the United States, to reconsider the powers they have given their intelligence services.
Parents of intersex children can choose “indeterminate sex”
Germany became the first European nation to recognize a third sex for infants born with ambiguous sex organs.
The male or female sex of the newborns will no longer be rigidly assigned to them at birth.
Under the new law, parents will no longer be required to declare their child’s sex, allowing them to register an “indeterminate” or “unspecified” sex on their birth certificate.
The purpose of the law was to remove the pressure on the shoulders of parents who could make hasty decisions regarding sexual reassignment surgery for their infant, and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
According to the BBC, an intersex person would have said years later, “I’m neither a man nor a woman.”
I will remain the patchwork created by the doctors, bruised and embalmed.
It is estimated that one out of every 2,000 children born each year is neither a boy nor a girl.
They are intersex, intersex being part of the group of sixty diseases diagnosed as disorders of sexual development, a generic term referring to people with atypical chromosomes or gonads (ovaries or testicles) or abnormally developed sexual organs.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersex.
Sexual identification is still not well understood, but most specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best information available to attribute it, then wait and follow the child's psychological and physical development before considering a surgical act, if any.
Dr. Jack Drescher, a psychiatrist in New York who specializes in sexual identification issues, said the new German law “seems to be a good idea.”
Intersex children pose an ethical dilemma.
“Some people suffer from extremely serious diseases that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children,” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual assignment without surgery, and see how the identity develops.
The science of how a child will develop a sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question of why this happens.
It's like the mystery that surrounds gay people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described intersex people as different from transsexual or transgender people, since their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively that of a man nor exclusively that of a woman, but is generally both at the same time and not clearly defined as being either.
These characteristics can manifest themselves in secondary sexual characteristics (such as muscle mass, hairiness, breast and stature), primary sexual characteristics (such as reproductive organs and sexual organs), or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in employment, as well as the extent of harassment and violence and crimes motivated by prejudice.
Non-compliant young boys now have camps specifically designed for them.
Australia and Nepal already allow adults to register male, female or “third sex” on their official documents.
In June, a 52-year-old Australian woman, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to be recognized as “neutral” after winning her appeal lawsuit that allowed her to keep an “unspecified” sex for life.
German passports will carry a third designation alongside M or F – X for intersex, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still the subject of controversy, according to a report broadcast on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of legislators from this fundamentally Catholic country signed a petition for the “gender theory” to be removed from school books.
The American website Catholic Online also opposed German law, writing that “since the world is dragged into a new realm where gender is a choice but sexual activity is not one, two other pillars of civilization are overthrown.”
In Maryland, the mother of an infant also said on Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be attributed to babies at birth.
“The role of parenting is stressful enough without any additional restrictions, especially if you don’t know your child’s gender,” she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and certainty.
Historically, children born without male or female sexual organs were called hermaphrodites, after the name of the magnificent Greek god who had a double sex.
And barely a decade ago, the medical community regarded gender as a slate, which can be erased and redrawn.
But now, many are questioning the ethical foundation of surgery, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes doctors can be wrong, not knowing how a child will feel his sexual reassignment when he grows up.
“In the mid-20th century, this was called a psychiatric emergency,” Drescher said.
When these children were born, they didn't call the psychiatrist, they called the surgeon.
The dominant theory on how to treat children with ambiguous sexual organs was launched by Dr. Johns-Hopkins University’s Johns Money, who considered the genre malleable.
He coined the term “sexual identity” and argued that social and environmental cues — the way parents raise a child — interact with a child’s genes and hormones to shape it so that it is identified as male or female.
But in a 1966 case, known as “John/Joan,” his theories gave rise to controversy.
He had advised the parents of a little boy whose penis had been cut during a shaky circumcision to castrate him entirely, also removing his testicles, and raising him as a girl.
“Money presented this as a successful transition case, but it wasn’t,” Drescher said.
At the age of about 15, he became a boy again and married a woman.
At the age of 38, he committed suicide.
Drescher said that some doctors “always repeat this pattern.”
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, those who survived these sex change operations say “[that] they’re not satisfied with the result.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes but ambiguous sexual organs.
Doctors couldn’t really say if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced he could never have a “satisfactory life” as a man.
So shortly after his birth in 1976, Bruce underwent a surgical removal of the external organ and testicles and was raised as a girl.
She was given female hormones at the age of 12.
“I knew I wasn’t a girl,” he told ABCNews.com.
I was not happy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At the age of 18, he underwent a vaginoplasty.
But depressed and realizing that something was wrong, he asked for his medical record.
What he discovered horrified him.
I was sterilized at birth – and no one ever told me.
Bruce was born with a sexual development disorder (DDS) that prevented his body from producing enough testosterone for his sex organs to develop.
After learning the truth, he became a man again, following a testosterone treatment and had his breasts removed.
The surgery made him sterile.
Today, he defends the cause of others in an organization called the Interface Project, which tries to normalize the perception of intersex people.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, CEO of the California-based nonprofit Advocates for Informed Choice, fears that German law “invites labeling and stigmatization.”
“Many activists worry that German law encourages parents to make quick decisions and give their child an ‘undetermined’ sex,” she said.
We are afraid that it will encourage interventions.
We think it would be better to assign a male or female sex, and wait.
But we did not see what the law was going to give, so we can only make assumptions.
Tamar-Mattis said her organization supports Australian law because it “allows adults to choose to be recognized as third gender.”
“Adults should be able to make their own decisions about a legal gender,” she added.
German law deals with the attribution of sex at birth.
This is not a battle that young children should be fighting at that age.
When they grow up, they will be able to make decisions about their own bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a radiologist specializing in mammograms in Pittsburgh, whose daughter is suffering from a sexual development disorder and who helps thousands of people in a support group, said the German law will “accountable” parents and children.
Dr. Baratz’s daughter, Katie, was born with male chromosomes, but suffers from a DDS called complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.
Due to the failure of its androgen receptors, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus or ovaries.
Today, 29-year-old Katie is married and interned in child psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although sterile, she hopes to have children through adoption services or surrogate mothers.
“The law leaves some latitude for parents not to have to make hasty decisions,” Baratz said.
This gives them time to take certain tests and understand them, and a time limit before entering "male" or "female".
So, everything is fine – you can raise your child and love him.
You have a beautiful baby and enjoy the pleasure of being a parent.
You do not have to rush for surgery that is irreversible.
“This puts children at the heart of the decision and attenuates the feeling of anxiety that motivates parents because they are afraid of not doing the right thing,” she said.
Finally, the child will decide which sex he/she feels most comfortable with – and that’s a great thing.
This allows the child to make the decision for himself.
Letta confident in the longevity of her government
Italian Council President Enrico Letta says his government will hold until 2015 despite strong left-right tensions within the ruling coalition as the Senate votes to scrap Silvio Berlusconi from his term.
In an interview with the daily La Stampa, the center-left leader said he had "firmly intended" to continue to govern with his coalition until the next legislative elections in 2015.
The upper house of the Italian parliament will meet later this month to decide the fate of the former President of the Council convicted of tax fraud in August.
Silvio Berlusconi threatens to withdraw his support for the government if the Senate, where he has more opponents than supporters, declares his impeachment.
But part of his camp, grouped around the National Secretary of the People's Freedom (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continues to support the government, as demonstrated on October 2 last his refusal to yield to the injunctions of Berlusconi who already wanted to bring down the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that an agent of the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency, TSA, and a suspect were injured during the exchange of shots.
Firefighters called at the scene of the tragedy claimed to have responded to a call stating "multiple wounded".
“The security forces are on the scene,” the airport said on its Twitter account, as television footage showed people evacuated in ambulances.
“There was a shooting,” a spokesman for the U.S. Transportation Safety Agency (TSA) told AFP.
ABC's local antenna showed one person evacuated on a stretcher, and a second person transported on a wheelchair.
The incident occurred at about 9:30 a.m. local time (12:30 a.m. in Montreal) at Terminal 3 of the airport, the airport also said.
The Los Angeles Times reports that Terminals 2 and 3 are being evacuated.
The TSA spokesman was unable to confirm immediately whether any of his employees were injured.
All flights on arrival and departure from the airport have been suspended.
Israeli Army Kills Hamas Member in Gaza Shed
Israeli tank fire on Thursday killed one Palestinian Islamist militant from Hamas and seriously injured another in the southern Gaza Strip, health officials said.
A Hamas source explained that fighting broke out in the region as Israeli tanks crossed the border and were targeted by your Palestinian mortar fire.
The Israeli military has merely referred to a "targeted action" in the area near a tunnel described as a "terrorist" by the Hebrew state, dug at the border and the discovery of which was announced in mid-October.
Report: Obama’s Campaign Considered to Drop Biden for Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama’s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to the New York Times.
This revelation is the most significant event that appears in the highly anticipated 2012 campaign book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times obtained a copy of the book to be published and told Thursday night that the president’s close associates had conducted “deep group work and surveys at the end of 2011” to see if Biden’s eviction could help Obama with his re-election as his hopes dwindled.
According to Times political correspondent Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of senior campaign and White House officials, former White House Secretary-General Bill Daley, to measure the effect the replacement of the vice president by former Secretary of State Clinton could have on the election.
The possibility of an exchange is a secret that has been fiercely guarded within the Chicago campaign HQ and within the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen close advisers to the president — including Daley, former Obama campaign chief Jim Messina and former White House advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe — knew the change was under consideration.
“Double Down” says Daley led the charge to replace Biden, despite their “close personal ties,” before finally deciding against the change when the numbers showed that having Clinton on the presidential list “did not significantly improve Obama’s chances of success.”
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
“I said I had looked at a whole series of questions, and that was one of them,” Daley told the newspaper.
Remember that at that time, the president wasn’t in shape, so we were like, “Lord, what can we do?”
While Daley called the review “concerted,” Martin told CNN’s Anderson Cooper that the re-election campaign had invested heavily in finding out if the change would be beneficial in the election.
“The campaigns don’t spend a lot of money on polls and discussion groups unless they seriously consider taking action,” Martin said on AC360.
However, it is not known whether Obama was aware that his team was considering the replacement.
Martin said on CNN that he had asked Daley if his then boss was aware of the possible overhaul.
Although Daley said he did not think the president "was aware" of the possible change, the former secretary general admitted that it was "possible" that Obama knew.
Martin added that “Double Down” did not definitively answer the question of whether political polls had arrived at Obama’s office.
Cooper asked Martin if he seriously thought Obama didn’t know Biden’s eviction from the presidential list was under consideration.
“Perhaps,” Martin replied.
Do you want a fluo ice cream?
A British entrepreneur has created the world’s first jellyfish-based fluorescent ice cream.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop a luminescent snack.
He came up with the idea after reading a study on jellyfish and convinced Chinese scientists to chemically recreate the brilliant protein.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue by increasing the pH of the protein to make it glow.
Chris explains that since the ice cream starts to glow when it reacts to the heat of the mouth, the more you lick, the brighter it becomes.
Charlie, the founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, said: "It's something incredible but we're only just getting started in terms of production, and 2g of this stuff costs around <0xC2><0xA3>200."
The protein we use in the ice reacts with the tongue at neutral pH.
So when your mouth warms up the protein, the pH level increases and the ice starts to glow.
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed appropriate to share it with everyone at Halloween time as it gives an extraordinary brilliant effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made because the luminescence of jellyfish is four times more expensive than gold.
Each ball costs me about <0xC2><0xA3>140.
But it tastes pretty good!
Charlie's experimental company, based in Bristol, is known for its unusual ice cream scents such as beer, cheese, beef and gold leaf.
But his next creation is even more ambitious.
He added: “I would really like to develop an invisible ice.”
This is intrinsically impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream, but I think I will find a way to get there.
Ice uses the fluorescent properties of jellyfish synthesized by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a tai chi session.
Singer Lou Reed died while doing tai chi exercises, his wife Laurie Anderson revealed Thursday in a letter published by the regional newspaper "East Hampton Star" and intended for residents of the city of Springs, where the couple had a home.
The artist died last Sunday at the age of 71.
“He died Sunday morning, as he watched the trees and performed the famous 21st Tai Chi movement, with his hands of musicians cracking the air,” writes Laurie Anderson.
Lou Reed was a master of tai chi, a Chinese martial art.
The singer's wife also explains that she had promised her husband, the week before his death, to get him out of the hospital and take him to their home in Springs, Long Island.
Lou and I have spent a lot of time here in the last few years.
And even if we are city dwellers, it is our spiritual home.
“He was a prince and a fighter, and I know his songs about the pain and beauty of the world will convey to many people the tremendous joy of living that he had.”
Lou Reed had a liver transplant last May.
Halloween 2013: In figures
When I was a kid, Halloween was magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, go to bed late and dress up to go to the neighborhood.
Today, I have become more pincer.
For the last two years, I haven’t distributed a single candy and I certainly won’t do it again this year.
But the stats show that I'm the gallant sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans – 158 million of them in fact – will be celebrating Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I look forward to at every Halloween party are the trends.
The disguises are expected to represent $1.2 billion out of the $6.9 billion spent, according to the NRF.
This year, sexy inanimate objects are raging.
Women no longer need to be sexy professionals; they can also be sexy foods like pizzas, hamburgers, and carrots.
As for men, I expect to see a lot of zombies, thanks to the TV series The Walking Dead, and I bet the men in the Daft Punk space will be among our Instagram photos this year.
According to Google, the most popular costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's no harm in staying traditional.
We dressed up our dogs last year and, to my surprise, they weren’t the only ones.
In fact, Americans are going to spend $330 million on animal costumes this year, according to the NRF.
It makes a lot of curious dogs dressed in hotdogs.
When it comes to candy, we don't sneeze.
Americans will spend $1.9 billion on candy this year, according to Nielsen.
This represents approximately 272 million kg of Hershey bars, suckers, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
This is great news for the 41 million children who go candy hunting in their neighborhood, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, let's not tell stories, consume 41 million pounds of chocolate during Halloween.
Corn candies are the only thing you don’t want to eat; yet nearly 16 million pounds are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confectioners Association.
This represents about 9 billion grains of corn.
It's a mystery I haven't figured out yet.
Nothing is more representative of Halloween than haunted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls" (which is actually a real prison), "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
In fact, there are 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the U.S., which generate about $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes these awesome photos of you peeing on top of what your friends put on Facebook and you can’t take off and on which a guy you like well leaves a comment of the “holy” style.
Finally, let’s talk about pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to The Big Citroen when we were kids, and sculpting a lantern-shaped pumpkin is like decorating a Christmas tree – it’s something we’ve been doing since we were little.
Fortunately for us, the “baby-pump trend” didn’t start until last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us sculpted these potions and didn’t have to sit in them.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The lantern pumpkins that gently flicker on the porch of your home probably came from Illinois, where 542 million pumpkins were grown this year.
If you’re looking to get more noticed, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California, and try sculpting their 922kg pumpkin.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will in-house create a “bad bank” structure that brings together 38 billion pounds (45 billion euros) of the most risky assets, a measure designed to relax its relations with London and accelerate its reprivatisation.
The bank wants to reduce the proportion of doubtful assets in its balance sheet by 55% to 70% in the next two years and hopes to have completely cleared it within three years.
RBS also said it would file a provision for further write-downs of <0xC2><0xA3>4 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>4.5 billion over the quarter, a write-off related to the cantonment structure’s constitution.
RBS also specified that this internal restructuring would release from 10 to 11 billion pounds of capital, thus strengthening its capacity to lend.
The bank and London stressed that the "bad bank" would draw a line on the past, with the government in particular being accused of interfering in the management of RBS.
“We can now move forward, worry about the future and the 90 percent of assets that make up a really good bank and build a big bank for customers and for the UK,” McEwan said.
Land Rover Announces Sponsorship of Rally Series
The interior features bucket seats and 6-point harness belts, as well as an Intercom system.
Options include improved brakes, a service that gives access to Bowler Works mechanics, logistics support, and storage of the vehicle between two events.
Drew Bowler, the CEO of Bowler Motorsport, said: “The rally enthusiasts who join Bowler have changed.”
Not all of them are experienced, some are looking for excitement and adventure and realistic access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA, and we are convinced that it will be a new way to try different forms of rallying in the UK and internationally, and to prepare for the rigours and realities of rally raids.
We had a lot of fun developing the Defender Challenge vehicle – the championship is going to be really exciting.”
In addition, the Defender Challenge will offer a training and testing day in February and the opportunity to participate in events in the deserts of North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters were called to rescue a lost puppy after being stuck 15m above the ground on an unstable cornice in a career
Ruby, a cocker spaniel, had escaped after a minor road accident
She was spotted three days later by a person walking her dog stuck in the quarry.
Firefighters went down the cliff to retrieve the dog and save her from certain death.
A puppy was lucky enough to escape the worst after firefighters were called to retrieve him safely while he was perched 15m above the ground on the unstable protrusion of a cliff.
Ruby, a 9-month-old cocker spaniel, escaped from a road accident Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before being rescued in a career Wednesday.
Its owners, Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, went to Flappit's career in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and thanked the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had desperately searched for their lost dog and launched a call on social media sites after she disappeared in the career following a minor accident.
Around 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a sharp-eyed person who was walking his dog spotted Ruby on a cornice in the quarry, stuck 15 feet above the ground.
A technical rescue team from the Cleckheaton fire station rushed to the scene and came down as a reminder to rescue Ruby using an animal stretcher to transport her to the top of the cliff.
Technical relief specialist Andy Clayton said: “She was in a precarious situation.”
It was in the middle of the cliff, 15 m from the summit and 15 m from the ground.
She didn’t move at all during the rescue – she was frozen.
But she's fine now.
She ate cookies afterwards.
It was a very unusual call.
It's amazing that someone noticed the dog.
Technical relief specialist Peter Lau said: “Ruby was very lucky to get out of it unscathed.”
She could have been seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for a check-up; her general condition was satisfactory, apart from exhaustion and dehydration.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “I was terrified watching the rescue.”
At first I didn't think she was up there.
It was amazing to have him in my arms again.
The vet said that if she had been too exhausted and she had fainted, she would probably have fallen.
The firefighters were amazing.
What they did was really brave.
We are so grateful to them, each of them has been absolutely awesome.
Keighley’s Mr. Alderson added, “We were afraid she would fall, but she didn’t move.”
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe she was up there.
Mick Jagger says he never drugged Katy Perry when she was 18.
During an interview on an Australian radio show this week, the pop star stated that she was a chorister on Jagger's song "Old Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said he had dinner with the rock veteran and explained, “He drugged me when I was 18.”
She added, “It was a long time ago, and he was very kind.”
In a statement Thursday, a representative for Jagger, 70, said he “categorically denies making advances to Katy Perry.”
The representative added: “Perhaps she confuses him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the singers to make an appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
His new album, Prism, landed at number one on the charts this week.
Beijing calls into question an Islamic Turkmen movement
“The behind-the-scenes support for the attack came from the East Turkestan Islamic Movement based in Central and West Asia,” the head of Chinese security agencies told a Hong Kong television channel, according to a video posted on a website Thursday night.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), was speaking in Tashkent during an official visit to Uzbekistan.
This is the first time a Chinese official has appointed a special organization after Monday’s attack.
According to Chinese police, three Uighurs from the same family in the Muslim-dominated Xinjiang region, bordering several Central Asian countries, rushed their car loaded with gas cans against the entrance to the Forbidden City in Beijing, in a suicide attack that left two people dead and 40 injured.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the car fire.
The Etim, which claims to be fighting for the independence of East Turkestan, a former name for Chinese Xinjiang, was ranked by the United Nations in 2002 among Al Qaeda-affiliated organizations.
This movement is often designated by the Chinese authorities as being responsible for sporadic unrest in Xinjiang, but its real influence is questioned by several experts.
George Kerevan: The breakup of Europe gives the Scots a choice
Another day, another disturbing story of independence.
This time, we are being warned that an independent Scotland would have to join the European Free Movement Area in order to join the EU.
And here we hear stories of passport control in Berwick and a border of barbed wire along Hadrian's Wall.
While it is true that Strathclyde's newspaper indicated the potential economic benefits of greater freedom of movement with the rest of Europe, this was not included in the headlines (and it was to be expected).
Nor has anyone said that EU Member States spend much of their time circumventing their formal rules when it suits them.
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment, a continued non-compliance with the rules would be a thin concession that Brussels could offer in return for everything it wants from the Scots.
This is a story that is not one of them.
And a story so old that it is now frozen: I heard for the first time the bastard that “independence means passport control” more than 40 years ago.
Yet we have forgotten an interesting point in this interpretation of an old dusty tale.
Why should an independent Scotland follow the instructions of Europe, in fact?
Why trade the yoke of London for the yoke of Brussels, especially now?
Here is the real news about Europe: the great post-war plan to unify Europe is definitely dead-end.
With the euro crisis, Project Europe is officially dead.
Across Europe, parties that oppose the EU or campaign for the abandonment of the euro as a common currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded only this year and arriving from nowhere, gathered almost five million votes in the September federal elections and pulled out the Liberal Democratic Party (the equivalent of our Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been national opposition to the project of creating a federal Europe.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a turning point.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the burden on national economies through membership of the single currency, has led many people to think that Project Europe has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments recording excessive budget deficits – this was only true for Greece.
The European system has instead weighed on its members the exchange rates favorable to German exporters – what German politicians want to keep.
Without the possibility of devaluation of the national currency, the countries of southern Europe find themselves with an intrinsic productivity problem vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Germany.
The only recourse is to make dark cuts in wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin.
Beyond the current fiscal and monetary problems, there is a deeper unease related to productivity in Europe.
Following the “green” energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason to subsidize French and German energy companies at the expense of the consumer – European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as the United States.
This is a cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All of the world’s wage freezes will not prevent Europe’s petrochemical industry from being penalized by cheap U.S. shale gas.
As a result, the revolt rages, especially in France, one of the great leaders of the EU.
After the war, the French political elite saw the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on an equal footing with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a passport for its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, leaving the French economy to suffer.
The result: Marine Le Pen’s far-right party, the anti-European National Front, has just won a crucial by-election, returning the Socialists to power in third place.
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot start from the principle that a split of the right will automatically favor the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with its new popularity with the French white working class?
It wants to use next year’s European elections to create a single, anti-European anti-currency bloc within the European Parliament.
If anti-European parties play a good role in these elections, which is very possible, such a bloc could control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the anti-European and anti-single currency sentiment in Europe will unify and eventually kill the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will look more like a free “Europe of (sovereign) nations” favored by General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could keep the euro, but France and southern Europe will regain their own currency.
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project, and I hope it will make the United States look soft.
Washington's growing interest in the Pacific, however, suggests that Britain will be left behind in the Atlantic.
What about Scotland in all this?
We can decide to be a region of Little England (essentially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes sending walkers to Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Scotland could accommodate a freer European agreement on the condition that we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-federal Europe of nations.
Otherwise, we should imitate Norway and maintain our economic independence.
The Scottish SNP government is – and it should be noted – the most successful anti-austerity political movement in Europe, having won a spectacular majority in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed dark cuts (and implementations) by the Chancellor of the Labour chessboard, Alistair Darling, and the coalition that followed.
It would now be ridiculous for Scotland to vote for independence if it were to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Early Puberty: Aging Earlier
Studies show that African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
Physical Changes Don't Mean Puberty Is Imminent
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible.
Experts Think Obesity Epidemic Could Be a Trigger for Early Puberty
The trend towards early puberty is not as pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in family and child health issues.
Does a mother have to worry if her daughter’s pubic breasts and hair begin to grow at age 7 or 8?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics held this week in Orlando, Florida, Dr. Paul Kaplowitz, a pediatric endocrinologist, explained that these early physical changes are quite common among young Americans and represent a new norm.
“I spend a lot of time reassuring parents — in general, that doesn’t indicate a rapid shift toward full puberty,” Kaplowitz said.
Obvious signs of development, such as bulging breasts, hair under the arms and in the pubic area and body odors, appear earlier in girls.
But there has only been a slight advance in the age of the first rules over the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and a half, while it was 12 years three-quarters in 1970.
“Once the breast begins to develop, it takes at least two or three years before the first rules appear,” said Kaplowitz, also the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Coping with This Common Problem.”
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty will evolve.
There is a debate about what constitutes the actual onset of puberty, but it is considered "early" when breast development is accompanied by sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, the development slows down or stops – this is something a pediatrician can closely monitor.
Faster evolution may justify tests performed by an endocrinologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and prevent other consequences: premature aging of the bones that can slow growth and a small size in adulthood.
Recommendations for drug and hormonal treatment are based on the age of the child, the rate of development, the rate of growth and affective maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is cautious with medications but acknowledges that “controlling puberty can alleviate some behavioral problems and the feeling for young girls to be different from others.”
The other big problem is understandable: Parents simply don’t want their very young girls to have their own rules.
“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way they will handle hygiene issues,” Kaplowitz said.
“It was a shock,” recalls a woman whose daughter had her first rules at age 10.
Even though there were signs and we talked about the rules, it wasn’t emotionally prepared.
She came home from school scared and upset to be the first of her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public’s attention about the causes of early puberty.
Yet there is no consistent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment, or sexual messages conveyed by the media are responsible.
Boys, like girls, reach their puberty earlier.
Kaplowitz argues that the most credible hypothesis is that of the obesity epidemic.
He participated in a study conducted on girls aged 6 to 9 years that linked the percentage of fat mass to the onset of puberty.
Other findings support this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the age of puberty earlier than white girls.
There are various explanations.
Globally, the mechanisms of early puberty seem to be influenced by everything from economic conditions to climate, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have hair on their faces and in the younger pubic area, the trend towards true early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors attending the AAP conference emphasized the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of acne and pubic hair is common, even in infants and toddlers.
“We need to be careful about how we identify the true onset of puberty,” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist working at Goryeb Children’s Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
“This may mean having a conversation earlier than expected,” Kaplowitz said.
If you stay calm, your child will generally respond well.
Girls with early puberty need to be reassured that even when it happens earlier than expected, the process is part of life.
Tribute to the Folk of the Coen Brothers
"Inside Llewyn Davis" by the Coen brothers, Grand Prix of the last Cannes Film Festival, is a nostalgic and funny film about the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music that was just beginning to resonate there, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose filmography has just been the subject of a retrospective at the Cinémath<0xC3><0xA8>que fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise, had won the Palme d'Or at Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
In the absence of being able to hire Dylan or the trio Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have cast their spell on the rising star of American cinema, Oscar Isaac, 33, but also on the pop global star Justin Timberlake.
In this humorous film where music is a central character and songs performed live, Oscar Isaac reveals himself to be an accomplished folk musician and singer, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves pop for folk music with a contagious jubilation.
As for Carey Mulligan, she left Daisy Mulligan’s rich spells in “Gatsby the Magnificent” for less flamboyant clothes, a soft voice when she sings, but the swearing off of the machine gun when she speaks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells about a week the tribulations of a folk singer who can not penetrate and gets angry with the whole earth.
He accepts to back away the foot replacements raised in the studios.
Without housing, he makes the tour of the sofas of his friends who still want to receive him.
An air of documentary
“His relationship with success is tortured, that’s what interested us: a mixture of bad luck, a guy who is not there at the right time, who is not a careerist but integral, with self-destructive behavior,” said Ethan Coen, who has won several Oscars and awards with his brother Joel in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis didn’t exist, the two folk-music-fan filmmakers built their story on true figures of the time like folk musician Dave Von Ronk.
The idea was to show the moment before the advent of Greenwich Village, this New York neighborhood called to become "the epicenter of the rise of folk music that would spawn international stars" as the journalist Elijah Wald, a friend of Van Ronk, writes.
The film then takes on the look of a documentary, from the dusty 33T-invaded music label inhabited by an old unsold secretary, to the musical choices of the studios of the time and the cafes where the singers were performing.
The magic of the Coen brothers still works by incorporating a funny character who goes through the film all the time: a beautiful red cat with a cracking look, Llewyn Davis's companion of fortune.
Asked how he composed his character, actor and singer Justin Timberlake recalled having "growed up in Tennessee, bathed in blues and country."
“My first music lessons were given to me by my grandfather who taught me how to play the guitar,” he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if work is needed to “be considered good,” “coincidence can also launch someone’s career,” and “more and more today.”
Like Llewyn Davis who refuses to compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a career, "the most important thing is not to get caught up in anything that can prevent us from expressing ourselves."
Gérard de Villiers, the author of "SAS", is dead.
He never knew the word retirement.
The phenomenon of the French edition, Gérard de Villiers, who died Thursday at 83 years old, had just published his 200th SAS, "The Revenge of the Kremlin".
In February, The New York Times described him as "the author of spy novels who knew too much about it."
He had just spent ten days in Afghanistan, the theater of the 198th and 199th opus of the famous series of spy novels.
Physically reduced by a very serious heart attack in December 2010, he was travelling with a walker during this trip.
And before Afghanistan, he had also left for Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published per year, Gérard de Villiers, born on December 8, 1929 in Paris, made sure to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, nearly half a century ago.
“No doubt between 120 and 150 million of all countries combined,” he said in March.
His Burmese cat on his knees, in the living room of his huge apartment of a building on Foch Avenue, a stone's throw from the Arc de Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, he quoted some of the languages in which the adventures of SAS have been translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek or Japanese.
"Not counting pirate editions," he added, referring to a stack of books on the bottom table between the bronzes or ivorys reported from the 130 countries surveyed to locate his novels.
For the price of a pack of cigarettes, the reader is entitled to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman with an advantageous chest, carrying a gun or an assault rifle.
Inside, his serene Highness (SAS) Prince Malko Linge, a disenfranchised Austrian aristocrat and contract agent of the CIA to pay for the repairs of the family castle, embarks on the kits of all the villains of the earth, communists of the 70s and 80s, and then jihadists from the 90s.
With each book, the same recipe: a large dose of geopolitics and exoticism, a few scenes of hard sex, a handful of violence and torture.
"I never had the pretense of being a literary author," explained Gérard de Villiers.
I consider myself a storyteller who writes to distract people to whom I do not send a message.
He worked "like the great pre-war reporters, like Albert London, who went there and came back with real, long investigations."
The father of SAS said "make a kind of geopolitical soap opera".
"I'm constantly on my files (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before I leave," added Gérard de Villiers.
On the spot, I meet journalists, including those of AFP, diplomats, people of services that I have known for some for twenty or thirty years.
As a result, many of his SASs are often pre-monitored: thus, a month before the attack on a Syrian regime command center that killed several senior officials, he had told the story in "The Way of Damascus".
In "The Madness of Benghazi", he had been the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command center in this city, the birthplace of the Libyan uprising.
In 1980, he staged the assassination of Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadat in "The Cairo Plot", a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panic in Bamako", he reported the columns of 4X4 jihadists that were based on the Malian capital.
I am not a guess, defended Gérard de Villiers, I simply make assumptions from countries that I know well and, from time to time, some of my assumptions come true.
After these trips to often troubled areas, he settled for a month behind his 1976 IBM daisy typewriter "whose parts were all changed".
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page to the pen.
On the walls of his office are hanging assault rifles AK-47, erotic photos and photos of the author with African warlords.
Regularly pinned for machismo by feminist leagues and for racism by human rights organizations, Gérard de Villiers dismissed these accusations in two sentences.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and courageous women.
I am always welcome in Africa where I have many readers.
Gérard de Villiers had said it: "Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age."
He will not die and will not retire.
No more than me.
Aircrafters are arguing about the width of the seats while large orders are at stake
The dispute rages among major aeronautical manufacturers about the width of the seats of the tourist class on long-haul flights, paving the way for a bitter confrontation at this month’s Dubai aeronautical show.
The conflict concerns the breadth of seats offered on long-haul flights to economy class passengers – who are not always the most courted by airlines, but to whom the allocated space is essential to increase efficiency gains in the latest aircraft presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called on the aviation industry to put in place a standard imposing a seat size of at least 18 inches (45.72 cm) in the economy classes, but its major US rival Boeing says it should be up to the airlines to decide.
The dispute broke out as aircraft manufacturers sought to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft, possibly hoping for a record order intake at the event that will take place from November 17 to 21.
The way the seats will be arranged at the rear of the aircraft – in particular, will there be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the mini-jumbo segment.
Boeing says its redesigned 777X will accommodate 406 people in economy seats over 17 inches wide, and will be configured with 10 seats per row.
Airbus indicates that the competing version of its A350 will transport 350 people in economy class in 18-inch wide seats configured in rows of 9.
Aeronautics giants often trade blows on technical issues by advertising in the professional press.
Today, Airbus is directly appealing to the public ahead of the Dubai Air Show, where the 777X is expected to take over its competitors with more than 100 orders.
We were recently able to realize what could be the beginning of a new advertising war with the presentation to financiers of a photo showing three people against each other at the restaurant, entitled “Would you accept that?”.
“Boeing offers long-haul flights in narrower seats than in regional turboprop aircraft,” said John Leahy, Airbus Chief Commercial Officer.
As eating habits change, people get bigger, but the seats on airplanes haven’t changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when Boeing’s 747 jumbo defined modern long-haul travel, and the turn of the century, the average American’s weight from 40 to 49 years increased by 10%, according to U.S. Department of Health data.
The average American’s waist circumference in the 21st century is 39.7 inches, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is clinging to a seat concept that dates back to the 1950s, when the circumference of the newly named jet set was narrower.
Airbus adds that it commissioned a study that indicates that an extra inch of seat width would improve sleep quality by 53%.
Boeing disputes Airbus’ figures on seat width and says it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines balance ticket prices and equipment.
He also says the study shows that the cabin experience doesn’t just depend on the width of the seats.
“It’s really about bringing flexibility to airlines and enabling them to do what they think they need to do to get their business done,” said Kent Craver, Boeing’s passenger satisfaction manager.
They don’t want to be told what will make them profitable.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, it is more about having some freedom of movement, but for suppliers, it is increasingly a question that could affect their results.
Behind the dispute is a race to order aircraft worth an estimated $700 billion at market price in the coming decades, enough to tip the balance of U.S. and European exports.
As Reuters first pointed out in July, the configuration of the seats is exactly what fuels the battle between the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing both claim a performance per seat in their latest long-haul twin-engine models 20% higher than that of the market leader in this segment, the Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance announced by Boeing depends in part on the comparison between the configured 777X with 10 seats per row and an original 777 model configured in rows of 9.
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats per row currently in service.
“Boeing is doing this to be able to house more seats and make its aircraft more competitive with our products,” said Kevin Keniston, Director of Passenger Comfort at European aircraft manufacturer Airbus.
On the other hand, analysts say that cabins configured with 10 seats per row in the existing 777 suggest that many passengers are in favor of a denser configuration, which can go hand in hand with cheaper fares.
“An 18-inch seat width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that, from a commercial point of view, Airbus’ proposal is motivated by the threat of the 777,” said cabin interior expert Mary Kirby, founder and editor-in-chief of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats, but offer a catalog of suppliers from which airlines must choose.
Aircraft vendors that tour the world even take a meter with them to check out competing configurations.
While all manufacturers offer comfortable aircraft, they also offer aircraft with high-density configurations to low-cost airlines and for regional travel.
Airbus offers a configured A350 with 10 seats per row but indicates that it has not yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for more cabin customization by offering wider seats on the side of the aisle on some of its aircraft.
Without the support of the only other major manufacturer of large modern aircraft, experts say that it is unlikely that its call to the aviation industry to set a size standard for seats will result, but that it could cause it to forget the 777X sales wave.
Oracle Shareholders Irritated by Ellison's Salary
A majority of Oracle shareholders voted Thursday against the compensation proposal for founder and CEO Larry Ellison, given the financial performance of his group.
The vote is not binding but comes to tarnish the image of Larry Ellison, the third world fortune just heralded by the victory of his boat at the Cup of America.
The billionaire still owns 25 percent of the software group he co-founded 40 years ago.
Last year, Ellison had already received a negative vote on his salary.
Oracle’s boss waived a $1.2 million bonus for the fiscal year 2013 ended in May due to the group’s poor performance, which missed its growth targets, but he earned about $77 million related to stock options.
Its fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
Over the full year-over-year 2013, Oracle's net profit rose 3.5% while the stock market price jumped 27.5%, outperforming the S&P-500 index which took 24% at the same time.
New Nicotine Vaccine Could Eliminate the Pleasure of Smoking
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could suppress the pleasure of smoking a cigarette.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for life.
Further tests are needed before starting trials on humans, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first signs were encouraging.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, exhausting all the methods available on the market today, but find that their addiction is strong enough to overcome these different approaches,” Cornell said.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to carry the genetic information needed to design anti-nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the cells of the liver, which then begins to produce a regular flow of antibodies.
Antibodies track all the nicotine molecules in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the smoker from getting his dose of nicotine.
During the tests, the vaccinated mice who were then given nicotine continued their normal activity.
But mice that had not been vaccinated “were soothed,” the researchers said, a sign that nicotine had reached their brains.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines have been found to be ineffective because they contained antibodies.
Injections had to be repeated so frequently that antibody levels remained high that they were too expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be much lower as it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
Professor Crystal said that if the future human-use vaccine was completely safe, it could be administered to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, which would prevent any nicotine addiction.
But it is more likely to be used by smokers who want to stop smoking.
“They’ll know that if they start smoking again, they won’t take any pleasure in it because of the nicotine vaccine, and that can help them lose their bad habit,” he added.
British scientists said the results were interesting but reported that much more in-depth research was needed.
Pakistan's Taliban leader killed by drone
The leader of the Pakistani Taliban movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Pakistan on Friday, security officials said.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud has been announced several times in the past.
But intelligence officials, the army as well as the activist movement said this time that he had lost his life in this strike, carried out in the North Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike," a senior security official said.
The day before, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, on his way to London, had informed the British government that discussions had been initiated with Tehrik e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the Pakistani Taliban movement.
Tripodi nie be influenced by Obeid
Former New South Wales Labour Minister Joe Tripodi will be the subject of an investigation by the state’s anti-corruption regulator.
Former New South Wales minister Joe Tripodi has denied changing the commercial lease policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden interests in three properties located in the government-controlled area.
On Friday, the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) expanded its investigation into whether Mr. Obeid had pressured several ministers of state to renew their leases in Circular Quay, where the Obeid own two restaurants and a café, after their expiration in August 2005, without any tenders.
She is now investigating allegations that Mr. Tripodi was aware of Mr. Obeid's secret interest in these properties, following testimony by Mr. Tripodi's former Under-Secretary-General, Lynne Ashpole, on Thursday.
During the years of discussions that began in 2005, the government has pushed for leases to be tendered.
The tenants were against and also wanted longer durations.
In 2009, the leases for Circular Quay companies, which reported approximately $2.5 million to Obeid per year, were renewed without a call for tenders.
Mr. Tripodi, who served as Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was initially in favour of tenders.
But he denied having changed his policy at the request of Mr. Obeid, who acknowledged Mr. Tripodi, calling for a change in government policy on leases.
The transcript of telephone conversations submitted to ICAC showed calls made in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had arrived at the Ports Department after working under Mr. Obeid at the Fisheries Department.
“The topic discussed during these telephone conversations was the development of the commercial lease policy?” asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr. Tripodi.
“No,” replied Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but at least it wasn't that.
Certainly not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli Warplanes Target Syria, Official Says
Israeli warplanes hit a target in the Syrian port city of Latakia on Thursday night, a military official confirmed to Fox News.
The official did not specify what the target was, but said there was at least one.
The Associated Press reports that the target was Russian-made SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel conducted airstrikes on missile cargoes in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have to pass an “authenticity” test
The government is currently looking into the possibility of setting up a “authenticity” test for foreign workers holding a 457 visa as it plans to extend the crackdown.
The test, if adopted, would be applied according to a criterion designed to prevent 457 visas from being used to fill unqualified positions or as a diverted means to bring his family and friends to Australia.
A government working paper was unveiled today as Labour MP Maxine McKew denounced the government’s speech on foreign workers, saying it could offend Australia’s neighbors.
"Failureful statements about 'foreigners coming back at the end of the line' and 'jobs for Australians first' are an unpleasant return to a time when unions were demanding a protected labour market," she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant that the work of the Whites had to be protected – and I wouldn’t be surprised if some countries in the region see it as an echo of this historic artifact.
The working paper outlines the 12 measures that had previously been considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen.
Immigration Minister Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet with senior officials to discuss human trafficking, implemented five of the recommended changes, the others being reviewed.
If the “authenticity” criterion was adopted, a visa applicant could be checked to know “whether the job offer is genuine in the event that the applicant is a relationship or personal partner of the owner or person concerned within the sponsoring company”.
Companies may also be required to report the number of 457 visa holders after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, have actually employed hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker has reportedly died of a heart attack after arriving on a boat carrying asylum seekers to Christmas Island this week.
The man's 9-year-old son was travelling with him to Australia and has found some comfort since his father's death Wednesday with an adult cousin who was also on board.
The man was rushed by Australian authorities to the Christmas Island hospital, where he died.
A study to multiply the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland was launched by the British government.
The work carried out by HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed services to Scotland and northern England will start as soon as Phase 1 opens in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would “bring together the UK”.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was “excited” to work with the British government on the project.
Phase 1 will focus on a new high-speed rail line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is completed, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government revised up the estimated cost of building the high-speed link between London and northern England, from <0xC2><0xA3>32.7 billion to <0xC2><0xA3>42.6 billion.
The UK government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has asked HS2 Ltd to study rail capacity building and improved journey times for northern England and Scotland.
This should include the possibility of travelling between Glasgow and Edinburgh for a maximum of three hours.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that will bring the UK and its cities closer together.”
We are pushing the HS2 project because the benefits it presents are enormous.
Without it, we are faced with a capacity problem of our railway network.
But it is also about developing connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, so that the connections between them are better thanks to HS2.
British Secretary of State for Scotland Alistair Carmichael added: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland."
For the Scottish government, Keith Brown called on Mr Carmichael to support "unmistakably" Scotland's inclusion in the HS2 network.
Mr Brown said: "The high-speed train has the potential to deliver considerable economic benefits to Scotland, but it also brings the economic weight of Scotland into the overall high-speed rail network project across Britain.
“We are therefore excited to work in partnership with the UK Government to explore options to bring the high-speed rail network to Scotland, creating an advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edinburgh line that the Scottish Government is already planning.
“I look forward to reading the review report with the British ministers next year and we will then decide together on the next steps.”
The rules on the use of electronic devices on board remain in force in Australia for the time being.
Australian air passengers will have to continue to turn off their tablets and smartphones during take-off and landing despite the U.S. move to ease regulations on electronic devices.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration has left the door open for U.S. carriers to change their procedures so passengers can read e-books, watch videos, or play games on their aircraft during critical flight phases provided they are in “aircraft” mode.
Passengers can already do so during most of the flight, but many people find it painful not to be able to access their e-books during take-off and landing.
The Australian carriers are reviewing the decision, which obliges US carriers to carry out significant work to meet the requirements, but have indicated that they do not intend to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also said it was reviewing the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices during critical flight phases were still in place in Australia.
“CASA does not have specific regulations governing the use of electronic aircraft,” she said.
The issue is subject to regulations that require aircraft operators to ensure that safety is maintained at all times and passengers to comply with the safety instructions given by crew members.
Virgin, who has already spoken to CASA about her intention to extend the use of her on-board entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology, was open to a change, but said she would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a CASA review that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think it would improve the customer experience now that we have (the onboard entertainment system using Wi-Fi technology) on our aircraft,” a spokesman said.
Qantas said it currently complies with the current rules.
“In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices cannot be used during take-off and landing, and we have no intention of changing that immediately,” she said.
The FAA decision applies to U.S. airlines.
However, we are still interested in regulatory developments that could benefit passengers, and we will look closely at the FAA’s decision and the reasons for it.
For U.S. carriers, the impact of the decision will vary from airline to airline and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Carriers will need to demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from electronic devices, as well as review of manuals, training equipment, hand luggage transportation programs and instructions provided to passengers.
“As soon as an airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use lightweight portable electronic devices, such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at all altitudes,” the FAA said.
In rare cases of low visibility, the crew will ask passengers to switch off their aircraft during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier aircraft be safely stored under the seats or in the upper compartments during take-off and landing.
Pia: at least four injured in violent fight
The small town of Pia experienced an unusual excess of fever on Thursday night.
Three gendarmerie vehicles, two ambulances and a crowd of about thirty people according to the testimonies collected...
On this Halloween day, the evening was agitated on the side of Pia where a quarrel involving several people broke out on the side of the Post Office.
At least four minor injuries would be to be regretted.
Alerted, the gendarmes went to the scene to separate the belligerents and ensure that the wounded were taken care of.
Singapore’s lenders take advantage of the middle classes forced to tighten their belts
Janani Amirthalinga, a pledge lender at Singapore’s Bendemeer shopping centre, deposits a bracelet, ring and a pair of gold earrings to pay for her daughters’ tuition.
“My husband and I just bought a house so all my money went into it,” says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns $3,000 from Singapore ($2,400) per month as an administrator and her husband also works, monthly family income is not enough, she says.
In fact, the demand is such in some parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – that ValueMax, where it conducted its transaction, became the third pledge lending company to be introduced on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Securing jewelry is not only a quick way to get cash – $1,300 from Singapore in Ms. Amirthalinga’s case – but it’s almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans.
In general, Singapore's pledge lenders charge an effective annual interest rate of 17%, just above the 15.4% offered by the United Overseas Bank, a local lender with a branch in the same mall.
However, lenders on pledge have the advantage of not asking for a solvency check or proof of salary, and can unlock loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people across the region are turning to mortgage lenders as families feel the pressure of increasing the cost of living and over-indebtedness of households and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and cheap credit fueled by overly lax monetary policy in advanced economies, low- and middle-income families turn to pledge lenders to bridge the gap as their economies slow down.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's cited rising household debt, mainly a result of rising mortgage loans, as a risk factor for the solvency of Asian banks.
It stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore recorded Asia's highest household debt-to-GDP ratio.
Malaysia tops the list with 80 per cent of GDP, up from 60 per cent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand, which just emerged this week from a technical recession.
On Thursday, data showed a continued weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
“The bottom line is that with rising costs, people in the middle or bottom [of the wage scale] are looking to supplement their income as much as they can,” said Song Seng Wun, an economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historically high gold prices over the past two years have caused people to rush to pledge their personal belongings to touch the cash value of their jewelry.
In Singapore, about 70% of the items pledged in the city-state’s 200 pledge lending shops are in gold.
People say, "The price of gold is high, let's pledge the grandmother's gold chain and we'll come back for it next month."
In Thailand, EasyMoney, the largest provider of loan-on-guarantee shops, has seen a 20% increase in the number of customers using its stores in recent months.
The rise is such in the bond lending sector that ValueMax, operator of the Bendemeer store and 15 other stores like this one in Singapore, plans to grow not only in neighboring Malaysia – where it already has four stores – but also outside Asia, says Yeah Lee Ching, its CEO.
The company will fund them using 60% of the 66 million Singapore dollars it raised this week when it was introduced on the Singapore Stock Exchange.
While some low-rate lenders have faced criticism for the exorbitant interest rates they practice, Ms. Yeah points out that the pledge not only offers lower rates than other lenders, but also does not directly raise debt.
“Customers are mortgaged on assets they already own, and monetizing their personal assets does not increase household debt,” she says.
The pledge is increasingly socially accepted as a means of securing guaranteed funding in the short term.
The people who go to the lenders on the pledge are also not only those who have financial problems.
Wealthy people in Singapore also go to ValueMax pawnshops to pledge gold bullion or Rolex watches, which can account for up to 60% of their cash purchase price.
We see customers from all walks of life.
“It could be wealthy people who need to borrow in the short term for business or investment, or small businesses who have cash needs to move on a difficult path,” Ms. Yeah adds.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
Pastor Accused of Child Pornography in Nova Scotia
A youth pastor in the Halifax area of Nova Scotia has been charged with child pornography.
Aaron Hudgins, 30, was arrested Friday morning following searches at his home and the National Research Council office where he works.
The Baptist church in Timberlay, where the pastor was officiating, said it was deeply saddened by the news.
In a statement, church officials said Mr. Hudgins resigned from his post.
The pastor was released on condition.
In particular, it must not communicate with persons under the age of 18 and not access the Internet.
He will appear in a provincial court in Halifax in December.
He goes in a Nazi uniform to the supermarket, before being chased out of it.
A man dressed in a Nazi uniform barricaded with an armband with the swastika was asked to leave an English supermarket, customers complaining to the management of the establishment that called the police, the store said Friday.
"We have received several complaints from customers, so we asked him to leave the store," a spokeswoman for supermarket chain Asda said.
The store called the police for rescue, but "by the time it arrived, it had already left without a hitch," she added.
I was doing the tail when I saw a woman who seemed upset.
The people were dumb.
“You don’t go out on the street like that unless you want to get attention,” a customer, Rosina Rusin, 60, told Cambridge News.
This incident occurred on Thursday, Halloween Day, where it is customary to dress up as a monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a hoax.
A Cambridge man claimed responsibility for the act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
“I’ve been wearing an SS black armband twice a week for three years at Asda,” Dutton said, explaining he suffers from “mental problems.”
A $325 million rescue plan for Tasmania's health system
The federal government maintains that the $325 million bailout plan for the faltering health care system comes with strict conditions to ensure that the state government does not waste funds.
Federal Minister of Health Tanya Plibersek announced that the Commonwealth is taking “urgent steps” to end a crisis caused by the aging population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the constraints of the system.
The funding, planned for four years, was decided after government consultations with Tasmanian Independent MP Andrew Wilkie.
“The government has proposed an emergency rescue plan that we believe will address the unique challenges the state is facing,” Plibersek said today.
The $325 million plan includes a $31 million campaign for non-urgent surgical operations.
An additional 2,600 operations, including orthopaedic surgery and cataract surgery, will help catch up.
Funding is also provided for appointment-free clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better external care, training of medical executives, mental health services and deployment of electronic medical record systems in local hospitals.
“These investments respond to the idea that, according to front-line clinicians, this is the best way to treat Tasmania’s health system,” Plibersek said.
The minister said the Tasmanian government would face a strict reporting and accountability regime.
The state will need to maintain current levels of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where it spends the additional funds.
A three-person commission will be formed to ensure that the State provides services in the most efficient and efficient manner possible.
Mr Wilkie said today that the $325 million will not count for much “unless they are followed by a genuine reform to consolidate Tasmania’s public health system.”
However, he congratulated the government for responding to the urgent request for assistance that he presented to the Prime Minister in early May.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will make a significant contribution to removing Tasmania's public health system from the blacklist," Wilkie said.
According to the state government, these additional non-urgent procedures will largely reverse recent cuts.
But opposition health spokesman Peter Dutton believes today’s announcement is a “fortunate solution.”
“The reason we’re here is that the state’s Labor government has withdrawn $430 million from its health care system,” he told ABC TV.
One cannot have a state government that pulls out almost half a billion dollars and the Commonwealth that puts in $300 million, and claim it's a day of glory.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Plibersek to ensure that no dollars from the rescue plan would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of Denis Diderot's novel boasts remarkable artistic direction and a meticulous period reconstruction, but it is also more laborious than it should be.
Set in 1760s France, it tells the dark story of Suzanne, a young aristocrat sent to a convent by her family.
When she rebels, she faces the boundless cruelty of a deliberately sadistic Mother Superior and becomes an object of erotic fascination for another.
The film never spills into luminosity or sensationalism, and that’s the problem.
The conscientious solemnity of the narration could also become a penance for the public.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, says monitoring body
Syria has destroyed equipment essential to the production of chemical weapons and munitions filled with toxic gas, the international chemical weapons watchdog said on Thursday, as violent clashes raged in the north of the country, near one of the sites where toxic agents are supposed to be stored.
A group of Syrian activists also said Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war in the country nearly three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day in advance of the deadline for
On 1 November, the Hague-based organization ordered Damascus to destroy or “make unusable” all chemical weapons production units and machinery for mixing toxic gases and filling ammunition.
The completion of what is essentially the initial phase of destruction is an important step in the ambitious timetable for destroying the chemical weapons of Damascus by mid-2014.
Thanks to the destruction of the equipment, Syria will no longer be able to produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus still has to start the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
It is believed that the country has about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came as fighting raged on Thursday in the town of Safira, which experts say is home to a chemical weapons production unit as well as storage sites, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported.
The militant group, which tracks the evolution of the human balance sheet through a network of militants based in Syria, said Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Among them, it is estimated that there were 61,067 civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, it is estimated that 29,954 members of President Bashar al-Assad’s armed forces were killed, including 18,678 pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militants.
Among the dead, an estimated 2,202 were deserters and some 5,375 opposition fighters, many of whom were foreigners.
On 25 July, the United Nations estimated that 100,000 people had died in the conflict since March 2011.
She hasn't updated that number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee the country because of the conflict.
Assad’s troops have been fighting rebels, many of whom have been linked to groups in the al-Qaeda network in Safira for weeks.
The Observatory said Thursday that there were losses on both sides, but did not give any precision.
The fighting underscored the importance of the dangers faced by chemical weapons inspectors as they must complete their mission, which is to rid Syria of its toxic arsenal in the midst of an ongoing civil war, within tight deadlines.
A statement from the OPCW, which works closely with the UN, said its team was “now satisfied to have controlled – and seen destroyed – all of the declared critical production and machinery for mixing and filling.”
She added that "no other inspection activities are planned at this time."
Earlier this week, inspectors said they had completed the first stage of the audit work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites reported by Damascus.
They were unable to visit the last two sites due to safety concerns, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPCW said the two sites were, according to Syria, “abandoned and ... that elements of the chemical weapons program they contained had been moved to other reported sites, which have been inspected.”
It was difficult to know at first glance whether the Safira unit was one of two sites that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria submitted a plan for the total destruction of its chemical weapons, which was approved the following month by the OPCW Executive Committee.
“I commend the moral strength and courage that you have all shown in the most difficult mission ever undertaken by this organization,” said Director General Ahmet Uzumcu, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
Now in its third year, the civil war mainly pits Sunni Muslim rebels against the Assad government and its security forces, which are backed by members of the Alawite sect, a branch of Shiite Islam.
On the other hand, the director of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said that there had been a strong explosion Wednesday at an air defense base in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion remains unknown, he added.
Anger caused by the sentencing of one of the Bali bombers
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people killed in the 2002 Bali bombings reacted with anger to the sentence handed down against the last of the conspirators to be brought to justice, saying Umar Patek should be shot by an execution squad.
Patek, who has spent nearly 10 years on the run as one of Southeast Asia's most wanted men, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in manufacturing the explosive devices used in the attacks.
He could be released after 15 years under parole.
The 45-year-old man was found guilty of mass murder for the attacks on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many.
He was also found guilty of many other terrorism-related charges, including a wave of attacks targeting churches across Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
Prosecutors have asked for a life sentence, but they could have asked for the man, described as "Demolition Man" for his reputation as a bomb-making expert, to be sentenced to death.
The decision rekindled painful memories for June Corteen, a Perth mother who lost her two 39-year-old twins, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators nearly 10 years ago.
On the verge of tears, she said Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should have followed the same path as the other men.
“He should be dragged in front of the execution squad,” Ms. Corteen told the AAP.
I have to live every day without having other grandchildren or seeing my daughters.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, loaded into a van parked outside, exploded just after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar when a suicide bomber blew up a bag full of explosives just 20 seconds earlier.
He fell into a coma the day after the attack and remained unconscious for a month, and he "died" three times while on respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues said Patek should have known the same fate as the three other members of the Jemaah Islamiyah terror cell responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were executed four years ago.
In reality, this man should have been sentenced to death before the others.
To keep him alive, why, there's no reason to keep him alive.
Spending 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds of others is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to be brought to justice.
He had managed to avoid capture for nearly 10 years but was eventually arrested in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where U.S. forces will kill former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden less than four months later.
During the trial, an FBI agent said intelligence reports had revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of re-establishing ties between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaeda.
“He didn’t give up,” added Ms. Corteen.
Until recently, he used to laugh about the grief he could have caused other people.
The verdict was delivered on the eve of the 10th anniversary of the attacks, which will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonies in Bali and Australia.
“There will be a lot of crying this year,” said Ms. Corteen.
Patek, however, can appeal his conviction.
FAA: Air passengers can now use gadgets on planes (but not make a call with their cell phone)
Airline passengers will be able to use their electronic devices door-to-door to read, work, play games, watch movies and listen to music — but not talk on their mobile phones — under the highly anticipated new guidelines released Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be implemented will vary from airline to airline, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said at a news conference.
Airlines will have to prove to the FAA that their aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the crew training manuals and rules regarding the storage of aircraft to be compliant.
The FAA said it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue are among the companies that have already submitted plans.
“Based on the plan, we could approve expanded use of electronic devices very soon,” the FAA said in a statement.
Currently, passengers must turn off their smartphones, tablets and other devices as soon as the aircraft doors are closed.
They are not supposed to light them again until the plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet and the commander gives his green light.
Passengers are supposed to switch off their aircraft when the plane is descending before landing and not relight them until the plane has landed.
Under the new guidelines, airlines whose aircraft are properly protected from electronic interference will be able to allow passengers to use their aircraft during take-offs, landings and ground operations, the FAA said.
Most of the new airliners and other aircraft that have been modified so that passengers can use Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, president of the Association of Professional Flight Attendants, said she was happy with the changes.
“Once the new policy is safely implemented – and we will work closely with carriers to do so – it will be beneficial to everyone,” Glading said in a statement.
We are frankly tired of feeling like “room supervisors” when it comes to this issue.
But it will still be forbidden to connect to the Internet to surf, exchange emails and SMS or download data below 10,000 feet, the agency said.
Passengers will have to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices in airplane mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-style online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was blasted out of an American Airlines plane after refusing to turn off his device while the device was parked at the door.
And heavier devices like laptops will always have to be stowed away because they could hurt someone if they flew through the cabin.
Mobile phones on board will also continue to be banned.
The regulatory power over mobile phones belongs to the Federal Communications Commission and not to the FAA.
The FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic devices during take-off and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national transportation safety expert on CBS News, said mobile phones were still considered risky.
“Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially create interference with navigational instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could disrupt mobile phone relay antennas if they are used on board,” Rosenker said.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to look into the issue recommended last month that the government allow wider use of personal electronic devices.
The pressure on the FAA has increased in recent years to ease restrictions on its use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, M.D., argue that there is no valid security reason for these bans.
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies indicate that at least one-third of passengers forget to turn off their devices, or do so deliberately.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices in 1996 following reports of interference with navigation and communication instruments when passengers were carrying FM radios, the high-tech gadget of the time.
The new airliners depend much more on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to withstand electronic interference and approved by the FAA.
Airlines have been allowing their passengers to use Wi-Fi at cruise altitudes for several years.
Aircraft modified to accommodate Wi-Fi systems are also more resistant to interference.
The vast majority of airliners are expected to allow wider use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit radio transmissions of much lower power than previous generations of devices.
E-book readers, for example, only emit minimal transmissions when turning a page.
But the transmissions are stronger when the devices download or send data.
Amazon.com is among those pushing for a relaxation of restrictions on the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company’s executives loaded a line plane of Kindle e-book readers and flew it to see if there were any problems, but there were none.
This inspired members of the FAA's advisory committee to have mixed feelings about whether or not the use of the devices presents a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he thought the interference from the aircraft was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there are only anecdotal reports from pilots that the aircraft may interfere with an aircraft's systems, and that most of them are very old.
However, the committee recommended that the FAA authorize pilots to ask passengers to switch off their aircraft during instrument landings under low visibility conditions.
A travel industry group welcomed the changes, calling them common-sense arrangements for tech-savvy travelers.
“We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with safety,” said Roger Dow, President and CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
A helipaded bird from a platform in the North Sea has been released into the wild
A bird, helicoptered after being found exhausted on an oil rig in the North Sea, has been released into the wild.
The water slide was mounted on a helicopter heading for Aberdeen last month before it was put back up by the Scottish SPCA at its Alloa Rescue Centre.
The center’s director, Colin Seddon, said: “This water slide was probably a wintering migrant coming from northern Europe and found himself caught in the middle of violent winds in the North Sea.”
It seems that the exhausted bird would have managed to find refuge on the oil platform.
He added: “He was unable to fly again, so we were contacted to help.”
The water grate was healthy when it was released.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise to bring businesses together and define what wealth and job creators want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of UK business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, businesses and the EU.
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders, globally representative of all business sizes, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will come as a surprise to many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now looking to export outside Europe, focusing on countries that are modernising and developing while EU states are stagnating.
They want the government to give priority to new trade ties with countries like China, India and Brazil rather than get entangled in the long and arduous process of reforming European institutional arcana.
When asked for their opinion on specific policy issues – ranging from the regulation of monopolies to product laws – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key skills should be returned to Westminster.
The single market has caused widespread discontent, with companies saying that the cost of the Brussels Regulation is disproportionate to the benefits of being part of the European trading zone – 40% of large companies, traditionally the most pro-European, even agree.
Finally, and more importantly, our survey of business leaders revealed that a large majority wanted Britain to pursue initiatives in favour of a treaty change and the development of a relationship with the EU based on trade rather than politics.
This conclusion, which is found in all major groups and companies of all sizes, shows that the corporate world is insisting on a “significant change” that restores power to the UK.
The stakes are high – achieving a change in the treaty and better representing Britain’s interests would see a 16% drop in votes in favour of keeping the country in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should not hesitate for a moment: this survey shows that British companies support this plan aimed at renegotiating the terms of Britain's accession to the EU.
It also shows that companies hope that the renegotiation will constitute a significant change in the current balance of power in favour of a return to the UK.
It is possible, and increasingly necessary, to better represent the interests of British businesses, as the euro area commits itself to a closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be employment and growth in Britain and, as the findings of our survey show, for businesses this means refocusing on trade and a fundamental change in the regulatory approach to Brussels.
The United States in the colors of Halloween
In the United States, President Obama did not derogate from the Halloween tradition.
With his wife, last night, he handed out treats to hundreds of children invited to the White House gardens in Washington.
Last year, Halloween festivities on the east coast of the United States were canceled due to the passage of Hurricane Sandy.
This year, the festivities have caught up.
In New York, thousands of costumed people participated in the parade organized in the neighborhood of "Greenwich village".
Everyone is over-excited, says one of the participants, Andrea.
I was finally able to put on the costume I had planned for last year.
We have fun like crazy, adds Rhonda.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, he's cool.
We really need this.
Halloween is a pagan holiday celebrated on the eve of All Saints' Day, mainly in Anglo-Saxon countries.
Gazprom’s Alexei Miller says Bulgaria’s gas pipeline ushers in a new era of gas
The start of construction of the South Stream gas pipeline in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of Europe’s largest energy projects, Gazprom’s director said.
“A historic event took place today: Construction began in the Bulgarian part of the South Stream gas pipeline, Europe’s largest large-scale project,” Alexei Miller, Gazprom’s managing director, said in a statement on Thursday.
This project is a key element of the energy security of the entire European continent.
South Stream is expected to diversify Russia’s export routes to Europe.
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine, through which most of the Russian gas destined for Europe passes, increases the level of risk compared to conventional routes, the director adds.
Miller added that the direct connection to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are eliminated “forever”.
Bulgarian consumers will receive South Stream gas at a reduced rate as soon as the entire project is put into operation in 2015.
Gazprom said construction is expected to start in other downstream countries by the end of the year.
The pipeline was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion cubic meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the world’s largest marine reserve
Pitcairn Island wants to create the world's largest marine reserve, the daily newspaper Les Nouvelles de Tahiti announced on Thursday, resuming information from Radio Australia.
This island, east of the Gambier Archipelago (French Polynesia), is the last British territory in the South Pacific, halfway between New Zealand and Chile.
This territory measures 47 km2, if there are three other small islands nearby.
He has been British since his occupation in 1790 by the Bounty Mutins, an episode in the history of the English Navy that gave rise to three Hollywood adaptations.
A few dozen inhabitants, mostly descendants of the Bounty mutineers, still live in Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95% of London's generosity.
The Council of the Island voted unanimously in favour of the creation of a marine reserve around the small archipelago, 836,000 km2 corresponding to its exclusive economic zone.
An assistant mayor of the island went to London to ask Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, the mayor of Pitcairn, believes that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards more financial autonomy for his island.
The project must be accepted by the English governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British government.
The creation of such a marine reserve would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836,000 km2, provided, however, that it has the means to ensure its monitoring, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more aircraft dedicated to monitoring the area, and there is no port where military surveillance ships can be placed.
As for France, it already has to conduct the very expensive air and maritime surveillance of the five million km2 of the French Polynesia EEZ, neighboring Pitcairn.

Life in prison for a former Chinese vice-governor
A former deputy governor of Jilin province in northeastern China was sentenced Friday to life in prison for corruption.
Expelled from the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having touched more than 19 million yuan of bribes, Chinese official media reported.
Between 1995 and 2001, the deputy governor, who was also the president of Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped companies and officials obtain contracts, loans or promotions in exchange for money or gifts, Beijing's first intermediate court said on its microblog.
President Xi Jinping, who took office last March, has made the fight against corruption a national priority, considering the phenomenon a threat to the very existence of the Communist Party.
If the head of state promised that justice would be as inadmissible with the powerful "tigers" as with the "flies" - the subordinate officials - only a handful of high-ranking officials were convicted, among them former executives of the oil giant Petrochina.
The most spectacular recent case was that of the former CCP leader in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, sentenced to life in September for corruption and abuse of power after targeting the highest offices within the state.
But the government has in no way expressed its intention to reform the anti-corruption system by creating, for example, a party-independent body.
Two YMCA employees charged with sexual assault following allegations made against Jonathan Lord at a Royal Commission hearing.
Two employees of the YMCA in New South Wales have been charged with sexual assaults against children following allegations made against Caringbah educator Jonathan Lord in 2011 at a Royal Commission on Child Sexual Abuse hearing.
But in its opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA said it had “never had to deal with a problem of sexual assault on children within its organization.”
Director General Phillip Hare was questioned on two cases: a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and a physical education monitor at YMCA Caringbah Hall was found guilty of sexual assault on children in the center where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare told Gail Furness, counsel for the Commission, that he had been aware of the first case but was not aware of the second.
He also admitted that the YMCA’s opening statement was inaccurate by pointing out, “External YMCA checks were conducted and indicated that child safety was an absolute priority for the organization.”
It was demonstrated before the Commission that the YMCA had been informed that it had received the second worst ratings on four institutions in a Department of Education and Communities quality audit conducted in August of this year.
Mr. Hare, who began working at the YMCA at the age of 21, admitted that staff management was a failure with Lord's recruitment and that he had failed to verify that employees knew they were required to report any violations of the child safety policy.
Earlier in the year, Lord was convicted of sexual assault on twelve boys during the two years he worked at the YMCA.
He was sentenced to a minimum of six years in prison.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing staff from reporting Lord's failings in child safety.
Staff members testified that they had noticed some shortcomings, including the fact that Lord was alone with the children, kept them in private, made them sit on his knees, told them that he loved them, and let them play with his mobile phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was supervised by Lord and had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about her behavior, said she found YMCA Caringbah’s child services manager, Jacqui Barnat, to be in charge of Lord’s “very intimidating and difficult to approach most of the time.”
The Director-General said he was dismissing staff testimony that they were reluctant to report these breaches to their senior management.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they had with Lord had blurred their judgment, which meant that they did not report his actions.
Mr. Hare stated that he had expressed his views to the New South Wales YMCA Council saying that, for the organization, the lesson learned from the "Jonathan Lord incident" should not be about "reporting" by staff, and the Council agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to have privacy agreements signed by staff shortly after the allegations were raised was made by YMCA’s Director General for Child Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any contamination of the evidence but that it was an "excess of zeal" and that it had been poorly implemented.
The New South Wales YMCA was not a safe organization for children at the time Jonathan Lord was employed there, namely between 2009 and 2011, said the expert on sexual violence against children, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University before the Commission.
He said there were "serious problems" in recruiting, controlling, initiating, training and supervising staff.
The hearing was adjourned until December 20.
Tony Blair has said he will seize the opportunity to become Prime Minister again, but acknowledges that his return is unlikely.
In an interview last night marking the 5th anniversary of his departure at the end of his term, the 59-year-old made his views known on various national policies.
Since leaving in June 2007 after a decade at the helm of the country, Mr Blair has largely avoided discussing British politics, limiting his comments to foreign affairs and his role as the Quartet's special envoy for the Middle East peace process.
When asked if he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister, Mr Blair would have replied, according to the London Evening Standard: “Yes, of course, but it can probably happen, so...”
When many experts in equestrian events gathered in Cardiff to compete and win the Horse of the Year trophy, they knew the competition would be tough.
But no one expected to see Fenton Kirkland win, a three-year-old child.
Not yet in school and only a few months after making his first weapons, the toddler and his pony Shetland Toffee trod during the three towers with great ease and won the first prize, leaving behind them the other 30 adult competitors.
The two inseparable – who are the same size – were hailed for presentation, attitude and style at the annual competition held at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
Presenting himself against men and women in elegant melon hats, he wore his flat hat a little on the side casually to parade his 2-year-old pony Toffee around the track.
Fenton was praised by the judges for his unusual natural training qualities for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good marks for his presentation and personality.
Fenton got Toffee as a gift for his 3rd birthday last March and has been training with his pony Shetland every day since.
His mother Donna, 30, said: “Fenton and Toffee make an excellent duo.”
They presented themselves to and against everyone, but both blew up the golden cup and the rosette.
It was only the second time he was competing with Toffee and we were thrilled that he won.
On the track, people who didn't know him thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been participating in equestrian competitions for more than 10 years.
Ms Howells said: “There was electricity in the air and everyone was cheering and applauding it.”
He ran the entire length of the track and even though he seemed to be quite small, he did a wonderful job.
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses, tractors and the rural world and has two chickens he takes care of.
From the way he started, he’ll surely be participating in the Horse of the Year event soon – and I’m sure he’ll do a great job.
A spokesman for the annual equestrian event said: “Fenton is only 3 years old but he knows how to drive his pony.”
They make a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee performed well and how they performed on the track.
They are looking for effective teamwork between the pony and the trainer – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really proud.
A Chinese newspaper that launched a call “will be revamped”
A Chinese newspaper that launched a front-page appeal for the release of a journalist accused of defamation is going to be revamped, a press regulator says.
The Guangzhou-based New Express issued a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Mr. Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to make up stories about a semi-public company.
Now, the New Express will undergo a “complete overhaul,” the regulator said.
The order of "redesign" emanates from the Guangdong administration for Press and Publishing, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News group, had published several erroneous articles about the company listed on Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The writing of New Express was disorganized,” the regulator said in a statement.
He said he had decided “to impose an administrative sanction on Chen Yongzhou by removing his press card.”
He also “ordered the Yangcheng Evening News Group to undertake a complete overhaul of New Express, and recommended that it conduct an investigation into the persons responsible at New Express and immediately re-emergency the newspaper’s management team.”
Chen has written several articles for the New Express about alleged financial irregularities of a construction equipment manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper twice issued a front-page appeal for his release, writing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen later appeared on a public television channel where he admitted to having published false stories for money.
“In this case, I have harmed Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public trust,” he told public television network CCTV.
I did it mainly because I was running after money and fame.
I realized my mistake.
Following Mr. Chen's apology, New Express posted his apology on the front page, writing that he had not properly checked his articles.
Several important suspects have recently made televised confessions.
Experts say that people are systematically forced to make their confessions, despite a change in the law that was voted earlier in the year prohibiting authorities from forcing anyone to incriminate themselves.
The aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle in "unavailability"
In Toulon, the aircraft carrier is in a row.
The leak of radioactive steam detected at one of Charles de Gaulle's two nuclear boilers in mid-October and while the ship was at sea, was "safe for sailors", but not without consequences for the Navy.
The Royal has confirmed to us the "unavailability" of the ship until "mid-November", "the time to take the necessary corrective measures" on the reactor.
For its part, the company DCNS, a specialist in the naval defense, ensures that its teams and those of Areva, dispatched to the Var for the occasion, "currently intervene on the aircraft carrier".
It is for them, among other things, to change a pump on the faulty boiler.
“Everything is being implemented so that Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013,” DCNS explains.
And the National Navy to certify that "it does not question the program of activity of the ship" nuclear propulsion.
Recall that the aircraft carrier Charles-de-Gaulle comes out of an intermediate maintenance period of six months.
He had flown from Toulon in mid-October for a training.
This, in particular, with a view to qualifying young fighter pilots.
A "small breakdown", confined to the containment space of the reactor, had then occurred on the admiral ship of the French fleet.
According to the Navy, the crew had not been exposed to any radioactive contamination.
For more than a year, everywhere, I have been able to see a great discontent on the part of the people I meet: monstrous revaluation of their properties, flood of taxes, cost of permits of all kinds, administrative costs not to end.
In short, unlimited siphoning of our pockets.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be saved in order to allow a very respectful taxation of those who pay.
Any money taken from taxpayers by force diminishes their freedom of consumption and contributes to their impoverishment.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major companies, there is no problem with lavish spending and the maintenance of lame ducks: a deficit cultural center, a strong subsidy to the City of Energy, etc.
If these facilities are not profitable, sell them to the private company or demolish them.
It is also difficult to see the expropriation of several properties in order to welcome a major industry that has never come.
I give an honorable mention, however, to the transformation of the old Wabasso into a kind of industrial incubator, but at what cost to taxpayers?
It is not at the public level to invest in such companies, but rather in the private sector based on consumer demand.
Citizens were pleased to learn that fishing lakes and pools will continue to supply the city with drinking water.
As a result of the departure of all industries (large water users) and the large population decline, water use has decreased significantly throughout the territory.
Without meaning to waste it, the city will never run out of water and strict regulations regarding its use could be greatly softened.
In short, it is very easy to achieve great things with the money of others.
I would be ashamed to defend such a balance sheet.
With a gross debt of more than $200 million, this city is no longer even able to buy a pen without going through a loan settlement.
We’ve been run for over 40 years by ties with beautiful degrees for the most part and I don’t think a sheep farmer does worse.
The discovery of a drug tunnel between the United States and Mexico with its own railway
One of the most sophisticated tunnels serving for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, having its own lighting, ventilation and electrical rail systems, has been discovered.
U.S. officials have described the 4-foot-by-3 tunnel as one of the most sophisticated secret passageways they have ever seen.
The tunnel, zigzag on an equivalent length to nearly six football fields long, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, to San Diego, USA.
The area is full of indefinable warehouses, which makes it easy to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before the drugs were recovered by going unnoticed, authorities said.
Authorities seized 8.5 tons of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the tunnel was discovered, according to court records.
Three men who, according to authorities, worked as drivers, were charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine with intent to sell.
They are sentenced to 10 years in prison if they are sentenced to life imprisonment.
In Nogales, Arizona, traffickers operate vast underground drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered following the marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, posing a challenge for drug cartels that must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, authorities found a passageway of about 700 yards equipped with railroad tracks that left the kitchen of a Tijuana house and went up to two warehouses in San Diego.
British Police Issue Extradition Order Against Assange <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
British police today issued an extradition warrant against WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and sought political asylum.
Scotland Yard said it had issued a “notice of surrender” against the 40-year-old Australian, asking him to report to a police station, adding that if he did not, he would be likely to be arrested.
Assange could be extradited to Sweden following allegations of sex crime, after exhausting all possible avenues under British law after the Supreme Court invalidated his appeal against his extradition earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would allow his transfer to the United States, he took refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on June 19, asking the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard has “issued a surrender notice against a 40-year-old man who asks him to appear at a police station, on the date and time of his choice,” a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail.
The Embassy declined to comment on the issuance of the notice by the police.
Assange fears being extradited from Sweden to the United States where he could be accused of spying, after revealing more than 250,000 US diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website fighting secret information.
How Biometrics Will Invade Our Lives
Finished the passwords to type to access his smartphone or pay for his purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers are predicting a future where we will be recognized by the biometric sensors of phones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Morpho’s deputy general manager, even believes that “the century will be biometric.”
Only biometrics will ensure the identity of a person carrying out transactions in a world as transversal and transnational as the Internet.
Organizations dedicated to the protection of privacy confirm this enthusiasm for biometrics, but are concerned about it.
In 2011 and in France alone, the Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés authorized 774 systems for the recognition of fingerprints, the shape of the hand or the venous network of the hand in companies, administrations, canteens...
“Everyone will soon be able to be identified, anywhere and anytime,” said Justin Brookman, head of consumer privacy at the Center for Democracy and Technology (CDT) in Washington.
The reasons for such optimism in some, and pessimism in others?
Biometrics will be based on new techniques, which will enable new services to citizens and consumers.
Today, in France, the most commonly used biometric data are fingerprints, the outline of the hand and the venous network of the palm or fingers.
But each of these techniques has its limitations.
“For example, some people who work with concrete have very damaged fingers and their fingerprints are unreadable,” said Philippe Robin, Technical Director of Identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the collection as well as the verification of the venous network and the contour of the hand presuppose a voluntary and precise gesture of the people.
This is both a security - it is not possible to capture this data without their knowledge - and a disadvantage: the procedure sometimes needs to be repeated and therefore takes time.
As a result, research has been conducted for about twenty years on other approaches, such as facial or iris recognition (the colored part of the eye).
By increasing the accuracy of sensors and the computing capacity of computers required for data analysis, these techniques become operational.
The accuracy of facial recognition has increased tenfold over the past five years, according to Cyrille Bataller, director of Accenture’s R&D laboratories in Europe.
With our help, the United Kingdom and Holland have deployed automatic border crossings using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a moving face or iris.
“Today, we’re conducting research on voice recognition or how to walk using sound sensors, but we need a quiet environment,” said Sridhar Iyengar, director of security research at Intel Labs.
A unique and unfalsifiable marker, DNA also raises hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it can be considered the ultimate biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Director of Studies, Innovation and Prospects at the CNIL.
But DNA analysis is still very long and very expensive.
NEC offers law enforcement a suitcase costing 90,000 euros to analyze DNA samples at the scene of a crime and within an hour.
The uses of biometrics are divided into two groups: identification (recognizing a person among others) and authentication (ensuring that the person is who they claim to be).
The identification has so far concerned the issue of identity documents: it is necessary to compare the biometric elements (fingerprints, photo, iris) with the information that the state has on all citizens already registered.
This ensures that a person is not trying to usurp someone else's identity.
This principle of comparison may have other applications.
NEC offers VIP recognition at the entrance of a hotel or a store.
“We retrieve images from surveillance cameras and compare them to photos of celebrities who move freely on the Internet,” says Dany Nassif, NEC France’s commercial development manager for biometric identification solutions.
Another use: take a picture of a quidam that queues in a store, track its progress through facial recognition and calculate the waiting time.
Authentication initially concerned physical access (borders, protected premises, canteens...) or logical access (opening a computer).
More recently, the presence control has been added.
"A biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the boyfriend pointing for another," explains Cyrille Bataller, of Accenture.
But, increasingly, authentication will also concern transactions, especially those made from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan, it is already possible to withdraw money from some distributors by introducing his card and placing his hand on a biometric reader: this gesture replaces the hit of the secret code.
A similar technique is tested in Villeneuve-d'Ascq and in Angoul<0xC3><0xAA>me by the company Natural Security in partnership with banks and brands of the large distribution: when paying in store with his credit card, the customer does not type his code, but inserts his finger into a reader that scans the veins.
The experiment is expected to last six months.
If it is conclusive, biometric readers could soon arrive at French merchants.
Tips for Reassuring Users
There are three ways to make biometrics appealing to the general public.
The first is to explain that it can save time.
“If, thanks to the biometrics, a customer stays in checkout thirty seconds less, it is appreciable,” explains the director of a large area.
The second is to offer personalized services: in a few years, a voice server will be able to recognize your voice and offer you tailor-made options.
And, finally, reassure by highlighting the precautions taken to protect databases.
“The fingerprints are stored on a first server; the identities of the people are in a second base: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure box, which is blocked if you try to move it,” said Philippe Robin of Thales.
But, due to the lack of in-depth studies, it is impossible to know if these speeches really convince users.
Privacy experts, for example, continue to be concerned.
“The advances in facial recognition, the proliferation of surveillance cameras, and the huge amount of photos available on Facebook, Flickr, or Picasa, scare me the worst: widespread surveillance,” said Andrew Patrick of the Office of the Privacy Commissioner in Canada.
A driver driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink between his legs was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000
A motorist was fined <0xC2><0xA3>1,000 for driving at 210 km/h with a hot drink balanced between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was spotted driving his Mercedes Benz on the A120 at Braintree on May 27.
When the police arrested him, they discovered the drink to take between his legs.
At the Colchester Court of First Instance, Howie admitted the offence of conduct without the caution and attention required.
The seven points removed from his licence led to a 6-month licence withdrawal.
Howie was also sentenced to pay a <0xC2><0xA3>90 fee and a <0xC2><0xA3>100 victim surcharge.
A tax on foreign property owners to blow up the London bubble
The Treasury has provisionally quantified the capital gains tax measure but is awaiting a final decision from Mr. Osborne who, in the 2012 budget, entered a 7% stamp duty for properties costing more than <0xC2><0xA3>2 million and annual fees for buyers who choose to own properties as part of a corporation rather than as an individual.
The stamp duty already applies to residential properties in the boroughs of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents <0xC2><0xA3>708 million for fiscal year 2012/13, which exceeds the total of Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, the North West and the Yorkshire and Humber region.
Mr Cook said: “Following the increase in stamp duty on high-value properties and the introduction of the anti-avoidance law on the matter, it is very difficult to argue that high-value properties are under-taxed regardless of the effects of the obsolete housing tax system.”
“But this change could make foreign investors reluctant to buy properties in London or current owners reluctant to sell,” he added.
Prestigious real estate – the 5 to 10 per cent of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the thriving south-west London sector stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, rose by a record 11.8% over the past year.
Prices in central London show steady year-on-year growth of 5.6% but have been overshadowed by a growing "internal market", with the city's south-west, north (7.4%) and east (6.5%) experiencing a recovery, according to Savills's studies.
Scientists have just highlighted how a dog’s tail movements are related to its mood.
Previous studies had found that happy dogs moved their tail more to the right (from the dog’s point of view), while nervous dogs moved it more to the left.
But now scientists say dogs can detect and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trento, said: “Everyone knows that in humans, the left side and right side of the brain are involved differently in stimuli that awaken positive or negative emotions.”
Here, we tried to see what it was like in other species.
He added that just as in humans, in dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres played a different role in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs react to the disordered tail movements of other dogs, the researchers followed animals watching movies featuring other dogs.
They measured the animals’ heart rate and analyzed their behavior.
It probably won’t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes goes one way and sometimes the other.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We presented dogs with films featuring other dogs – either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to avoid any other confounding factor – and we were able to traffic the movement of the tail and present it as going more left or right.”
When the animals saw a dog without expression moving its tail to the right (from the point of view of the dog moving its tail), they remained perfectly relaxed.
But when they spotted a tail deflecting mainly to the left (again from the point of view of the dog shaking the tail), their heart rate accelerated and they looked anxious.
Professor Vallortigara said he did not think dogs were deliberately communicating with each other through these movements.
Rather, he thinks that dogs know by experience the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: “If you repeatedly meet other dogs and notice that, most of the time, the movement of their tails to one side is associated with a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads to a less friendly attitude, you will react based on that experience.”
The researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinarians and trainers to better understand the emotions of their animals.
Canine behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting professor at the University of Bristol's School of Veterinary Sciences, said this was not the first study to examine the importance of the left and right in the canine species.
Last year, a team at Lincoln University found that dogs turned their heads to the left when they looked at an aggressive dog and to the right when it was a cheerful dog.
And in another scientific study conducted by the University of Victoria in Canada, he said, “Dogs go more easily to a robot dog when its tail moves to the left rather than to the right, instead of becoming anxious – the opposite of what appears in the Italian study.”
He indicated that the differences may be due to the fact that the dogs that participated in the different studies did not fully consider the animals of the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could be helpful, he explained.
“Although many of the findings in different mammals indicate that both sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details still need to be clarified – and dogs are no exception,” he said.
However, given the ease with which their behaviors can be recorded, it won’t be long before we understand why their tail sometimes moves on one side and sometimes on the other.
Arctic Monkeys postpones concert in Glasgow due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed a concert in Glasgow after its singer was diagnosed with laryngitis.
The Sheffield band was scheduled to perform Friday in the The Hydro concert hall in the city centre.

Pope Francis to appoint first cardinals in February
Pope Francis will appoint new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on February 22, the Vatican announced Thursday.
The cardinals are the highest-ranking churchmen in the Catholic Church behind the pope, and those who elect him, so Francis will name his first group of men who will ultimately choose his successor.
There are currently 201 cardinals.
However, as soon as a cardinal reaches the age of 80, he can no longer participate in the election of a pope – that is, a group of 120 “elector cardinals”.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said a meeting bringing together all the existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony in which bishops will be elevated to the dignity of cardinal, known as consistory.
“Pope Francis has decided to communicate his decision to convene the February Consistory in advance in order to facilitate the planning of other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from different parts of the world,” Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of the Catholic Voices said that by February, the number of cardinal electors will likely have decreased.
He said that a pope generally appoints as many cardinals as he needs so that the number of cardinal electors reaches 120 and as many cardinals over the age of 80 as he wants.
Next year’s Consistory will be important as it will be the first since Pope Francis’ election in March this year, Valero said.
At the moment, there is a kind of tendency to favour Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interesting to see if the new pope appoints cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance,” he added.
40% of Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since Francis formed the council of cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with examining ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided for himself.
“From now on, Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him,” Valero said.
He added that it was "completely possible" that Francis would seek advice from the cardinals.
But we have never experienced such a situation – it is totally new.
Valero said the popes generally raised bishops representing large communities to the rank of cardinal, but that Francis was “full of surprises – so we don’t know who he will name.”
GM Recalls Some of Its New Pickups in the U.S. to Repair Seat Record
General Motors Co recalled nearly 19,000 of its all-new 2014 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups to address a problem with manually tiltable files, according to a statement Friday from the U.S. vehicle safety regulator.
On some pickups, the front seats could be defective in the tilting mechanism.
As a result, the files do not meet federal vehicle safety standards for head restraints.
“If the vehicle is hit from the rear, the head restraint may not properly protect passengers, thus increasing the risk of injury,” according to a statement posted on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website.
The recalled models were built between August 1 and September 10.
The rollout of GM pickups began in June and represents the largest vehicle launch for the first U.S. automaker since its bankruptcy and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed pickup owners of the defect during the first fortnight of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the letter of information to owners due to the 16-day shutdown of government activities, slowing vehicle sales growth in October.
Sales of Silverado and Sierra pickups, which were redesigned for the 2014 model, increased by about 20% in the first 10 months of the year, GM said Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado pickups and 16,503 Sierra pickups.
GM's stock price rose 1.4% to reach $37.47 on the New York Stock Exchange Friday afternoon.
A worker dies buried under concrete blocks.
A construction worker died buried under dozens of concrete blocks Thursday morning in Montreal.
The tragedy occurred around 11 a.m., on rue Marquette, near the intersection of rue Beaubien, in the borough of Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
In all likelihood, work on the foundations had been going on at this location for some time.
A foundation wall had just been erected in the last few days.
The accident occurred when the victim had just arrived at the site to retrieve his tools.
I was driving and I saw the wall collapsing with a big cloud of smoke, said Sylvain Jean, who lives near the construction site.
I landed and went to remove the large bricks that covered it.
We only saw a part of his back, it's so unfortunate.
According to the authorities, the victim is a man in his fifties who worked for a formwork company.
Resuscitation maneuvers were attempted by the emergency services, but without success.
The man did not survive his serious injuries.
An inspector from the Commission on Health and Safety at Work was dispatched to the scene to investigate the circumstances surrounding this tragedy.
The Cry of Despair of an Obama Voter
I voted twice for President Obama, believing in the possibility of change.
He says Obama has made commendable efforts thwarted by Republican Party obstructionism
Obstructionism does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor the drone attacks
Obama’s 2008 campaign memory is a sad reminder of what could have happened
Nathaniel P. Morris is a 2nd year medical student at Harvard Medical School.
I am reading a very sad book these days.
It is a book that I thought would encourage me during the lateness of the 2nd year of medicine and give me hope again.
It’s called “The Audacity to Win” and it’s about the memoirs of Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign.
When I finished the medical records of my patients in the evening and went to bed, this book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and speeches could take your breath away.
The election ended in a landslide victory and newscasters took the time to reflect on the historic nature of the moment.
My comrades wept with joy and my parents kept all the newspapers they found.
A young team of visionaries was advancing toward the White House and the nation was ready for change.
During Obama's transition period before taking office in 2008, he had 82% favorable views.
And then I close the book.
Returning to the present is a difficult awakening, it’s like coming out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these days full of optimism, they are like distant memories, a sad reminder of the opportunities of the past.
The change really happened in the years that followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to do with what I had imagined.
I credit Obama with great accomplishments, from the passage of the Affordable Care Act to the departure of Iraq from our military, to the end of the “neither seen nor known” and the assassination of Osama bin Laden.
In addition, I believe that partisan obstructionism has destroyed too many efforts to advance our nation in the areas of immigration reform, public health care and the closure of Guantanamo, among other things.
But after repeatedly defending the Obama administration from my peers and colleagues, I can no longer provide an explanation.
I am on the verge of political despair.
The Republican obstruction cannot explain the targeting of foreign leaders, nor the attacks of innocent foreign children by drones.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency is collecting data on Americans’ privacy, nor is it blaming whistleblowers who reveal government wrongdoing.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, a U.S. citizen, without trial, nor the evasion of public funding and the overrun of authorized spending during presidential campaigns.
She can’t justify the findings of a report that says the White House’s efforts to silence the media are the “most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration.”
And, more recently, it cannot excuse the impossibility of designing a simple website for more than three years after the Affordable Care Act was ratified.
I don't know if that's what I expected.
If, at 18, I was supposed to understand that governance could contradict the political campaigns that preceded it.
Obviously, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition political party and events that happen by chance, such as the Newton massacre, influence our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have listed above seem to be largely the choice of administration.
That's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, but not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney presented a confusing and unrefined alternative that did not seem to allow for his policies or positions to be determined.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second term by being freed from the pressure of future elections, would keep the promises that we have been hearing about for so long.
Yet, while the favorable opinion index dipped below 45% this week, it is even harder to get back to 2008 through this book.
It makes me wish for the many promises that have flown away.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama suffered huge losses in favor of Clinton in the Pennsylvania primaries.
At a post-campaign meeting, he told his team that they needed to get back on track and stay true to their cause.
“I want us to refocus on our talent,” he said.
We need to remember who we are.
Here we are 5 years later, Mr. President, and I no longer agree with you.
The views expressed in this comment are solely those of Nathaniel Morris.
On Friday, around 3 p.m., a violent collision between a motorcycle and a car occurred on Rue de Retinne in Fléron.
The biker, Jonathan, 26, from Fléron, was not wearing a helmet.
Despite the rapid intervention of the rescuers, he died in this frontal collision.
Clive Palmer claims that MP Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system.
Billionaire MP Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest about the parental leave system because his daughters could be pregnant and take advantage of this system.
The mining tycoon, who is contesting the payment of a $6 million carbon tax, has argued this argument in an attempt to rule out questions about a potential conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate, which could be crucial when deciding whether carbon and mining taxes should be abolished.
But Mr. Palmer claimed that only ministers could have a conflict of interest and indicated that Mr. Abbott's daughters were ready to personally benefit from these policies.
“He will have a major conflict of interest when it comes to paying parental leave because if one of his daughters is pregnant, he will have a direct interest in whether or not she gets a leave,” Palmer said.
Two months after his election, the electoral commission officially declared that Mr. Palmer won the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax by 53 votes, after recounting.
Mr. Palmer put forward the idea of reshaping the suffrage system to speed up the process.
The daughters of Tony Abbott, Frances and Bridget.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is over?
“We need a better system,” he said.
Why couldn’t we have a system you can get into, enter your coordinates into a computer, vote immediately, and have the result at 6:30 the next morning?
Palmer also criticized the use of paper pencils to mark ballots.
Is it to be able to erase the result if someone disagrees?
Nowadays, having a paper pencil seems extraordinary.
The Electoral Commission has considered possible options with regard to electronic voting and has recently published a joint reflection paper with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his political project included an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new duties “very seriously.”
Public service is a matter of public service.
“We’re not looking for a reward, except for the reward of history because we have to serve the community at a critical time,” he added.
A team of biologists led by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of humpback dolphin off Australia’s northern coast.
Thibaut Bouveroux, in charge of scientific mission at the Observatory for the Conservation and Study of Animals and Marine Environments (OCEAMM) returns to L'Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identifying new species.
Are you surprised by the discovery of this new species of humpback dolphin?
This is good news, but I am not particularly surprised.
If in the past, species have been described and identified on a morphological, anatomical and geographical basis, today, the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge in the science of species classification.
Moreover, it is not impossible that these advances in genetics and molecular biology call into question the classification or membership of a species to a genus, a family, or even an order.
In the early 19th century, morphologists classified animals, based on morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these rankings are being challenged because of advances in genetics.
In the same way, two very close morphological species have been distinguished by genetics.
This is the case with the new species that has just been identified.
About ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species belonging to this subfamily: the humpback dolphins of the Pacific and humpback whales of the Atlantic.
Recent analyses have distinguished four species.
Why is this an important discovery, as claimed by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
From a conservation point of view, it is essential to know these genetic differences, in order to protect the species and therefore its genetic variability.
If this population had been known for a long time by researchers, they did not know that it was part of a new species, present only in this place.
Therefore, if a problem of mass mortality caused by a viral epidemic or accidental capture arises in the region, we could be dealing with the extinction of a species, rather than a local disappearance of a population of a more widespread species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or endangered based on the number of individuals existing on Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility that it has to recover from neighbouring stocks.
With respect to the species Sousa chinensis, from which the population of the newly discovered species is derived, its stock has automatically become weaker, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammals?
Marine mammals are located at the top of the food chain.
They live in homogeneous, open habitats, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This mixing of genes limits the creation of new species.
Conversely, more closed ecosystems promote genetic isolation, which can eventually lead to the creation of new species.
It should be noted that the marine environment is the least well-known environment.
It is preferable to send robots to Mars, than to know what lives in the Mariana Trench, only 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
More money is spent on the search for life on other planets than on marine research, and it is high time that this changed.
RBS suspends two traders in the foreign exchange market
Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange market division according to two sources close to the case, which shows once again that the global investigation of regulators on suspicions of currency market manipulation is beginning to bear fruit.
Some of the world’s largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, have confirmed that they are cooperating with regulators as part of investigations into the world’s largest financial market, where $5.3 trillion is changing hands every day.
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended as part of the expansion of the investigation that echoes the scandal of manipulations of the Libor interbank rate.
The bank, which declined to comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from regulators.
“The ongoing investigation into this case is ongoing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators,” a bank representative said two weeks ago.
Last month, sources close to the case said RBS had transmitted files of emails and instant messages, sent to and by a former trader, to the UK regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, left RBS in 2010 and was reportedly suspended from his position as European Cash Trading Manager for currencies at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Citi’s European head of cash forex trading, was laid off this week, while Matt Gardiner, senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
None of these traders have been charged with any wrongdoing.
Usher’s file included instant messages sent to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, sources close to the file added.
UBS said this week that it had filed a lawsuit against some of its employees after Swiss regulator Finma said it was investigating suspicions of currency market manipulation in a number of Swiss banks.
Around the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, the FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are examining allegations made about bankers who allegedly agreed to manipulate rates in the foreign exchange market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from regulators, sources close to the case said.
Banks are scrutinizing instant messages and emails sent over the years to find cases of wrongdoing.
News of these investigations have rocked traders in a sector that has been one of the biggest growth drivers of investment bank trading units in recent years, but which has been called into question this year due to low currency volatility that limits opportunities for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to downplay the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast highly liquid foreign exchange market, but senior traders explain that this is not necessarily true.
A senior trader said that despite the high volume of daily foreign exchange transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange management platforms and the increasingly frequent use by banks of their own internal platforms “explains that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at little cost.”
The news came on the same day that Credit Suisse announced it had sent back a trader working in its London Stock Exchange trading office this week after it caused a $6 million loss at the end of last year.
The bank quickly informed the relevant authorities and cooperated with regulators.
“We are convinced that the trader acted alone and that the matter was handled,” a Crédit Suisse representative said.
The investigation of Mayor Rob Ford has been scrapped, says a lawyer
After police confirmed they had gotten hold of a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoking crack, Mr. Clayton Ruby claimed he had never seen an investigation "so messy".
Ruby told The Canadian Press that police had “ignored or minimized” the evidence against the mayor.
On Thursday, police arrested the 35-year-old friend and occasional driver of Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, and charged him with extortion in connection with the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in frequent contact with the mayor.
Police said they also observed this man delivering packages to Rob Ford, new court documents indicate.
Ruby called it "inexplicable" that police never searched Rob Ford's vehicle or his home, or tapped his phone, arguing that Chief of Police Bill Blair knowingly chose not to act against the mayor.
Under the law, police, having witnessed suspicious transactions in their own hands, could very well have intercepted Rob Ford's vehicle, arrested the mayor, and conducted a search - even without a warrant.
It could also have requested an instant search warrant, if deemed necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his spokesman Mark Pugash called Mr Ruby’s remarks an “obvious and desperate attempt” to bring himself to the media in a case that does not concern him at all.
At a news conference on Thursday, Mr Blair said there was nothing in the video that could constitute "reasonable grounds" that could lead to the filing of a criminal charge against the mayor.
European Stock Exchanges Fall in Mid-Sep, Except for London
With the exception of London, the main European Stock Exchanges are moving downward on Friday in mid-session, lead by some disappointing company news, while Wall-Street is expected to rise.
In addition, investors remain cautious as they believe the U.S. Federal Reserve could untie its quantitative easing policy sooner than expected.
Conversely, after the announcement of a 0.7% inflation for the entire euro area, the idea is spreading among market players that the European Central Bank (ECB) could ease its monetary policy.
The futures of Wall Street are predicting an opening of rising U.S. stocks, after two consecutive retreat sessions.
At values, Renault (-4.63%) recorded the strongest decline of the CAC 40, prompted by the result warning from its partner Nissan Motor on Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) marks the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, having also published declining results this morning and announced the creation of an in-house “bad bank” structure that brings together 38 billion pounds of the most risky assets.
Vodafone, for its part, (+2.45%) remains at the top of the EuroFirst300 increases in response to a press release that AT&T is studying a possible OPA.
In the foreign exchange market, speculation about the ECB’s monetary policy is going well, as John Hardy, a strategist at Saxo Bank, says.
The ECB’s single mandate has always been about inflation, so Mario Draghi and his team have more reason to act at next week’s meeting.
We anticipate a strong potential for the euro to fall.
In this context, the euro continues to retreat against the US currency and hit a two-week low in session at $1.3517.
These same conjectures, on the other hand, support the euro area bond market.
Supreme Court Approves Obama's Health System Reform Law
Big win for the Obama administration: The U.S. Supreme Court today declared the Obama-ratified health care reform law constitutional.
By 5 votes to 4, the judges validated the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – which requires citizens to take out health insurance by 2014, under penalty of having to pay a fine – and declared it to be constitutional under the government’s taxing power.
Supreme Court President John Roberts joined the four most liberal members of the Court, while Justices Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy voiced their disagreement.
The Court also validated the other sections of the 2,700-page law and also considered that the provision of the Health System Reform Act, which stipulates that the Medicaid eligibility threshold must be lowered if all federal funding of the program is to be lost, was coercive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure to block the law was initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major Republican candidates in the running presidential election during the 2012 primaries, including nominee Mitt Romney, have fiercely opposed the law.
Vibrant tribute to veterans in Menton
In the heart of the Trabuquet cemetery, civil, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, paid tribute this Friday afternoon to the soldiers and the dead of all wars.
Gerbs were deposited in two of the three military squares of the cemetery by the deputy mayor Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Israelis and Palestinians at the Gaza border <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Four Hamas fighters were killed and five Israeli soldiers wounded on Thursday evening during a violent stabbing at the Gaza-Israel border, the most serious incident in Palestinian territory in a year.
The only power plant in the Gaza Strip ceased operation on Friday, November 1, after its fuel supplies ran out, the Palestinian Energy Authority said.
A local commander of the Ezzedine Al-Qassam Brigades, Khaled Abu Bakr, and another member of Hamas’ armed wing, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a local tank shelling during an Israeli army incursion east of Khan Younes, in the southern Gaza Strip, according to medical sources.
Two other local Al-Qassam Brigades officials, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, were killed when an Israeli helicopter opened fire in the same area.
Their bodies were later discovered.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters were conducting a surveillance operation in the border area between the Palestinian enclave and Israel.
An attack on a tunnel dug by Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, an Israeli tank and an armored bulldozer made an incursion of a hundred meters into the territory before retreating.
The fight lasted about half an hour, according to witnesses.
In a statement, a Hamas spokesman, Sami Abu Zouhri, paid tribute to the four “heroes” and claimed that Israeli soldiers had been killed in the confrontation.
Hamas congratulates the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell defending the territory during a raid by the Zionist occupier in Khan Younes.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"Hamas assures that Gaza will be a hell for the occupier," the spokesman said.
For its part, the Israeli army said that the target of its operation was initially a section of a large tunnel dug in Israeli territory from the Palestinian enclave, discovered on October 7 and intended, according to the army, for "terrorist activities."
Hamas has claimed the use of tunnels to fight Israel, saying the goal was to remove Israeli soldiers in exchange for Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was aimed at preventing future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, an Israeli military statement said.
During the operation, Hamas fired an explosive device targeting IDF forces (the Israeli army) and wounded 5 soldiers.
Israel's attack on northern Syria
"This mission was imperative because of the risk of using the terrorist tunnel for attacks on Israeli civilians," Army spokesman Peter Lerner said.
In addition, Israel struck an air base in northwestern Syria, targeting a shipment of missiles destined for the Lebanese Shiite Hezbollah movement, the Al-Arabiya satellite channel reported on Thursday, October 31.
A U.S. official confirmed an “Israeli strike” but did not give details on the target.
"In the past, the targets have been missiles transferred to Hezbollah," he said.
Israeli government officials have refused to confirm any information regarding such an attack.
Citing “exclusive sources” it did not name, the Saudi-owned chain said that “the bombing targeted a shipment of ground-to-air missiles that was destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon,” referring to the powerful Lebanese Shiite movement fighting the rebels alongside Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, reported several explosions heard at dawn on Wednesday at an air defense base in Sonar Jablé, near Latakia, on the Syrian coast.
This organization, based on a network of activists and medical sources, had not been able to identify the origin of the explosions.
Back in black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents in Danse Danse her two new group choreographies: the first inspired by the inks and poems of Henri Michaux, the second inspired by the famous piano solos Gymnopédies de Satie.
An evening that allows you to see the whole prism of Chouinard, from art to tics and ink black to white.
A white screen serves as a background wall.
On the carpet, so white, in the immense space that is the Maisonneuve Theatre, advances, of profile, fine as a line and dressed in black, a body.
On the screen, a Henri Michaux ink is projected.
The body, a simple line, takes its form.
And this form will be that of the whole room: a string of physical imitations of the drawings.
The dancers, fully dressed in black, only the hands and face uncovered, wait on each side of the playing area, rush when the next graphic appears, embody it, come out running.
This black and white game by Henri Michaux is done in solo relays, in a unison group (a mass that makes solo), in a large group of twelve solos where each performs his sign.
We think of "Glory of the morning", where, in solo, Chouinard performed a series of choreographic tasks written on posters, posed online at the front stage.
This is the same principle, giant PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is strong, percussion and electric guitars.
The energy is high, the pace is always fast.
There will be a break when Carol Prieur will take refuge under the dance mat, to deliver, micro in hand, without sobriety or restraint, a part of Michaux's poem, monocord and monotonous in the shout, and will continue dancing.
And the music to go back, and the sequence to resume.
This sound and energetic discharge, long, if possible, ends up deafening and numbing.
As does the regularity of the visual rhythm.
There are a few beautiful flashes - image creation has always been a strength at Chouinard - like those hairs that get dizzy or those black fabrics that lengthen the lines.
But the choreographic approach lacks composition.
It seems that the choreographer, instead of going to meet the work of Michaux, imposed herself, with her tics.
The result: the bodies appear flat in front of the drawings.
Michaux’s inks, like Gestalt forms, open a wider and gibbous imagination than dance, more porous.
Only the ending, in the negative, with its dancers chopped by a stroboscopic light and the white signs in a suddenly black theater, touches the magic.
The public liked it, the welcome was warm.
The Gymnopédies, after the intermission, is richer.
The stage is partly draped in gray, the dancers and a piano are covered in fabrics, like furniture in an abandoned house.
At the piano, dancers take turns playing the scores.
Their misdirections in music, touching, give a real fragility.
On stage, couples pass, in love duets, very sensual, even erotic.
Group work, small transition solos, moving ensembles, choirs, writing is less binary.
Buffoons, also familiar to Chouinard, appear, with red noses, in very polarized male-female love parades.
Loves are carnivores, runaways, or gamblers.
Gestures, laughter and small cries beautifully transpose the archaic, grace and ridicule of coit bodies, of merging beings.
But the piece takes its real flight after salvation.
A clown returns to the stage when the audience leaves.
There, everything becomes permissible: the fourth wall falls, the explored universes overlap, the cabotage dancers, descend among the spectators, gloss, smoke, short circuit, play codes of applause, stretch the sauce in a cleverly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Joy and madness are transpiring, and it is Chouinard’s art there to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei face legal action over Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of former Nortel patents, began an avalanche of patent lawsuits Thursday against mobile phone makers, including Google, the company it co-captured at the patent auction that took place after Nortel's bankruptcy.
Rockstar, the consortium that acquired Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, has filed a lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement before the U.S. Court of Assizes in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused of violating seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that make it possible to display advertising related to Internet search terms, said the conclusions of the trial, which is the heart of Google’s business.
It was not possible to reach representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacture phones that run under Google’s Android operating system, which delivers fierce competition to Apple and Microsoft mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial $900 million offer for Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offer several times, eventually offering $4.4 billion.
After losing Nortel’s patents to Rockstar, Google subsequently acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a market partly based on Motorola’s patent library.
“Although it failed in its bid to acquire the patents in question during the auction, Google has violated and continues to violate those patents,” the lawsuit said.
Rockstar is calling for more damage and interest against Google because it claims that Google’s patent infringement is obstinate, according to the complainant.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a faulty water heater at the origin of the explosion
The grandmother would have lit a cigarette during a gas leak.
The explosion at a home in Gesves, which left two seriously injured Friday morning, a 52-year-old grandmother and her 5-year-old grandson, is due to a gas leak from a faulty water heater, the King's deputy prosecutor said on Friday night.
The expert sent on site by the prosecution ensures that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandmother lit a cigarette while there was a leak and gas accumulation.
The vital prognosis of the two victims is still in place.
The grandmother was thrown by the explosion and is severely burned.
The little boy, who was staying with his grandfather and his companion, was by his side and was burned more lightly.
"The two victims were intubated and extensively conditioned on the spot before being taken to the CHU of Li<0xC3><0xA8>ge, she in a helicopter, him in an ambulance," said the mayor José Paulet, who descended on the scene.
Traumatized, the grandfather was upstairs at the time of the explosion.
Healthy and safe, he was able to reach the ground floor by the stairs remaining intact while the back wall of the house was totally destroyed.
The grandfather and the tenant of the neighboring house, weakened by the explosion, were relocated by the president of CPAS.
The firefighters of Andenne and Namur and the police of the Arches intervened.
The civil protection of Crisnée stabilized both buildings.
Egypt asks the first freely elected president to take an oath
Mohamed Morsi has taken the oath of office, but it is unlikely that his day of triumph will mark the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he took the oath of office, becoming the first freely elected president and succeeding Hosni Mubarak who was ousted from power 16 months earlier.
During his inauguration before the High Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president in the Arab world and the fifth head of state in Egypt since the overthrow of the monarchy 60 years ago.
He took an oath in front of the 18 black-robed judges of the Court whose building on the banks of the Nile was built to resemble an Egyptian temple.
“We aspire to better tomorrows, a new Egypt and a second republic,” President Morsi said during the solemn ceremony broadcast live on public television.
“Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, true democracy and stability,” said Morsi, a 60-year-old U.S.-trained engineer from the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group considered for more than 84 years since its formation as a successful, hard-hitting, illegal government organization.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Mr. Morsi arrived shortly after 11 a.m. local time, followed by a small convoy.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the Court to cheer on the new president and, standing out from the presidential splendour of the Mubarak years, traffic was only briefly interrupted to allow his convoy to pass through the busy streets connecting the city centre to the southern suburbs.
Considered as the uncharismatic “relief wheel” of the Muslim Brotherhood, his personal prestige has grown considerably since his victory and Friday speech during which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of Islamists but of all those who want to finish the work begun during the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Moak president.
“Egypt today is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” Mohamed Morsi, wearing a blue suit and red tie, told judges in the woodwork-adorned room where he took an oath.
Later, Mr. Morsi went to the University of Cairo where he delivered his inaugural address.
He was officially welcomed by a military fanfare that played the national anthem as he stood guard over you.
Marshal Hussein Tantaoui attended the ceremony.
Upon his arrival, he was greeted by the song "The People and the Army, Hand in Hand..." sung by thousands of people gathered in the great amphitheater of the university.
Founded in 1908 and a former bastion of secular education, Cairo University later became a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday on Tahrir Square, where the uprising that ended Mubarak’s authoritarian regime last year came from, and vowed to reclaim the presidential powers that the military council, which replaced the ousted former president, dispossessed him.
But by agreeing to take an official oath before the Court, rather than before Parliament as is customary, he bows to the will of the army by showing that the struggle for power is not over.
Mr. Morsi’s speech on Tahrir Square was accompanied by spectacular populist gestures.
The shutdown in the United States has slowed the rise of the automotive market
The 16-day shutdown of most federal governments weighed on U.S. car sales growth in October, according to figures released Friday by automakers, five of the top six having outperformed expectations.
Detroit’s three major automakers posted double-digit growth compared to October 2012, but only General Motors did better than expected.
Analysts were anticipating an average of 15.4 million annualized and seasonally adjusted sales, but the market stood at 15.3 million, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas.
In a note to the bank’s customers, he said the slight brake was primarily due to “the government’s ‘shutdown’ and its impact on consumer sentiment during the first fortnight of the month.”
GM, however, reported an increase of nearly 16% in sales last month to 226,402 vehicles, compared to 211,563 expected by the consensus.
The four brands in the group saw their business performance improve compared to October 2012.
Ford, which continues to benefit from the success of its pick-ups, saw its sales increase 14% year-on-year to 191,985 vehicles, while the consensus was waiting for 194,301.
For its part, Chrysler, controlled by Fiat announced an 11% increase in its sales to 140,083 vehicles, compared to 143,536 expected.
Toyota and Nissan also posted lower-than-consensus sales, despite year-on-year increases of 8.8% and 14.2% respectively.
On the New York Stock Exchange, GM stock gained 1.4% at 16:35 GMT while Ford traded 1.1%.
Renault Sealed on the Stock Exchange by Nissan Warning
Renault on Friday blamed the sharpest drop in the SBF 120 index in Paris after its partner Nissan Motor announced it had cut its annual net profit forecast by nearly 20 percent, traders report.
Nissan, which had to carry out such a review, also announced a reshuffle of its management.
Several traders reported that the Renault stock was affected this morning by the "warning".
“This is clearly Nissan’s profit warning,” says a Parisian broker’s trading manager.
As part of the Renault-Nissan alliance, Renault holds 43.4% of Nissan's capital and the Japanese manufacturer 15% of French, according to data from Nissan's website.
Greece: Two killed in shooting near neo-Nazi party premises
Two people were killed and another was seriously injured Friday night by shots fired by two people who were on a motorbike passing in front of a Neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party premises in the western suburb of Athens, a police source said.
The police were not able to provide information on the identity of the victims and their possible political affiliation.
Some Greek media reported that members of Golden Dawn had claimed that the victims were guards of their premises.
The injured person was immediately hospitalized, according to the same source.
Police from the anti-terrorist service rushed to the central avenue of the suburb of Neo Iraklio, where the incident took place and closed the neighborhood.
The incident comes a few weeks after the indictment of six deputies of Aube dorée, including the leader and founder of the party, for participation in a "criminal organization" as part of an offensive against this party launched after the death of an anti-fascist musician by one of its members.
Scott Brown's appeal rejected
Scott Brown, the Celtic Glasgow captain, has seen his appeal rejected and will be well-suspended for the next two Champions League games of his club, against Ajax and AC Milan.
Expelled against Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a for sending a blow to Neymar, the Scottish side saw its suspension extended to three matches by UEFA.
In a statement, his club said it was "very disappointed" that his appeal was fully justified.
Nearly 50,000 homes are without electricity across the province, shortly after noon Friday, due to strong winds hitting many areas along the St. Lawrence River.
The sectors most affected are the Laurentians with 15,042 subscribers plunged into the dark, the Montérégie with 13,464 and the Outaouais with 8642.
The greater Montreal region is also experiencing its own set of outages with nearly 7,000 private homes running in the metropolis and in Laval.
Did you think travel agencies belonged to the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to reverse the trend.
The company has revised its net profit forecasts upwards and is hoping for record results thanks to vacationers from Australia and the UK.
The travel agency now expects to make an underlying profit over the full fiscal year ranging from $325 million to $340 million before taxes, against a previous forecast of $305 million to $315 million.
If current forecasts are met, this will represent 12 to 17 per cent growth over the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
The CEO, Graham Turner, said Flight Centre had made 8% of profits in the first half and that the second half had started in force, particularly with respect to non-business travel to Australia and the UK.
“Since the beginning of the year, the 10 countries in which we are present are profitable, and several of them are on track to achieve record results over the entire year before interest and tax deductions,” he said.
This concerns Australia and the United Kingdom, which are generally the countries that generate the largest profits.
In Australia, the leisure travel sector rebounded during the second half of the year, compensating for a slight decline in the domestic business travel market.
Similarly in the UK, Flight Centre’s leisure travel sector has performed well while business customers have spent less.
Its U.S. subsidiary recovered its losses in the first half of the year, where seasonal demand was lower and was expected to make a profit over the full year for the third time in a row.
Flight Centre shares rose by 3 cents to $38.20 yesterday.
Strangers shoot at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo
Concealed unknowns opened fire on Friday at a hotel near the pyramids of Cairo in Egypt without making any casualties, as a result of an apparent feud with laid-off employees.
The assailants fled, Interior Ministry spokesman General Abdel Latif said.
The attack comes as Egypt has received virtually no tourists since the army sacked Islamist President Mohamed Morsi in early July and repressed the protests of its supporters in blood.
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, spelling, and grammar.
As part of the English literature classes, students will be required to study at least one play by Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, a romantic poem, and a work of contemporary British fiction from 1914 to the present day.
The review will also present "new texts" to encourage a more diverse reading.
A course combining English literature and language will be deleted.
Starting in 2015, students will be required to pass an independent language GCSE, and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate qualification in English literature.
The Ministry of Education is due to publish its new English and Maths programs tomorrow – the first subjects to undergo a radical revision.
It will make changes in other core subjects next year.
Ofqual, the Exams Regulatory Office, will also unveil a reshaping of the structure of the CSEs, with a new rating system and fewer courses.
Speaking during the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was "a broad consensus on the need to reform our review system to restore public confidence", stressing that the CSEs would be "more challenging, more ambitious and more rigorous".
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week during the school year) than most other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer an average of 143 hours per year, and students in Singapore do about 138 hours.
While there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of time to maths, sources close to the coalition government indicated that the GCSE’s in-depth maths – as well as the greater importance attached to subjects in international rankings – would likely encourage schools to provide more hours of classes.
The program will focus more on "real-world problems," including financial mathematics.
This ruling means that a law passed in July in that state that largely calls into question the right to abortion will be able to enter into force.
An octogenarian welcomes children with a rifle at the Muy for Halloween
Teenagers aged 9 and 13 were making door-to-door calls for candy on Halloween night.
One of the neighbors of the Muy neighborhood visited by the children opened the door by holding his hunting rifle.
The 86-year-old man told police he was scared.
His gun was seized.
Former Gestapo chief buried in Jewish cemetery
M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, who disappeared at the end of World War II without ever being found, was actually buried in a mass grave in a Jewish cemetery in Berlin, says the leader of the German Resistance Memorial, Professor Johannes Tuchel, in Bild.
M<0xC3><0xBC>ller did not survive the end of the war.
“His body was buried in 1945 in a mass grave in the Jewish cemetery in Berlin-Mitte,” he told the daily newspaper in large print, drawing on archival documents.
This revelation, 68 years after the end of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi regime, would answer one of the great post-war enigmas.
The German secret services, the BND, thus ensured that during the summer of 1949, M<0xC3><0xBC>ller was in Karlovy Vary, then in Czechoslovakia, according to a document obtained by Bild.
The Secret Service was totally wrong.
“As early as August 1945, M<0xC3><0xBC>ller’s body was found in a temporary grave near the former Reich Aviation Ministry by a commando,” Tuchel said.
He was wearing a "general's uniform."
“In the inner left pocket were in particular his states of service with a photo,” he continues.
Bild also publishes a document from the borough town hall of the Mitte district in Berlin indicating that he was buried in the Jewish cemetery of the district.
The president of the Central Council of Jews of Germany, Dieter Graumann, said he was shocked by this revelation.
That one of the most brutal Nazi sadists should be buried in a Jewish cemetery is a huge distaste.
"The memory of the victims is being grossly trampled on," he said in the newspaper.
Heinrich M<0xC3><0xBC>ller is one of the important figures of the Third Reich who have never been captured.
He participated in the Wannsee conference in January 1942, which decided on the "final solution" and had under his command Adolf Eichmann, responsible for the "logistics" of the extermination of the Jews, sentenced to death and executed in Israel in 1962.

Dr. Georges Bwelle Provides Free Health Care in Cameroon’s Villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend seeing hundreds of patients.
There are not many doctors in this West African country, just 1 per 5,000 inhabitants.
Vote here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 CNN Heroes of the Year 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, to elect him “CNN Hero of the Year.”
This person will receive $250,000 to continue his or her extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father alternate periods of consciousness and unconsciousness and go to hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon.
At first, he only had one broken arm, but he contracted an infection that spread to his brain, creating a hematoma from which he would carry the aftermath for the rest of his life.
“There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon,” said Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him abroad if we had had enough money.
Instead, Dr. Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to crowded clinics and hospitals, so he could get any treatment he could get.
“It’s not easy,” adds Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5 a.m., rush to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
People can die because they wait too long.
The situation has not changed much since Dr. Bwelle’s father died in 2002.
In Cameroon, there is only one doctor per 5,000 inhabitants, according to the World Health Organization.
For comparison, the ratio in the United States is 1 doctor per 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Cameroonians could not afford the consultation.
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line, and almost three-quarters of the country’s health spending is in the private sector.
“The only problem they have is poverty,” said Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot enjoy life.
After seeing his father and so many of his compatriots suffer, Dr. Bwelle was determined to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his team of volunteers performed more than 700 surgical acts for free over the past year.
He became a physician himself, working as a vascular surgeon at Yaoundé Central Hospital.
And he created a non-profit humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, with about thirty people, they pile into vans after fixing the medical equipment on the roof and cross difficult terrain to get to the villages that need the most help.
Luck doesn’t always follow them.
They repeatedly had to push the vehicles to cross rivers or muddy tracks.
But when they arrive, they are welcomed as heroes: the community organizes a party, sings and dances and offers them the best accommodation available.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to party, and Dr. Bwelle – with his big smile and overflowing energy – is more than happy to join the festivities.
The next morning, the team began to receive hundreds of patients.
“We receive 500 people each visit,” said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live 60 km from the village, and they come on foot.
In this traveling hospital, various health care is provided.
Many people receive treatment for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others may receive crutches, a collected pair of glasses or a free birth certificate – a document needed to go to school, but many poor families simply can’t afford to buy it.
In the evening, the team performs simple surgical procedures under local anesthesia.
Operations are usually performed in a school, town hall or house; after the intervention, the patient gets up and goes to the wake-up room to leave his or her place to the next person.
Thanks to the lighting of the generator set, the operating room and the sterilization of the equipment, Dr. Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It’s a tiring pace, but village musicians generally help the team stay motivated.
“They’re knocking on drums all night to keep us awake so we can keep working,” Bwelle said.
On Sunday, the team returns to town, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group, made up of Cameroonian doctors and medical students, performed 700 surgical acts for free over the past year, and he knows that their presence can make all the difference for those to whom they come to help.
One man explained that the free operation he had undergone to treat a hernia would allow him to work again.
“It’s going to change my future and that of my family,” the man said.
In addition to bringing this traveling hospital to life and working as a surgeon in the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works at night in private medical offices around Yaoundé.
It is this second job, he explains, which finances 60% of his association; the rest is covered by private donations.
“I don’t know when he’s sleeping,” said Katie O’Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a volunteer in Dr. Bwelle’s group.
He is always in the hospital or trying to find money for his association so he can run these campaigns.
For medical students and nursing students like Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, this is a learning opportunity on the ground that they don't have at home.
“We were able to participate in operations to help flush the blood or pass the instruments to Dr. Bwelle,” Ms. O’Malley said.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a second-year medical student.
Volunteer students generally pay for their trip to Cameroon, and often arrive with collected medical equipment.
But once in Yaoundé, their pension, transportation and teaching are taken care of by Dr. Bwelle.
“He’s a hero, there’s no doubt about it,” said Katie O’Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the Cameroonian people is not nearly extinguished.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant workload is not a problem.
Helping others live happy lives by keeping the promise he made to his father is something that brings him immense joy.
“I’m so happy when I do this job,” Bwelle added.
And I'm thinking about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
Making people laugh and relieving pain are the reasons why I do this.

The Two Frances by Pierre Nora
Perplexed, academics have long struggled to define and locate Pierre Nora.
Professor in the amphitheatres and classrooms?
No doubt, but by highlighting its weakness for cross-roads, Sciences-Po, Hautes Etudes.
Arbitrator of the works of others in his office on rue Gaston-Gallimard?
Indeed, but ignoring the hidden work and the underground writing of the editor.
Heir of the chair that Fontenelle occupied at the Académie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise?
True again, but knowing that such a sacred can not replace the real holy oil, that of the thesis, of which he has passed.
They willingly recognized in him a great awaker, animator and federator of their work, but noting that he showed little inclination to produce it himself.
To this uncertain image the monument of the "Places of memory", to which he attached his name, also contributed.
The bad languages could see there a gigantic flea market, presented by an intelligent commentator, with a keen eye and erudite reading, but incurably entertaining.
The two books published by Nora almost two years ago have already established that the one who passed for not writing had a lot and well written.
This book should definitely do him justice.
Yet there is, once again, the temptation of ubiquity, intellectual vagabondage, the jubilation set to jump as if on foot together from one subject to another.
But it is quickly understood that the disparate objects collected in this book in such a beautiful way bring the broker back to one and the same passion: that of discovering the constitutive node of the French identity.
Why these dramatic calls for national unity?
Identity: This is an age-old concern.
A few years ago, we were collectively invited to give a definition.
But in the peremptory spirit of our leaders at the time, the French identity was a timeless essence.
It was only necessary to deploy the accidents, and the case, Jacobinism obliges, was entrusted to the prefects and to the sub-prefects, authorized interpreters.
The one that Peter Nora is chasing is quite different.
He does not inherit an eternal frankness, he refuses to define it.
An anxious analyst of a familiar strangeness, he wanders into a forest of symbols, stopped at every step by a rebus-shaped object, tormented by irritating questions.
Hence the latter, which is born of the company itself: why, in a country so sustainably established within its borders, so formerly framed and solidly masonned, do we hear these dramatic calls for unity?
They are so urgent, suggests Pierre Nora, only to ward off the disorder born of the discords of French history.
Franks and Gauls, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and Protestants: the forces of division here are very ancient.
And the most emblematic is, of course, the one that divides national history in two.
Beginning with the earthquake of the Revolution, the French have two histories and they have two nations, one monarchical, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but did not succeed in denying it; on the contrary, she was anxious to regain its sacredness and all the more eager for unity and indivisibility, since she had cut off the head of the one who was its obvious and powerful incarnation.
And, from there, an invincibly binary nation, divided between left and right, secularism and Catholicism, adoration and hatred of the revolution.
To make this singularity of French identity felt, nothing is worth the four steps out of the Hexagon, so that Pierre Nora’s American escape could well be the heart of his book.
Because America and France have revolutionized each other, drafted a declaration of rights, wanted to found a new society.
But the American stitching only makes it better to emphasize what is our own.
There, men who had left their Old Regime in England and no longer had to worry about it.
Here, men crammed with an Ancient Indigenous Regime, and all the more radical.
There was a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drama and confection.
There are always honored founding fathers, and here are revolutionary ancestors who are struggling to make models, and who have killed each other for the rest.
Here an institutional consistency, and here a cascade of constitutions, like so many mistakes to catch and attempts to resume.
The France that goes, the France that comes
Yet there was a time when the French believed they could sew back the torn dress of their history, and defeat the curse of the number two.
At this Third Republic, central and creative moment, Pierre Nora showed a lot of interest and even tenderness: greeting those who then worked to repair the revolutionary fracture, teaching schoolchildren everything that in ancient France was darkly preparing modern France and offering them a unified version of their history.
But this pacified identity has only had one time.
Here it is again in debate, shaken by immigration of a new type, threatened by the rise of demanding minorities, absorbed into the European space.
The book therefore offers both the fascinating portrait of France leaving and the circumspect sketch of France coming.
With, as a bonus, the portrait of the historian, who should reserve a few surprises.
We find out that the chimney was a casserole.
The man of multiple curiosities revolved, slightly obsessively, around the same idea.
The railing was in the centre of the centre.
And the one who had filed, more than half a century ago, a subject on the idea of nation, but had refrained from the initiatory exercise of the thesis, confides to us, cum grano salis, that he will eventually do it.
Certainly in a less rigid, more bursting and more subtle form.
But we are not mistaken, just as binding.
For much more than the imposed figure of the university curriculum, this thesis says the inner necessity of a life.
A former hostage in Lebanon: "The return is quite complex to manage"
Abducted in Beirut on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenna 2" team who came to film a Hezbollah demonstration, journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released nearly 21 months later, on 27 November 1987.
Retired since 2008, he participated in 2004 in the creation of the "Hostages of the World" hostage defense association, which he has chaired for several years.
Its main objective is to provide the possibility for hostages to file a complaint and to bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Detained for more than 1,000 days, the four hostages of Aqmi (Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Pierre Legrand and Marc Féret were released on Tuesday.
After medical examinations at the military hospital in Val-de-Gr<0xC3><0xA2>ce on Wednesday afternoon, they have since been able to find their families.
And try, little by little, to resume the course of their lives.
"Le Nouvel Observateur" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62, former reporter, retired since 2008, president of the association "Otages du monde".
From the evening of your release, you were on the 20h set of "Antenna 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
In particular, in Beirut.
When I'm released, I find myself in the trunk of a car where I meet - without seeing it because it's black - Roger Auque.
He tells me "we're free," but I'm not sure, and he tells me we can still be killed.
We are very excited, but also very tense.
It is war, and those who lead us are also very tense.
They put us on the edge of a sidewalk.
There are Syrian military.
We then arrive at the Summerland Hotel where the press is present.
French people are taking us to the French Embassy.
This is the time of the first phone calls to parents, family, friends, the press...
I remember taking a bath for an hour.
And having dinner in a t-shirt at the French embassy.
I also remember a short night of chatting with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there as we have no means to evacuate to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
Arriving there by helicopter, we take a private plane that takes us back to France via Corfu and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How did you arrive on French soil?
We landed at Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is here.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible jolt.
And a lot of media.
When I left, there were three television channels.
I'll be back and there's plenty of them.
The descent from the flight of stairs, the reunions with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Between the airport and my home, many motorcycles follow our car that Roussin drives.
The bikers take the plunge to take pictures and follow me to my house where I have to do a little police to prevent some from getting up.
The media pressure is enormous.
It doesn't stop, we are well placed to know...
But the state of emotion and fatigue is such that it is difficult to see clearly.
We get out of a hole and we're suddenly under the media spotlight.
It's a little complicated, a little violent, quite complex to handle.
But we did the hardest.
The next day, I’m at 8 p.m., and the next day, I’m on TV.
Then start some kind of life rehabilitation, very gently, for a month or two that are a bit like a vacation.
How were the medical examinations and DGSE debriefing?
I had the right to a first medical check-up in Corsica.
The rest was done in Val-de-Gr<0xC3><0xA2>ce the days following my return: radios, examinations of all kinds and meeting with a psychiatrist.
It is not a session that does everything, but we know that we can count on it, remind it if necessary, that we are not delivered to ourselves.
It's part of the procedure.
I also met with the intelligence services.
They asked me questions about the hostage takers.
It made sense.
It didn't bother me.
How do you react today to the liberation of the four hostages in Niger?
I'm listening to what they say.
The debate on ransoms in particular.
Some things annoy me, others less.
I try to share things between the questions about my past as a hostage and my hat as president of the association "Otages du monde" which allows me to put away, and I find it much more interesting to address.
I wonder, for example, about the definition of resilience.
Above all, I fight, with others, for the recognition of the legal status of the hostage.
I think there is a semantic problem.
The taking of hostages should be described as "political" - which is the case most of the time - and allow the hostages to have access to justice, to complain and to bring their hostage-takers before the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these hostages.
But who says these hostages might have access to justice too?
A court in The Hague is made for this.
Why not say to the hostage-takers "you have violated the rules of war, like those of all the Geneva Conventions, we will bring you to justice"?
Yet it seems to me justified, legitimate, struck with common sense.
This message is heard, but not heard, and it shocks me.
This is my main fight.
Egyptian Islamists in the street to denounce Morsi’s trial
Anger rages in the ranks of the Egyptian Islamists.
Two days before the trial of ousted President Mohamed Morsi, they took to the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to demand the restoration of the country's first democratically elected president.
This is not a trial, this Muslim Brotherhood activist points out.
So far no lawyer has been able to meet him and no volunteer has been able to take a copy of the case documents.
It's not a trial, it's a farce.
The trial of President Morsi is a false trial insurgent pro-Morsi, it is he who is supposed to judge Sisi, not the other way around.
Morsi must judge Sisi for the Rabaa massacres, the Nahda massacres, and the Republican Guard massacre.
Sisi is a liar and a traitor.
Clashes broke out in Alexandria, police used tear gas, and 60 protesters were arrested.
On Monday, 20,000 police officers will be deployed in front of the Cairo Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be tried.
Hagel Accuses 9 U.S. States of Violating Homosexual Rights
Since the federal state recognized same-sex marriage, “all military spouses are entitled to a Department of Defense ID card and the benefits that come with it,” the minister said in New York in an address to the Anti-Defamation League to fight anti-Semitism.
"But some states refuse to issue these cards to same-sex spouses at National Guard facilities" located in their territory, he denounced, accusing those states of violating federal law and the principle of equality.
Without these cards, these people cannot benefit from the many social or health services provided in these bases, or access their stores.
The Secretary of Defense said he had ordered the head of the National Guard, General Frank Grass, to ensure the implementation of the federal law.
The nine-state slump began with Texas refusing to implement these benefits on the Texas National Guard grounds, due to a conflict between Texas law and the federal gay marriage law.
He was joined in his refusal by Indiana, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Carolina and West Virginia, according to a senior defense official.
The Pentagon estimates the population involved in recognizing same-sex marriage at about 5,600 active people, including the National Guard, the Reserve, and retirees.
Sixth edition of the Play Skateboard this Saturday in Hy<0xC3><0xA8>res
The sixth edition of the Play Skateboard takes place this Saturday, November 2 at the skate park in Hy<0xC3><0xA8>res.
Organized by the SK8 Unity section of the Bump association, the competition is expected to bring together the best skaters in the region.
Entries are taken on site Saturday morning from 9 a.m. and the qualifying phases will begin in the afternoon, at 10 a.m., before the final scheduled at 3 p.m. and the awards ceremony at 4 p.m.
The public will be able to admire the technical prowess of young people who, for some, already attend competitions at the highest level, like the young prodigy Lorenzo Palumbo.
At just 10 years old, he has already won his place for the European Championships in Copenhagen this year and he likes nothing more than to go back to competitors who exceed him by three heads.
Toronto mayor hunts down journalists who came to question him about a drug case
In Canada, the mayor of Toronto is suspected of drugging, according to several media outlets.
A video released to justice seems to support these suspicions.
The interested party, Rob Ford, has always denied having consumed crack, while acknowledging having a penchant for cannabis.
On Thursday, he drove several journalists from his property who had come to question him.
We also think that sometimes images don’t need explanation or comment.
A case of rabies detected in a cat in the Val-d'Oise
Authorities announced Thursday that a case of rabies had been detected in a kitten in the Val-d'Oise, apparently of foreign origin, while France has been free of indigenous cases since 2001.
The kitten was found on October 25 in Argenteuil and died on October 28.
The diagnosis of rabies was confirmed by the Pasteur Institute.
"An epidemiological investigation has been initiated to identify and take care of people who may have come into contact with this kitten between October 8 and October 28 inclusive," the Ministry of Health and Agriculture said.
"Five people who have been in contact with the kitten have already been identified" and received preventive treatment.
"In humans, the preventive treatment of human rabies, administered after contact with the carrier animal, but before the onset of symptoms, is very effective," the statement said.
Departments are now calling for persons who would have been bitten, scratched, scratched, or licked on a mucous membrane or skin damaged by this kitten or whose animal would have been in contact with this kitten between 8 and 28 October to contact on 08.11.00.06.95 between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. from 1 November.
“As France has been free of rabies since 2001, this kitten or mother has been imported from another country, not free of rabies,” the statement said.
The Ministry of Agriculture states that the last "indigenous" case of rabies recorded dates back to December 1998 on a fox and that "France was officially declared free of this disease in November 2001 by the International Office of Epizooties (OIE)".
A case of rabies on a dog illegally imported from The Gambia had been registered in 2008.
"Rabies is a deadly disease if not treated in time," the ministry said, and it can be transmitted for nearly 15 days before the first symptoms of the disease appear.
Obama backtracks on health care reform
Under a flood of criticism, President Obama returned yesterday to his unequivocal and often-repeated promise that “if you’re satisfied with your health plan, you can keep it.”
After hundreds of thousands of people received notices of termination from their service providers, Republicans have criticized the president over the past few days accusing him of deceiving the American people.
Yesterday, Barack Obama adjusted his original promise.
“The vast majority of people with health insurance that suits them can keep it,” he said in a speech in Boston.
Speaking of what he calls “a flurry in the news” about the terminations, President Obama urged Americans who were receiving these notices to look for new insurance in the market.
Most people will be able to get complete and better-suited health plans for the same price, or even cheaper than expected.
“You will win,” he said.
The Administration announced that it should not be surprised if the 5% of the population who take out their own insurance are forced to change their plan because their coverage does not meet the new standards required under the Affordable Care Act.
“Let me address these Americans directly: you deserve better,” Kathleen Sebelius said in her testimony before the Energy and Trade Commission in Washington.
Sebelius, who oversees the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, said the October launch of the online marketplace had failed “unfortunately.”
“I’m as frustrated and irritated as anyone,” she added.
I look forward to regaining your trust.
It was an exasperated Kathleen Sebelius who uttered this sentence, as she believed her mic cut, addressing an assistant sitting behind her at yesterday's Assembly session following a contentious exchange of views with Billy Long, Missouri Republican representative, to see if she should endorse her.
For more than three hours, Billy Long kept asking Ms. Sebelius why the “architect” of the Affordable Care Act had not voluntarily given up government-sponsored insurance to buy a plan through HealthCare.gov, which she now boasts to millions of Americans.
Vettel unveils a special helmet in Abu Dhabi
The lucky winner, Jake Vite Prekop, combined the colors of the German car brand and flag, while integrating the notions of speed and heat at the track level.
The German Sebastian Vettel, four-time Formula 1 world champion, has released a special helmet for the free trials of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Friday, the drawing of which was made by a 21-year-old Mexican fan.
Vettel has chosen from 1,500 designs sent from around the world, as part of a competition launched by one of the sponsors, a car brand, of its team.
He was invited to follow the Abu Dhabi GP, with a friend, and can therefore see the German champion up close, on the track and in his stand.
Vettel was supposed to wear this helmet on Friday and Saturday, for testing.
It is likely that he will have another special helmet on Sunday, for the race, intended to mark his 4th consecutive world title.
A resident of Aubervilliers launches his suburban Party
Above all, don't be fooled.
In the spirit of Abdel-Malik Djermoune, its founder, the "Party of the suburbs" is not only addressed to the suburbs.
I chose a map of France as a logo, he justifies.
When I speak of the suburbs, I speak to all those who are excluded from the great national family.
His project, presented Thursday at a press conference in his hometown of Aubervilliers, was born from the desire to better defend multiculturalism, this great cultural melting pot that characterizes primarily the neighborhoods.
My number one proposal is to create a ministry of multiculturalism, he says.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune, 50, a territorial attaché, now claims to be "100% apolitical" even though he has not always been neutral.
Militant in 2002 alongside Jean-Pierre Chevénement, he then supported Dominique de Villepin locally between 2010 and 2011.
I know that the values of equality that I advocate in my program are linked to the left, but if the people on the right are willing to support me, I will listen to them too, he continues.
It is only the extremist parties that I am not talking about.
In addition to multiculturalism, Abdel-Malik Djermoune has built his program -consultable on the Internet- from many topics supposed to speak to the inhabitants of the suburbs and especially to young people: the right to vote for foreigners, the legalization of cannabis, the civil majority at 16 years old, the rehabilitation of the function of building keeper...
It remains to find candidates to form lists and defend his ideas on the political scene. "For the 2014 municipal elections, this is likely to be fair," he admits.
It is a matter of time and money.
The Party of the suburbs should still be represented in Aubervilliers through my candidacy and I hope also in other cities.
Abdel-Malik Djermoune claims to already have seven list heads in metropolitan France and Martinique.
“And the support emails I’ve received since yesterday don’t all emanate from the suburbs,” he said.
John Kerry admitted, unprecedentedly, that U.S. spying “had gone too far inappropriately.”
John Kerry has indicated a softening of the United States’ defensive attitude towards its surveillance programs by admitting, unprecedentedly, that on several occasions, espionage “has gone too far inappropriately.”
The Secretary of State also admitted that he, like Barack Obama, ruled on “automatic pilot” when a series of incendiary revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA spying activities emerged.
The leaks put the U.S. government at the center of a diplomatic storm with its allies.
Speaking at an intergovernmental conference in London via video link, Mr. Kerry said: "It is undeniable that the President, myself and other members of the government have become aware of certain things in automatic pilot mode because we had the possibility, from the Second World War and up to the difficult years of the Cold War, then of course September 11."
He later became the first high-ranking member of the U.S. government to admit that U.S. spying had gone beyond limits, but insisted that everyone’s rights had not been violated.
He said: “In some cases, it went too far inappropriately.”
And the President is determined to try to clarify and make clear to people that he is now undertaking a thorough review of these practices so that no one feels misled.
I assure you that innocent people will not be victims of abuse as part of this process.
Kerry insisted, however, that the NSA was a force acting for good and that its surveillance operations had saved many lives.
He added: “We live in a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.”
There is a radical extremism in the world that is determined to try to kill people, blow them up and attack governments.
What if you could intercept their communications and stop them before they act?
We have indeed prevented planes from falling, buildings from exploding and people from being murdered because we have been able to get to know the facts in advance.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to address concerns about the alleged U.S. spying case and convince Europeans of the need to continue joint counterterrorism efforts with the United States, the president of the Senate subcommittee on European affairs said Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he had spoken to members of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about the threats they had made regarding a possible withdrawal of anti-terrorist organizations due to the frustration of surveillance by the National Security Agency.
“It’s really important for the protection of national security in the United States that Europeans stay by our side in the mutual commitment to fight terrorism,” Murphy, a Democrat serving his first term, and chair of the US Senate’s subcommittee on European Affairs, said in an interview from Washington.
And I'm going to go to Europe to make them understand that we must continue to work together to fight terrorism, despite the anger caused by the NSA's programs.
The press reports that the NSA has intercepted millions of communications in Europe, which has damaged relations with some US allies, however the director of the agency said this week that it was inaccurate and that it was a misunderstanding because it concerned metadata that NATO allies had collected and shared with the US.
Other revelations cited documents released by Snowden that the NSA had intercepted data and communications from the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and those of 34 other heads of state.
The Director of Intelligence, James Clapper, justified the spying of the allies by stating that it was necessary and that it was a common practice on both sides.
In this tumultuous atmosphere, Murphy indicated that his office was organizing a trip to Congress, which is expected to take place this year, and that he hoped the delegation would include members of both parties and both chambers.
The names of other participating legislators are expected to be revealed in the coming days.
He indicated that the route remained to be defined.
Murphy stated that the purpose of this trip was to improve relationships, but also to show “affectionate firmness.”
He explained that European heads of state need to be honest with their citizens about the type of spying programs they have been implementing themselves for years.
“We can change our surveillance programs to better protect the rights of Europeans, but they also need to understand that we are not the only ones in the world doing espionage,” Murphy said.
In the meantime, Kerry has planned to travel to the Middle East and Poland this weekend to deal with the resentment generated by U.S. strategies in Syria, Egypt and Iran, as well as by U.S. surveillance activities.
The London Stock Exchange closed down on Thursday, buoyed by Shell’s poor results and the day after a Fed announcement of the continued state of its support for the economy, as expected.
Australian Woman Appeals for Prison Sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney resident, sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been assaulted by a taxi driver, appealed the judgment and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty by a Phuket Province Court on June 15 of false statements after telling Thai police that a local taxi driver, accompanied by two other men who controlled her, had assaulted her early on Sunday, June 10.
However, video surveillance footage later revealed that she had returned to her hotel safely after breaking up with her Australian boyfriend.
Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days before she confessed to inventing the story of all the pieces.
She was detained in a local police station cell prior to the court hearing.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security detention centre on the outskirts of Phuket rather than a women's prison.
It is the daughter of former Australian Rugby League player Peter Tunks, who called on the Canberra Foreign Ministry to help his daughter.
Tunks told the Sydney Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was "extremely concerned" about her daughter's well-being and wanted her to return to Australia.
“We’ve obviously had a distressing time, but we hope to bring her home safely as soon as possible,” Tunks said.
Bamford appealed the judgment and was released after paying a bail of 50,000 baht.
In Australia, the press said that in the meantime, she was on vacation in the Krabi region of southern Thailand.
Thai judicial sources said Bamford was represented by a local Phuket lawyer, but warned that the appeal could lead to an increase in the sentence of up to two years in prison and an incarceration in an adult prison.
However, following the recent killing in Phuket of Michelle Smith, an Australian travel agent, Thailand could also seek to rekindle its deteriorating image with tourists, which could lead to acquittal.
French police will arrest Anderlecht supporters who came in a different way than with RSCA buses
French police have decided to impose strict rules regarding the meeting of the Royal Sporting Club d'Anderlecht against Paris Saint-Germain scheduled on Tuesday, Marie Verbeke, spokeswoman for the Brussels-midday police zone, said on Friday.
Belgian fans of the RSCA who want to go to this meeting of the Champions League will necessarily have to use the travel system set up by the RSCA.
"The bus convoy will be escorted by the police from a former Rekem border post to the PSG stadium," the spokeswoman said.
The process will be the same for the return.
"If other supporters intended to travel to Paris by other means, the French police prefecture has announced that measures have been taken to make arrests or even on-call guards," Verbeke said.
Living together in French, the challenge of the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board
At the Marguerite-Bourgeoys school board, 62% of students have a mother tongue other than French.
This is what motivated a year ago a consultation with parents, students, teachers and education staff to think about ways to better integrate students who live on horseback across multiple cultures.
The school board has just unveiled its vision of "Living together in French".
Vision diversité has been walking through schools for a year to help students of all backgrounds discover common landmarks that are not limited to the French language.
The discovery of neighborhoods, our architecture, our places are landmarks.
Great names of writers, artists, whether they are of origin or whether they have come from elsewhere.
Who are our builders?
“So we’re creating projects so that they identify with all of that,” said Vision Diversity President Aida Kamar.
Michel Venne, from the Institut du Nouveau Monde, identified several challenges for the school board.
"On the transmission, for example, of what Quebec culture is, the sense of belonging, the support to the staff in the transformations that we live, within the student clientele," he enumerates.
The Marguerite-Bourgeoys School Commission has created a research centre that will give tools to teachers who, sometimes, also come from elsewhere.
Rachida Azdouz, from the University of Montreal, will be its scientific director.
The preparation to manage a class in a North American, Quebecian context.
“Different educational strategies are the real need,” she says.
The research will focus on inclusion from all angles: linguistic, school, social and cultural.
