A lot of people are worried about “looking like a clown.”
Uggur is in some councillors due to a proposal to have their title changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament, member of the Welsh Parliament).
Concerns have been raised over plans to change the name of the council to the Welsh parliament.
Councillors from all walks of life are concerned that it could make them sleepy.
One councillor from the Labour Party said his party was concerned that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers who live outside of Wales: in Welsh, twp means crazy and pwp means shit.
A councillor from Plaid Cymru said the group as a whole was "dissatisfied" and had made other suggestions to the effect.
A councillor from the Welsh Conservative Party said his party had "open mind" about the name change, but pointed out that there was not much difference between the word MWP and Muppet.
In this context, it can be stated that the letter w is pronounced similar to u in Icelandic.
The council, which is now working on the bill to table the name changes, said: “The final decision on all names that have been passed over the members of the council will, of course, rest with the members themselves.”
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gave the Welsh government the power to change its name.
In June, the council released the results of an opinion poll among the public that showed much support for calling the council the Welsh parliament.
As for the title of the councillors, the council elected WMP (Welsh Parliament members, Welsh MPs) but the MWP received the most public support in the polls.
According to the news, councillors are now putting forward other proposals, but it may be difficult to reach an agreement for the chairman of the council, Elin Jones, who is due to present a draft of the changes within a few weeks.
The reform agenda will also include other changes to the way the Council works, including rules on the removal of councillors and the organisation of the committee system.
Councillors will be able to pay a final vote on their title when the debate on the Prime Minister begins.
Macedonians go to the polls to vote on the name change in the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change their country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia."
This issue was put to the vote in an attempt to resolve decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
The city of Athens has long maintained the name of its northern neighbours equivalent to the claim on its territory and has repeatedly objected to their applications for membership of the EU and NATO.
The President of Macedonia, Gjorge Ivanov, who disagrees with the vote on the name change, has said that he will not look at the current elections.
Supporters of the vote, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have said that the name change is simply the price that must be paid to join the EU and NATO.
Church clock St. Martin's sounds are churches in Harlem have in difficulty
“The elderly people I’ve spoken to said that before, they could find a bar and a church on every street corner,” Adams said.
“There’s nothing there today.”
He said it was understandable that the bar would go down.
“People have different ways of meeting,” he said.
“Bars are no longer the center of the neighborhood where people come together regularly.”
As far as the churches are concerned, he is concerned that the proceeds from the sale of property will not last as long as leaders are expected to “and sooner or later they will be back to the starting line.”
He added that it was possible that churches would be replaced by housing that would be full of people who would not help save the neighborhood’s remaining terraced areas.
“The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white,” he said, “and will therefore rush to shut down these churches altogether, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches.”
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became the center of blacks – the Metropolitan Community Church was built in 1870, and St. Martin’s Church a decade later.
The original white methotrexate collection was moved away in the 1940s.
A group of black people who had worked in the area took over the building.
A collection of blacksmiths took over St. Martin’s Church under the guidance of Sir John Howard Johnson, who had the initiative to bribe shopkeepers on 125th Street, Harlem’s main shopping street, who longed to hire blacksmiths or give them positions.
The building was severely damaged in a fire in 1939, but members of Johnson's Sera congregation made plans to rebuild it and also had the clock game built.
Sir David Johnson, son and successor of Sir Johnson, called the clock game "the clock of the poor people."
The expert who played the clock game in July called it another name: “The Cultural Fund” and “a unique historical musical instrument.”
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the first clock game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, but he moved on to a larger clock game in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin would not have had anyone else in his place.
In recent months, many architects and contractors have made their way to St. Martin, some hired by church leaders and others from the diocese.
The Council of Churches – which oversees the parish and is appointed to church leaders – wrote to the Bishops’ Council in July and expressed its concerns that the Bishops’ Council “would seek to pass the cost on to” the Council of Churches, even if it had not involved the work of an architect.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency in the middle of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy Who Died of Humor in California
Authorities say a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him on Saturday when the boy was diving for lobster in California on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7 a.m. near Beacon’s Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and then drove across with a group of others to help him get out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was just a thrill to have reached the humerus, but then “he realized that the boy was shouting ‘I was bitten!
“I was bitten!”
All the bones on him were torn up," Hammel said of what he saw when he came to the boy.
“I cried out to everyone to get out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” added Hammel.
The boy was transported by helicopter to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is seriously injured.
It is not known what type of shark attacked the boy.
The head of the coast guard, Larry Giles, told a news conference that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks before, but he was not of a dangerous type of shark.
Giles added that the victim had sustained serious damage to the upper part of the body.
Authorities blocked beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami’s Beach in Encinitas for 48 hours, for research and security purposes.
Giles said over 135 different species of sharks were in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury’s plans to divest its cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury’s is going to compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with mall-style cosmetics and specially trained assistants.
This is part of a plan to enter the UK cosmetics market, which is worth <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion and continues to grow while sales of fashion and household goods are decreasing. Larger cosmetics shelves will be tested in 11 stores across the country next year and will be replaced by more verses
Investment in cosmetic products is part of a large-scale way to use a shelf space that was previously used by televisions, microwave ovens and household products.
Sainsbury’s says it plans to double its cosmetics range to up to 3,000 products, including brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Current products from L’Oreal, Maybelline and Burt’s Bees will also get increased space with marked areas similar to those found in stores like Boots.
The store also plans to re-sell its Boutique cosmetics range so that the majority of products are vegan-friendly, while younger consumers are increasingly demanding it.
In addition, the fragrance shop Fragrance Shop will test the product status of two Sainsbury’s stores, the first one opened in Croydon in south London last week and the next one will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham later this year.
Online shopping and the increased tendency of consumers to buy a small amount of food daily in the neighborhood stores means that supermarkets need to invest more in order to get people to come to them.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury’s, said the stores would look more like malls as the retail chain tries to fight the low-cost Aldi and Lidl stores with more service and other products than food.
Sainsbury’s has put Argos stores in hundreds of stores and has also introduced to history the number of Habitat stores since both chains were purchased two years ago. According to them, it has increased sales and made the purchase more profitable.
The previous attempt of the store to revive its cosmetics and pharmaceutical departments was not successful.
Sainsbury’s tested the collaboration with Boots around 2000 but it ended due to a dispute over how to share the proceeds from the sale of drugs in the supermarkets.
The new policy comes after Sainsbury’s sold its 281 drugstores to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyd’s drugstores, for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million three years ago.
Under the policy, Lloyds will play a role in these plans by adding a wide range of luxury skincare brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Marketing Director at Sainsbury’s, said: “We’ve made the look of our beauty products look like they’re designed to improve the environment for the customer.
We have also invested in special training for staff that will be available for advice.
Our brand selection is designed to meet every need. A welcoming environment and convenient locations make us an exciting cosmetics store that transforms old shopping habits."
Peter Jones 'always angry' after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11m deal
Peter Jones, the star of the series Dragons Den, became “evergreen” after TV personality Holly Willoughby quit his <0xC2><0xA3>11 million deal with his company to focus on new deals with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn’t have time for their household goods and accessories brand, Truly.
The company had been similar to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow.
Willoughby, a 37-year-old presenter on This Morning, announced her decision on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Peter Jones, the star of Dragons’ Den, in pain by quitting his last-minute participation in a popular lifestyle company to focus on new and lucrative deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones has been "eternal" at a tough meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his commercial empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire when the popular television woman acknowledged she didn't have enough time for the household goods and accessories brand Truly due to the new 1.5 coin denominations.
The company has been similar to Goop, the brand of Gwyneth Paltrow, and was intended to double Willoughby's assets, but their estimated value is <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was going to pull out of Truly fly Jones from the UK to stay at one of her many summer homes.
A source said: “Truly was the longest on Holly’s priority list.
This was to be her future project that would earn her income for the next two decades.
Her decision to quit was a clear one for all of us.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so short that the line went on the market.
There is a full stock of products in Marlow headquarters that are ready to go on sale."
Experts believe that the elimination of This Morning's promotion, which is among the UK's most popular stars, could cost the company millions due to large product investments, ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and household goods, and potentially cause further data to be leaked to the product line.
It could also be the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, the mother of three children, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been friends with Jones and his wife, Tora Capp, for decades.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined them as chairman in March.
The couple spend their summer vacations together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin, a television company.
Willoughby will become the official representative of the M&S brand and will replace Ant McPartlin as the director of the I'm a Celebrity ITV series.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We don’t want to say anything about his business dealings.”
It’s been a tough time, and we’ve been in love ever since.”
He regretted the criticism he received from the media, for saying something that many would consider inappropriate for the president, and for being so positive in the North Korean leader's garden.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said, echoing the voice of a reporter.
“I haven’t given up anything.”
He noted that Kim was interested in another meeting after Trump called their first meeting in Singapore in June a major step towards North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
However, negotiations to put down nuclear weapons have stalled.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s chief ambassador, told the U.N. General Assembly’s international leaders on Saturday that the North had not received an “appropriate response” from the U.S. in the first steps of the North’s transition to North Korea.
Instead, he said, the U.S. was continuing to uplift businessmen for the purpose of maintaining pressure.
Trump was even more positive in his speech.
“We are very close to North Korea,” he said.
“We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people have lost their lives.
Our relationship is great now.”
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had returned positive results - rocket tests would have stopped, hostages would have been released and the remains of U.S. troops would have been returned home.
He also had an unusual approach to discussing his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like the president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into a credulous arena, there were only 200 people standing there,” Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Floods and earthquakes in Indonesia cause great damage to the island, hundreds have died
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, international aid organizations were told that they would not be needed.
Despite the fact that over 10 percent of the population of Lombok had to flee their homes, an emergency was not declared, but there is a reason why international organizations can have relief activities there.
“In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it clear that they are not going to ask for help from international organisations, so this is difficult,” Ms. Sumbung said.
Although the Save the Children organization is putting together a team to travel to Palu, it is not yet certain when foreign aid workers can start work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the country’s anti-terrorism agency, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organisations should be allowed to assist with the aid work.
Given how common earthquakes are in Indonesia, the country is woefully ill-prepared to defend itself against natural disasters.
The floodplains have been erected in Aceh but they are rarely visible from other shorelines.
So it seems that the anticipation of flood defences in Palu has increased even more in the case of casualties, even though a warning has been issued.
Even in the best of circumstances, it can be a challenge to travel between the many islands in Indonesia.
Natural disasters make the planning process even more complicated.
A sick ship that has docked in Lombok to shelter the victims of the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new accident site.
President Joko Widodo made it a key part of his election campaign to improve Indonesia’s low-cost transport routes and has put a lot of money into roads and railways.
However, the lack of funds has plagued the government of Mr. Joko, but elections will be held next year.
Mr. Joko also needs to grapple with the ongoing tension between religious groups in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have devoted themselves to a more conservative religion.
Over 1,000 people died and tens of thousands were forced to leave their homes as the Christian and Muslim exchange rate struggled in the streets with swords, bows and arrows and other primary weapons.
See: Daniel Sturridge, Liverpool player, equals against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute of Saturday's game at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London.
Sturridge received a transmission from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal as his team was below 1-0.
He rolled the ball to the left and then tried to aim in the direction of the pole.
The ball flew high over the goal and in the direction of its right corner.
The ball finally went over Kepa Arrizabalaga, who jumped up, and into the net.
"I just wanted to try to get to this position, to get the ball, and players like Shaq always play it as far forward as possible so I tried to create for myself as much time as I could," Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
“I saw Kante come and touched once and didn’t think too much about it, just took the shot.”
Chelsea were over 1-0 in the semi-finals after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
In the chase, the Chelsea prospect gave the ball with a heel spur to Mateo Kovacic and then jumped from the centre to the Liverpool play-off half.
Kovacic let the ball run quickly between the centre.
Then he sent the ball off brilliantly and sent Hazard in for the batting.
Hazard ran away from the defenders and scored in the corner with a left-footed shot in front of Alisson Becker, Liverpool goalkeeper.
Liverpool play against Napoli in the finals of the division at 3 p.m. on Wednesday at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea play against Videoton in the UEFA European Championship at 15:00 on Thursday in London.
Death toll rises to 832 after Indonesia's floods
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, according to a report from the country's anti-terror agency early on Sunday.
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the institute, said at a news conference that the number of people had been buried when buildings collapsed in the earthquake that occurred on Friday and was 7.5 degrees on the Richter scale. The quake caused floods that reached up to 6 meters in height.
The city of Palu, which has a population of over 380,000, was razed to the ground by buildings that had collapsed.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman with an injection wound was found at 7:55 a.m. this morning near Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have urged people in the area to surrender if they saw or heard anything.
Brian O’Hagan, a research associate, said: “The investigation has just begun but I would ask all those who were near John Street in Birkenhead to contact us if they saw or heard anything suspicious.
I would also like to ask anyone, especially a taxi driver, who might have caught something on camera with their car cameras to contact us, because they might be able to come up with important information for our investigation."
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman who died in Birkenhead was found inside an apartment.
Late today, people who thought they knew the woman have come to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation continues and police say they are working to inform the victim’s closest relatives.
The taxi driver, who lives in Grayson Mews, tried to get back to his apartment but police told him that no one could enter or leave the building.
He was speechless when he discovered what had happened.
Residents have now been told that many hours may pass until they are allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman came to the scene.
She kept saying, “It’s so terrible.”
At 2:00 p.m., there were two police cars in front of the designated police area and one car just outside it.
A large number of police were stationed in the area and monitored the residential buildings.
Anyone who might have any information is asked to send a direct message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the Crime Line by phone on 0800 555 111 and give the number 247 as of September 30.
The support of the British Parliament by Cromwell is the latest monument accused of "rewriting history"
The ban would be a poetic justice for the Taliban’s destruction of his overtly puritanical followers on so many of England’s cultural and religious deities.
The Cromwell Society, however, said Mr Crick's suggestion was a "failure" and "an attempt to rewrite history."
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the debate over removing the short, it was inevitable that the short of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace would be for the battle.
The beginning of the English Civil War against cultural symbols was neither the decree nor the execution of Cromwell.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of Thomas his forefather in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft’s magnificent short story of Cromwell, set in the 19th century, is part of the story of a man who many believe is not yet worthy of praise.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Cromwell is considered by many, perhaps more late in the 19th century than today, to have been the protector of the House against outside pressure, in his case the monarchy.
There is still a lot of historical controversy as to whether this description is in any way correct.
However, it is certain that the conflicts of the mid-17th century have shaped the development of our nation and that Cromwell is a well-known individual who represents one side of their struggles.
It is worth celebrating and remembering his achievements as the protector of the state."
A pig attacks a Chinese farmer and kills him.
A pig attacked a Chinese farmer and killed him in a market in southwestern China, according to local news.
The man, who is only known by his last name "Yuan", was found dead with a ruptured artery and a blanket of blood near a stall in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, according to news reports from the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject a vaccine into pigs in a pig farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He said he had travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his uncle found him dead and saw that the door into a nearby pigsty was open.
He said that inside the hose there would have been a big hole with a bloody mouth.
A judicial investigation confirmed that the 250 kg fine had killed the farmer, according to the report.
“My uncle’s legs were bloody and injured,” said the uncle, surnamed “Wu,” at the Guiyang Evening News news agency.
A security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not owned by Yuan or his cousin.
The market owner told Evening News that the pig had been locked inside so that it would not attack anyone else while police collected evidence on the scene.
According to the news, the Yuan family and the market owners are in talks about compensation for his death.
There have been reports of people being attacked by pigs, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband at their Massachusetts farm and seriously injured the man.
Ten years earlier, 300 kg of pigs squeezed a farmer by a tractor until his wife threw the animal away.
After a farmer from Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, another farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but that the smell of blood can arouse their aggression.
“They’re just playing.
They like to forget and are curious... they don’t want to hurt anyone.
You just have to show them respect,” he said.
The remnants of the Rose Basin carry a large outflow across the southwestern United States.
As predicted, the strength of the volcano Rosa decreases as it crosses the cooler sea off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, R<0xC3><0xB3>sa will carry with it a large outflow that could cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States in the coming days.
Rosa became a Category 1 hurricane, with winds of up to 136 km per hour, at 5 a.m. on Sunday, and it was located approximately 600 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
It is expected that Rosa will go to the north on Sunday.
At the same time, there is a formation over the Pacific Ocean and it will move east towards the west coast of the United States. When Rosa arrives at the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a heat storm, a large heatwave will follow in the north-east into the south-western part of the United States.
The rose will accompany up to 25 cm of precipitation in some parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then the heat wave will mix with the approaching lows, forming a large and wide-spread outpouring across the southwest in the next few days.
A local 2.5 to 10 cm eruption can cause dangerous flash floods, movement of the soil and possible landslides in the desert.
A large heatwave will cause up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation per hour in some locations, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Up to 5 to 10 cm of precipitation is expected in some places in the southwest, especially in the largest state of Arizona.
There is a possibility of flash floods with corrosive conditions due to the distribution of heat belt rainfall.
People are strongly advised against walking out into the desert when there is a risk of heat-related rains.
Heavy rains can turn gulls into belgian rapids, and thunderstorms can lead to landslides and dust storms.
The approach will result in a local spill in certain areas along the Southern California coastline.
There is a possibility of more than 1 cm of precipitation that could cause slight movement of the soil and the stalk on the roads.
This is the first rain in the area.
Several scattered heatwaves will begin to approach Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, before the eruptions spread over larger areas late on Monday and Tuesday.
A major outbreak will spread across four counties on Tuesday and will end on Wednesday.
A significant change in temperature is expected in October throughout the United States, as the Arctic continues to cool, but the temperature remains rather warm.
Sometimes this can cause large heat waves over short distances.
A very good example of a large temperature difference was observed in the United States on Sunday.
There is a nearly 7 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, persistent summer frosts will try to build up and spread out again.
It is expected that a large part of the central and eastern United States will have a warm start in October with temperatures around 25 degrees or more from the plains of the south to the northeastern states.
Temperatures could rise to 25 degrees in New York City on Tuesday, which is about 6 degrees higher than the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates that there is a high probability of temperatures above average for the eastern part of the United States in the first part of October.
More than 20 million people have been interviewed by Brett Kavanaugh.
More than 20 million people watched the exciting testimony of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s nominee, on Tuesday and the testimony of Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct that was supposed to have taken place in the nineties.
At the same time, a political stalemate continued and television stations paused a regular agenda to publish the latest news on Friday: Jeff Flake, a senior Arizona congressman, presented a blueprint for the FBI to investigate the allegations in one week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was confident that Kavanaugh had drunk on her and tried to undress her at a school party.
Kavanaugh said in an emotional testimony that he was convinced that it had not happened.
More people are likely to have watched the trial than the 20.4 million Nielsen said they had watched on Friday.
The company measured the average viewing time on the television channels CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The figures were not immediately available for other TV channels that showed the auditions, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Also, Nielsen usually has trouble measuring people’s views in the office.
To put this in context, this audience is similar in size and for the final match in football or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, most of the auditions, which took all day, were watched on the Fox News Channel or 5.69 million. Opinions of that channel have supported the appointment of Kavanaugh daily.
ABC was in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
There was a lot of interest after the trial.
Flake was the centerpiece of Friday's game.
After the office of this Republican senator issued a statement that he would vote in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS obtained photos of him when protesters shouted at him on Friday morning, when he tried to enter a lift to get to a court meeting.
He stood silent for a few minutes while it rained on him in a live broadcast on CNN.
One woman said, “I’m standing right here in front of you.”
“Do you think he’s telling the people the truth?”
The people said to him, “You have authority over so many women.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement and before the elevator doors closed he said he would speak at the committee meeting.
The cable and television stations were all live-streamed later when the Judiciary Committee decided whether to continue Kavanaugh's nomination for election to the Division of Elders.
Flake said he would only do so if the FBI investigated the charges against the nominees next week, but a minority of Democrats have urged it.
Flake became convinced in part after a conversation with his friend, Chris Coons, a senior Democratic congressman.
Flake made his decision after talks with Coons and several other senior congressmen after that.
Flake's vote was reversed because it was clear that the Republicans did not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without the study.
President Trump has authorized an FBI investigation into Kavanaugh's allegations.
May, UK prime minister, accuses critics of ‘being in a political game’ over Brexit
In an interview with The Sunday Times, Theresa May, the prime minister, accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union to "be in a political game" about Britain's future and undermine the country's interests.
Theresa May, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, will attend the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, United Kingdom, on 29 September 2018.
In a second interview, which was published alongside her interview on the front page of the paper, Boris Johnson, her former foreign minister, conceded the so-called Chequers Brexit plan and said that the proposal that Britain and the European Union should remove tariffs from each other should be "another's tariff".
Wayde Sims shooting: Police arrest Dyteon Simpsons in connection with the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested one suspect over the death of Wayde Sims in a deadly shooting spree. He was a 20-year-old basketball player at LSU.
The 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder, according to police in Baton Rouge.
Officials posted a video of the fighting between Sims and Simpson and said Sims had lost their glasses in the attacks.
Police found glasses on the scene and said they had found genetics from the Simpsons on them, according to WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
Police say Simpson has confessed to interrogations that he shot Wayde and killed him.
According to his lawyer, the security was set at $350,000.
The office of the barrister in East Baton Rouge County released a preliminary report on Friday saying the cause of death was a gunshot to the head and down the neck.
Authorities wanted to thank the Louisiana Police Department, the Police Crime Investigation Bureau, the Southern University University Police Department, and the citizens of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
Joe Alleva, president of sports at LSU, thanked the lawyers for “their generosity and their search for justice.”
Sims was 20 years old.
The tall two-meter forward grew up in Baton Rouge where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He scored 5.6 points on average and took 2.6 rebounds for each game in the last season.
Will Wade, LSU basketball coach, said Friday morning that the team was "harmed" and "in a fit" due to Wayde's death.
“It’s something you’re always worried about,” Wade said.
Fire Mountain Spies Ashes Over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern part of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention in the United States advised Mexicans on Saturday to stay away from the volcano after activity increased in the volcano and 183 cases of gas and ash emissions were recorded over a 24-hour period.
The center was monitored by vibrations and tremors from the mountain of fire.
Pictures on social media showed a thin layer of ash on car windows in neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as in Xochimilco.
Terrestrial scientists have noticed increased activity in the volcano, which is 72 kilometers southeast of the capital, since the earthquake of 7.1 on the Richter rode over the central part of Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police in clashes with Catalan separatists on the eve of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands took part in protests on the occasion of the first anniversary of Catalonia's disputed elections to declare independence.
A group of masked separatists stoned riot police with eggs and threw a powder coating that formed a dark dust cloud on the streets, which were usually otherwise full of tourists.
The fighting also broke out later in the day and police used force to keep the fighting in check.
Groups of the separatists shouted, “We will not forget and we will not forgive” for several hours while their opponents shouted, “Long live Spain.”
Fourteen people were in need of treatment for minor injuries they sustained in the protests, according to local media.
A lot of tension continues in the independence-oriented region one year after the October 1 referendum was condemned as illegal by the authorities in Madrid, but was celebrated by the Catalan separatists.
The majority of voters chose independence, but participation was poor, as the majority of those who opposed the separation ignored the elections.
According to the Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were killed last year when police tried to stop the elections in polling stations across the region, which led to a conflict.
A group of independents had stayed out overnight on Friday to prevent protests in support of the country’s police.
The protest went ahead but was forced to go another way.
Narcissus Termes, a 68-year-old electrician, took part in the separation protests with his wife and said he was no longer hopeful that Catalonia would gain independence.
“Last year we had some of our best moments.
“I saw my parents crying with joy about being able to have a party, but now we’re stuck,” he said.
Despite having achieved the necessary but few victories in the regional elections in December last year, the Catalan independence movement has found it difficult to keep up this year, as many of its best-known leaders are either in self-imposed exile or in detention.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who picked up the protest in support of the police on his phone, said politicians from both counties had encouraged the dispute.
“The tension is growing,” he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been jailed and asked to be tried since late last year, announced that he would present himself to the European Parliament next year.
“My proposal in the European elections is the best way to condemn the retrogression in the field of democratic values and the repression that we have seen the Spanish government apply,” he said.
Londonderry: Man arrested after car was driven to house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after driving repeatedly to a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at 7:30 p.m.
Bob Blemmings, a research associate, said the gate and the building itself had been damaged.
It is also possible that the shot was fired from a crossbow in the direction of the vehicle.
Many scores in 1-0 victory Livingston against Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal secures Livingston
Livingston, who came from the lower division, came on the open shield and Steven Gerrard had to endure his second loss in 18 games as the manager of the Ibrox team.
Mark Dolly Menga made the fortune and Gary Holt's team is now in second place with Hibernian.
Team Gerrard has not yet won the outfield in this season's competition and play against Hearts, who are eight points ahead of in the top position, next Sunday.
For that game, the Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the European division on Thursday.
At the same time, Livingston is still undefeated in the division with six wins, and Holt's head coach has yet to experience a loss since he replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston smooths out opportunities for bitless guests
Holt's team should have been over long before it scored, but their shooting caused the Rangers a lot of trouble.
Scott Robinson managed to break through but hesitated in his attempt to score, and Alan Lithgow then shot past after slipping through the defense to take a shell pass from Graig Halkett across the goal.
The hosts let the Rangers play in front of them in calm, knowing that they could cause the guests problems in the right places.
And that was how the important goal was scored.
The Rangers won the extras and Livingston worked to create market opportunities. Declan Gallagher and Robinson helped Menga in a merger, which took delivery and scored from the midfield.
At that stage, the Rangers had managed the ball but the defense of the home team was unbreakable and Liam Kelly, the goalkeeper did not have to put much effort on himself.
This continued into the second half, though Alfredo Morelos managed to defend from Kelly.
Scott Pitman was stopped by Allan McGregor, Rangers goaltender, and Lithgow shot from goal at the request of Livingston.
The questions continued to flow into Livingston's baton, but were dismissed, and two demands for a baton - after Halkett's defense against alternate Glenn Middleton, and one behind - were dismissed.
"Wonderful" at Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont, BBC Scotland reporter at Tony Macaroni Stadium
Brilliant performance and finish for Livingston.
For a normal person, they stood out perfectly and continued to live up to all the expectations of their upbringing.
Their playing style and teams have hardly changed since they returned to the top division, but Holt deserves much praise for having pushed the team together since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Halkett, the chairman, was incredibly good and led the defense, while Menga held Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the toes all the time.
Rangers, on the other hand, lacked inspiration.
As good as they have been under Gerrard’s rule, they played far below expectations.
They went badly to finish their socks and only once managed to open the home half so this should be a wake-up call for the Rangers who are now in the middle of the division.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an receives mixed receptions in Cologne
There was a smile and a bright sky on Saturday (September 29th), when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met over breakfast in Berlin.
This is the last day of Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, which aims to improve relations between the two NATO nations.
Disputes have arisen between them over issues such as human rights, media freedom and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new, huge mosque.
The city is home to most of the Turkish population outside of Turkey itself.
The police used security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but a large number of supporters came to its vicinity to see its president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan – many of them Kurds – also heard and condemned both Erdogan’s policy and the decision of the German government to invite him to the country.
The two protest groups reflect how controversial this guest is, but he is hailed as a hero by some Turks in Germany and hated as a dictator by others.
Deptford crash: Cyclists killed in car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The crash occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, which is a number of streets in Deptford, in the southeastern part of the city, at about 10.15 a.m. local time.
The driver of the car stopped and the hospital staff gave an ambulance, but the man died in an accident.
The crash came a few months after another cyclist died in a crash in which the driver drove off on Childers Street, 1.5 km from Saturday's crash site.
The police said she was working to identify the man and let his closest relatives know.
Road closures and other direct bus trips have been made and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six inmates injured in riots
Six prisoners were injured when riots broke out in the men's safety prison, according to a report from the prison's detention center.
The riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at 9:30 a.m. local time on Sunday and are still raging.
"Tornado" special forces have been called to the area to try to stop the riots, which eight prisoners are indicted, and are only in one arm of the prison.
The guards were treated for minor injuries to the face on the scene.
A spokesman for the prison agency said: “Trained prisoners have been called out to deal with incidents that occur in Long Lartin Prison.
Six people have been injured in the accident.
There has been no violence in our prisons, and we make it clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and that they can expect to spend even more time behind bars and beatings."
More than 500 prisoners sit in Long Lartin prison, including some of the country’s most dangerous criminals.
In June, it was reported that the warden had to go to the hospital after a prisoner attacked him.
And in October of last year, riot police were called to the scene to deal with a serious disruption to peace, in which employees were attacked with billiard balls.
The Rose Valley threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with flash floods (a drying area could benefit)
It’s rare for the heatwave to hit Arizona, but it’s likely to happen early next week when the remnants of the R<0xC3><0xB3>sa basin hit the southwest, with the risk of flash floods.
The country’s weather agency has already issued warnings of flash floods for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and western Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
R<0xC3><0xB3>sa is expected to head straight across Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive late Monday with an outing.
The Phoenix Weather Bureau said on Twitter that only “ten hurricanes have managed to maintain strength to be classified as heat storms or lows at a distance of less than 320 km from Phoenix since the 1950s!
Katrina (1967) was a mountain range less than 40 miles (64 km) from the Arizona border.
The latest forecasts from the country's fallout center predict a 5-10 cm dropout, with a single dropout of up to 15 cm in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
It is likely to occur in 2.5 to 5 cm in other areas of the southwest, including the central part of the Rocky Mountains and The Great Basin, with the possibility of individual occurrences up to 10 cm.
For those who are not in danger of a flash flood, the outcome of the Rosu disaster could be a blessing because there are great droughts in the area.
Although flooding can cause a lot of damage, some of these occurrences will have a positive effect, since drought is now in the southwest.
According to U.S. drought control, at least a very large drought is in over 40 percent of Arizona, which is the second-highest category," according to weather.com.
First, the giant rose will land on the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
R<0xC3><0xB3>sa was still classified as a volcano on Sunday morning with a maximum wind strength of 136 km per hour and is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and travels north at a speed of 19 km per hour.
The storm passes over a cooler sea in the Pacific Ocean and its power diminishes.
It is therefore expected to arrive in Mexico as a heatwave late on Monday or Monday evening.
There is a high risk of flooding in some areas of Mexico, with a significant risk of flooding.
"An outbreak of up to 7.5 to 15 cm is expected in Baja California and into northwestern Sonora, with a potential of up to 25 cm," the weather.com said in a statement.
Rosa will then continue north across Mexico, as a heat storm, and then reach the Arizona border early on Tuesday morning as a heat wave. She will then continue up through Arizona and arrive in southern Utah late on Tuesday evening.
“The main threat that is expected to be posed by the remains of Rosa is a very large outbreak in Baja California, the northwestern Sonora region and the southwestern desert region of the United States,” the U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement.
These outbreaks are expected to cause life-threatening flash floods and movement of soil in the deserts, and to occur in the mountains.
The Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrests for Murder Attempts
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder, after a 16-year-old boy was found with a knife wound in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at around 4 a.m. local time on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where his condition is said to be "permanent".
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, according to police from Avon and Somerset.
The police have asked for a witness who could have a phone record of what happened.
Trump says Kavanaugh “had to find out about the evil and anger” of the Democratic Party
“Voting in support of Kavanaugh is a vote that rejects the ruthless and defamatory methods of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a meeting with supporters in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh "had to feel the evil and anger" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before the House on Thursday, in which he strongly denied allegations by Christine Blasey Ford that he sexually harassed her decades ago when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified before the committee about his allegations.
The president said Saturday that "the United States had seen the genius and the humanity and the courage" of Kavanaugh the day before.
“A vote to confirm a Kavanaugh judge is a vote to confirm one of the smartest lawyers of our time, a lawyer with a splendid career record as an official,” he told a group of supporters in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters taking part in the mid-term elections.
“It’s five weeks into one of the most important elections of our lives.
“I’m not going to do it, but I’m really going to do it,” he said.
“That’s why I’m going to go out there and fight for great candidates.”
Trump insisted the Democrats were working to “toughen and hinder.”
The first key vote on the floor of the Senate on Kavanaugh’s nomination will take place no later than Friday, according to an aide to the leaders of the republics in an interview with CNN.
Hundreds of people have been killed in Indonesia’s earthquake and tsunami, and the death toll is likely to rise.
At least 384 people have died and many have been washed away by a massive storm on the beaches, when a large earthquake and tsunami swept over the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when up to six meters high waves washed up on the beach at sunset, washed out many people in the sea and destroyed everything that happened to them.
The quake was caused by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake on the Richter River.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people were still on the beach and did not flee immediately, so it killed them,” Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for Indonesia’s anti-terror agency, told an intelligence meeting in Jakarta.
“The tsunami did not come alone, it brought with it cars, trees, houses, it will cover everything that was on land,” Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled over the open sea at 800 kilometers before it hit the beach.
Some climbed a tree to escape the flood and survived, he said.
Approximately 16,700 people were transferred to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs, published by the agency, showed many destroyed buildings and shops, turned and unused bridges and mosques surrounded by water.
The quakes continued to rage across the city on Saturday.
A series of earthquakes occurred in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's food and technology agency said in a statement that the energy released by the earthquake on Friday had been about 200 times that of the atomic bomb that fell on the city of Hiroshima in World War II.
The city’s geographical location, which lies at the end of a long and mild flood, could have increased the size of the flood wave, the agency said.
Nugroho said the damage was "significant" and that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of some victims were found trapped under a rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said the loss of life and property could be greater along the coastline 300 km north of Palu in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the source of the earthquake.
Communications "are completely down and no information is being received" from Donggala, Nugroho said.
"Over 300,000 people live there," the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
"It's already become a tragedy, but it could get much worse," the Red Cross said.
The organization was criticized by many on Saturday for not letting out the news that a flash flood had hit Palu, though officials said the storms had come within the time of the warning.
In a video posted on social media, one could hear screams from the top floor of a building to warn people on the street below that a tsunami was approaching.
Just a few minutes later, the wave on the beach breaks and takes away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not confirm the video immediately.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a power outage that impeded communication around Palu and made it difficult for authorities to plan relief work.
The army is beginning to send planes with relief products from Jakarta and other cities, according to the authorities, but people who have been helped by the area still need to hold on to food and other necessities.
The city's airport has only been reopened for relief operations and will be closed until October.
Joko Widodo, the president is going to visit the refugee centers in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll rises to more than 800 after a tsunami in Indonesia.
The situation is very bad.
World Vision staff from Donggala have reached the city of Palu, where they are looking for shelter in the tent cities that were set up in the garden outside their offices. Preparation blasted them along the way, according to Mr. Doseba.
“People said they’d seen a lot of houses being built,” he said.
The situation is very bad.
Aid groups have started difficult relief efforts, but some have complained that foreign aid workers with a great deal of expertise would be prevented from travelling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only start to arrive if the accident site is declared a disaster site.
It hasn't been done yet.
“This is still a local accident area,” said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
Once the government has declared that this is a buffer zone, we can open up to foreign aid, but no statement has been made yet."
When another night fell over Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and families of those still missing were holding on to the hope that their loved ones would be one of the miracles that cast hope on the devastating events that followed.
On Saturday, a young boy was rescued from a rut.
On Sunday, rescue workers rescued a woman who had been trapped under rubble for two days with her mother’s body by her side.
Gendon Subandono, the head coach of the Indonesian Air Force, had been the head coach of two missing men for the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others who locked themselves inside the Roa Roa hotel were his students, including Mr. Mandagi.
“As a man with a long experience in flying, I have my own emotional burden to bear,” he said.
Mr. Gendon said that hours after news broke that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed, he had sent WhatsApp messages in desperation to the contestants who stayed in Palu and took part in the beach festival.
His message, however, showed only a gray sign, instead of a blue one.
“I think that means that the message was not received,” he said.
Thieves steal 26,750 dollars at Newport on the Levee expressway
On Friday morning, thieves stole 26,750 dollars from an employee of Brink, who was filling a high-speed bank in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport police.
The driver of the car had been evacuating ATMs in the entertainment area and was about to make more money on him, Dennis McCarthy, a police officer, said in the statement.
While he was at work, another man came running after the Brink employee and stole a wallet intended for delivery.
Witnesses saw many suspected escapes from the scene, according to the statement, but police did not specify how many were the defendants in the case.
Those who may have information about the suspect are asked to contact the Newport Police Department on 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West wants to change his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Twitter on Saturday, writing, “The one that was previously known as Kanye West.”
West, 41, has been called Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album that came out in June.
The change comes before his appearance in the Saturday Night Live episode where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He replaces Ari<0xC3><0xB6>na Grandi in the episode, but she quit for “emotional reasons,” the show’s producer said.
West has previously said that this name has religious meaning for him, but it is also an abbreviation of his current name.
“I think ‘ye’ (you) is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means ‘you,’” West said earlier in the year when he spoke the name on his record to radio host Big Boy.
“So I am you, I am us, this is us.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye - to be just a reflection of the good in us, the bad, the messy, everything.
It’s a reflection of who we are.”
He is one of many famous rappers who have changed his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he would rather be called Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, a former West collaborator, has also written his name both with and without a ribbon and capital.
Mexico’s President-elect says he won’t use military force against civilians
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the president-elect of Mexico, has vowed never to use military force against ordinary citizens, now the silence of the country will soon commemorate the 50th anniversary of bloody revenge for students.
On Saturday in Tlatelolco Square, Lopez Obrador vowed to “never use the military to torture the Mexican people.”
Soldiers fired on a peaceful protest march in the square on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when left-wing student movements were rampaging across Roman America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to help young people in Mexico by giving all students a monthly grant and opening more free public universities.
He has said that unemployment and the lack of educational opportunities make young people criminal.
The U.S. should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
Now that China is increasingly active in the use of artificial intelligence, the United States should double its funding for research in that area, says inventor and artificial intelligence user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments were made after various branches of the U.S. government issued notifications of artificial intelligence, even though the U.S. does not have a formal comprehensive program of artificial intelligence.
China, on the other hand, announced its plan last year: it aims to be in the first place in innovation with artificial intelligence by 2030.
“It would be a good start to double the amount of funding that goes into artificial intelligence research, given that all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we’re looking forward to seeing the next big discovery in the field of artificial intelligence,” Lee said.
A doubling of funding could double the chances of the next major discovery in artificial intelligence being made in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, the author of the book “AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” published this month by publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of the largest artificial intelligence companies in the world.
He worked on the artificial intelligence system in the 1990s at Carnegie Mellon University, which won the U.S. best player at Othello, and later became a director of Microsoft Research and president of the Chinese division at Google.
Lee spoke of former technical teams held by the U.S. authorities, such as the Department of Defense's robotics competition, and asked when the next competition would be held, to spot the next entrepreneurs.
Scientists in the U.S. often need to put a lot of effort into getting government support, Lee said.
“It’s not China that appeals to its core idea, it’s the company,” Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been advising their university geniuses to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could also help the U.S. strengthen its intelligence-gathering efforts.
“I think those who have a PhD in artificial intelligence should get a residence permit automatically,” he said.
China’s parliament released its future intelligence plan in July 2017.
The China Institute of Natural Sciences provides funds to people working at the university institutions, similar to the National Science Foundation and similar public institutions do in the United States, but the quality of scientific work is worse in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense set up an artificial intelligence center, which is intended to cooperate with both industry and educational institutions, and the White House announced the formation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it had invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As far as NSF is concerned, it invests over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
At the same time, US legislation, which was intended to create a security council on artificial intelligence, has not been able to continue for many months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the country's name
The people of Macedonia abstained in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to the "Republic of North Macedonia" in an attempt to resolve decades-long dispute with Greece, which has blocked their application to join the European Union.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and maintains that the name of their neighbours in the north equals the claim on their territory and therefore denies them entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change will undermine the self-image of the majority of Macedonians of Slavic origin.
Gjorge Ivanov, the president, has said he will not participate in the vote and a campaign to ignore her has raised doubts that participation will reach the 50 percent minimum required for the vote to be considered valid.
The question of the referendum is as follows: “Would you like to join NATO and the EU by agreeing to an agreement with Greece?”
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say this is a fair fee for Macedonia to join alliances such as the EU and NATO, but the country is one of those that were formed after the fall of Yugoslavia.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country for the young people of Macedonia so that it can live freely under the protection of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us," said 79-year-old Olivera Georgievska in Skopje.
Although the result is not legally binding, enough senators have said they will follow it and bind it into law.
The name change would require the approval of two-thirds of the House.
The committee said it had not been notified of anything unusual at 1 a.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last general election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their votes.
“I came to vote for my children, our place is in Europe,” said Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dushko paid their vote in the referendum in Macedonia on whether to change the name of the country, but it would pay its way into NATO and the European Union, in September 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov worked to prepare a small field and set up chairs in front of a table that had been erected by those who will ignore the vote.
“We are leaning towards NATO and the EU, but we want to become members with our heads held high, not go through the service gates,” Kavardarkov said.
“We are a poor country, but we live in dignity.
If they don’t want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to China or Russia and become part of the Eurasian Union.”
Zaev's prime minister says NATO's membership will bring the necessary funds to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is above 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority of the majority will agree that over 80 percent of the country's citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO," Zaev said after paying his vote.
He said the approval would be “confirmation of our future.”
An opinion poll published on Monday by the Macedonian Research Foundation showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would take part in the referendum, which is lower than the minimum required.
A second poll by Telma TV showed that 57 percent of respondents planned to pay their votes on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would say yes.
In order for the referendum to be valid, the turnout must be 50 percent plus one vote.
If the vote is not passed, it could mean the first serious blow to the government’s policy, which is being blamed on the West, since it took effect in May last year.
See: Sergio Aguero, Manchester City player, goes through all the defense of Brighton and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling went easy with Brighton's defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy when he scored his goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian frontman received a shipment in the middle of the field at the beginning of the search.
He jumped past the three defenders of Brighton and then went out onto the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green-clad defenders.
He came across one defender and then ran ahead of a few in addition right to the welcome of Brighton.
Then he sent it to the left and found Sterling there.
The English forward used the first touch within the bat to send the ball back to Aguero, who used his right foot to play Mathew Ryan, Brighton goalkeeper, with a shot in the right side of the goal.
“Aguero is in some kind of foot trouble,” Pep Guardiola, the City’s executive director, told reporters.
“We talked about him playing 55, 60 minutes.
Then it happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at this point.”
But it was Sterling who gave them the blue first goal in the national team game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero received a shipment far inland from Brighton in that search.
He sent a long ball to Leroy Sane's left.
Sane kicked the ball several times and then sent Sterling towards the pole.
Forwardji City sent the ball to the net just before he ran out.
City play against Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12.55 p.m. on Tuesday at the Rhein-Necker Stadium in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a knockout game against the Rockies
Since the Nationals team has been excluded from playing in the finals, there was little reason to force another start.
But the competitive Scherzer hopes to get to pitch on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies still have a chance to reach the final, but they have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Division.
The Rockies won at least a wildcard seat with their 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but the team is still looking to reach their first league title.
“Even if we play for free, we can at least play for the electric atmosphere in Denver as well as meet the team definitely after playing their best game this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to compete in such a situation?”
The Nationals are yet to announce who will be the first pitcher in Sunday's game, but are expected to let Scherzer pitch in these circumstances.
Scherzer, who would start the game for the 34th time, took a practice run on Thursday and would throw on Sunday, which is his usual day off.
This rightful pitcher at Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 gusts in 220 2/3 runs this season.
Trump Visits West Virginia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
The president indirectly referred to the case around Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Justice, when he spoke about the importance of Republican supporters taking part in the midterm elections.
“It’s all in November.
It's five weeks into one of the most important elections of our lives.
These are one of those big, big... I don’t offer myself, but if I do, that’s why I’m going around the wide field to fight for great candidates,” he said.
Trump went on to say, “You see this horribly radical group of Democrats, you can see it happening now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means necessary, you see the cruelty, the malice.
They don’t care who they hurt, over whom they have to go to gain power and control, they just want to get power and control, we don’t give them that.
He said the Democrats were working to “toughen and hinder.”
“And it’s been seen the last four days,” he said, telling Democrats to be “angry and evil and ugly and untrue.”
He named Dianne Feinstein, a senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and was answered with a loud holler from the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?”
Was it you who wrote the book?
Ha, what.
No, look no. I waited for one... it was really bad physical appearance, the worst I've ever seen."
The working class is no longer the governing body of the Church.
He does not tolerate those who speak his mind.
When the action Momentum in my class coughed to give me a compliment, it hardly came as a surprise.
I am, after all, the last of the many members of the working class who have been told that we are not welcome, just for expressing our minds.
Joan ryan, my colleague, received similar treatment because she strongly objected to prejudices against Jews.
In my case, the suggestion to give me a recommendation came about because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The issues were important to have a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, a matter that was eloquently similar and Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of the meeting for Nottingham East on Friday said that "we want the meetings to understand no outsiders and to be successful."
In my eight-year career as a member of the Labour Party, Friday’s meetings have often been just that.
Unfortunately, that is not the tone of many meetings today, and the promise of “softer and better” politics has been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not shared within the Labour Party and that all views are judged on the basis of whether the leaders of the party consider them acceptable.
This began shortly after Jeremy became a leader, when colleagues, who I thought had similar political views to myself, began to expect me to take a total turn and support views that I had never previously agreed with, whether it was about national security or the EU’s national security agenda.
Every time I speak out publicly - and then little does matter what I say - it follows the scathing demeanor of social media where it is called after my breakup, central government issues are denied and I am told that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
I know I’m luckier than some of my co-workers, as most of the comments I get to me are mostly political.
I admire the professionalism and affirmation of those who have to endure the holocaust of sexual or prejudiced abuse on a daily basis but never quit.
One of the biggest disappointments of this political period is how attacks and insults have become a normal part of everyday life.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should be leaning towards a more tolerant culture.
The reality is that we are no longer a conservative church, and with each no-confidence motion or change in the electoral rules, the class will be increasingly divided.
I’ve been getting a lot of advice in the last two years to let myself be carried away, not have too much and then “all right” would be with me.
But I didn’t choose to participate in politics to do so.
Ever since I became a member of the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, inspired by the negligence of the Thatcher government that left my schoolroom in disrepair, I have fought for better public service for those who need it most, whether I was in the city government or on it.
I have never hidden my political views, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be in any doubt about my policy views and where I disagree with current leaders.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I just want to say that when the country embarks on Brexit, which will harm our homes, businesses and public services, I do not understand the desire to spend time and energy in my devotion to the leaders of the Working Group.
But my only message, which I want to send, is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to those within my constituency, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I serve you with pride and I promise that no threat of deviation or political repression will deter me from doing so.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated team Ayr goes to the top
Two late touchdowns could have shocked the final score somewhat, but there’s no doubt that Ayr had the win in this quick game of the day in Tennent’s Premiership division.
They are now at the top of the list and the only team out of ten that is still undefeated.
In the end, it was their stronger defense and better use of the opportunities that made homers a winner and Peter Murchie coach had every right to be happy.
“We’ve had a tough opposition in our games so far and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said, "Ayr deserves praise, they took their chances better than we did,"
Mark Grant Anderson came over to Ayr 14 minutes after Frazier Climo turned the call on, but a yellow card on the Scottish front, which was allowed to play the game with the Warriors, allowed Melrose to let the numbers speak and Jason Baggot managed to score a touchdown.
Climo advanced to lead Ayr with a wit before scoring with a kick just before halftime and then touchdown and Ayr came over 17-5 in the half.
But Melrose started the second half of the power and Patrick Anderson's touch, after Baggot turned the sock over, reduced the mark to five points.
Dora then had to take a long break to deal with serious injuries to Ruaridh Knott, who had to be carried off the pitch, and after that Ayr still increased his lead with a touchdown from Stafford McDowall, after Climo turned the ball around.
Blair Macpherson, the chairman of Ayr, then received the yellow card and Melrose again used to be a man over with a touch mark from Bruce Colvine, at the end of the hard-fought.
However, the homers came back strong and when Struan Hutchinson was given the yellow card for having knocked Climo without a bolt, MacPherson scored a touchdown behind Ayr's back, after the extra kick.
Climo turned the ball around, as he did again shortly after the restart, after Kyle Rowe scored David Amrstrong's kick from the bat and sent to Gregor Henry who scored the team's fifth touchdown.
Star Still Game episodes ready for a new career in the restaurant industry
Ford Kieran, the star of the Still Game episodes, seems ready to move on to the restaurant scene after it emerged that he had been hired as the director of a restaurant company.
Kieran, 56, plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC shows, which he writes and plays in the company of his old friends from the entertainment industry, Creg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be their last and it seems that Kiernan has plans for Craiglang's lifestyle.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Adriftmorn Limited.
The player wanted nothing to say about the news, but a Scottish Sun source claimed that Kiernan wanted to become a participant in the "living restaurant industry" of Glasgow city.
“The sea is ours”: the beachless country of Bolivia hopes that a court will reopen the way to the Pacific
Marines guard the fleet's headquarters in La Paz.
General buildings flag blue flag.
Fleet stations from Titicaca to the Amazon River are marked with the slogan: “We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to restore it."
On the other hand, throughout the landlocked Bolivia, the memory of the coastline lost to Chile in bloody battles in the 19th century is still fresh in memory - along with the desire to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes are perhaps the strongest in decades, now that Bolivia is awaiting a verdict from the International Court of Justice in The Hague on October 1 after five years of speeches.
“Bolivia is living above the power, the spirit of unity and the powerlessness, and, of course, is waiting for the verdict with a positive mind,” said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will follow the ruling of the International Court of Justice on large screens all over the country, in the hope that the court in The Hague will rule on Bolivia in favor of their demand that Chile be obliged to grant Bolivia access to the sea, after many decades.
Monday’s ruling is also very important for Evo Morales, the country’s president of Indian assets who will face a tough fight for re-election next year.
“We are very close to returning to the Pacific,” he promised in late August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court ruled in Bolivia’s favor, and that it would make little difference if it did.
The court, which has its headquarters in the Netherlands, has no power to give land from S<0xC3><0xAD>le and has provided that the ruling will not affect the outcome of any possible hearings.
The fact that the court’s ruling comes just six months after the hearing indicates that the case “would not have been complicated,” said Paz S<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
It is also possible that the last four years have not been a matter for Bolivia to move forward, but have caused the country to retreat.
“The current government of Bolivia has stolen the issue of access to the sea,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate said.
Morales’s powerful speech has cut off all goodwill from S<0xC3><0xAD>le, she said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue negotiations sometime, but it will be extremely difficult after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, former President of Bolivia and representative of the country in The Hague, rejected the idea that the decision of the court had taken an unusually short time.
On Monday, Bolivia will have "a unique opportunity to open up a new relationship with Chile" and an opportunity to "end a dispute that reaches 139 years back in time, for the benefit of both countries," he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, who is still one of the most popular presidents in Roman America, was using this issue as a political rally.
“Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific,” he added.
“The decision is an opportunity to see that we need to balance the past.”
North Korea says it will not develop nuclear weapons unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea’s foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says the country will never take down its nuclear weapons unless it can trust Washington.
Ri delivered his speech on Saturday at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to follow through on the promises it made at a meeting in Singapore between the leaders of the nations.
His remarks now come as U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to be resuming talks on nuclear weapons, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with Kim Jong Un, the leader of North Korea.
Ri says it is "dreaming" that a continuing trade ban and U.S. protests against a declaration of the end of the Korean War will eventually take over North Korea.
Washington does not want to accept the statement unless Pyongyang first takes clear action to take down its nuclear weapons.
Both Kim and Donald Trump, the president of the United States, will meet again at another meeting.
However, there is considerable doubt that Pyongyang is serious about taking down weapons that the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next meeting between Kim and Trump.
Fashion shows in Paris present the latest line of large headwear that will come in fashion stores near you
If you want to expand your hat collection or be completely hidden from the sun, you don’t need to look any further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne displayed a variety of oversized hats for their SS19 line on the fashion scene that captivated the crowd at Paris Fashion Week.
A number of images of extremely unapproachable hats have been posted on Instagram this summer and these designers have had their innovative creations showcased at fashion shows.
Valentino's main work was a large light brown hat with wide beards that resembled feathers and covered the head of the models.
Of the other accessories in the oversize, watermelons could be seen put gemstones, silkworm hats and even pineapples, but these items are not designed to keep heat on the head.
Thom Browne also introduced many kinds of strange masks, precisely at the right time before the massacre.
Many of the colorful masks were of combined colors and resembled Hannibal Lecter rather than the Haitian one.
One cream resembled a dipping device with a breathing tube and glasses, while the other resembled melting ice in bread form.
If you want to get into fashion, luck is with you.
Fashion experts predict that the big hats could soon be on sale in the fashion stores near you.
Large hats come in a dose on the heel of the “La Bomba”, a straight hat with over 60cm large beards that has graced the head from Rih<0xC3><0xB6>nn to Emily Ratajkowski.
The fashion label on the back of the extremely inconvenient hat, which was seen on all social media, was inspired by another large accessory that appeared on the fashion scene – a straw beach bag that was almost the same size as the swimsuit model that wore it.
The orange square, with a large chest and a white leather handle, was the main part of the La Riviera SS10 fashion line Jacquemus at the Paris Fashion Week.
Luke Armitage, a celebrity stylist, said in an interview with FEMAIL: “I expect to see big hats and beach bags pop up in the fashion stores next summer – as the designer has had such a huge impact it should be hard to ignore the demand for accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
The private schools in Scotland are known for their students’ outstanding achievements and it has continued into 2018 with new, elegant test results, which are still reinforced by individual and group achievements in sports, arts, music and other societies.
These schools have up to 30,000 students across Scotland, with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) in charge of them, and they compete to provide their students and their parents with the best possible service.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for further study, the career they have chosen and their status as a global citizen.
As a teacher who can put together and teach according to specialized curricula, we see that youth continue to be a popular subject of study in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a man in a language he understands, it touches his mind.
If you talk to him in his native language, it touches his heart.”
This is an important reminder that we can’t just rely on English to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
This year’s test results show us that languages are at the top of the list with the highest rates of students taking exams in private schools.
68 percent of students who learned a foreign language received the A score.
The data, collected from 74 schools within the SCIS, showed that 72 percent of students received an A grade in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who learned German, 69 percent of those who learned French, and 63 percent of those who learned Spanish also received an A grade.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages that the necessary skills that children and young people will certainly need to hold in the future.
At the moment, languages, such as electives, are placed in the same place as scientific subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curricula of private schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that, for the reasons that employers found it difficult to get a job, there was a 17 per cent shortage of people with language skills.
That is why language skills are becoming increasingly important in preparing young people for their future jobs.
Now that more and more jobs require proficiency in languages, this skill is essential in a nationalized world.
No matter what career path people choose, it will have a real head start in the future if they learn another language, but it is a skill that will last a lifetime.
Being able to have direct communication with people from other countries will automatically give a multi-talented person an advantage over the competitor.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov on over 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent of them could not speak another language well enough to hold talks, and French was the only language spoken by two-digit percentages, or 15 percent.
That is why it is important for today’s children to invest immediately in language learning.
Multilingualism, especially in new-market countries, will give children a better chance of finding a meaningful job.
In Scotland, it is different between schools what language they teach.
A certain number of schools will focus on classic new languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be most important to the UK when viewed until 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter where your child’s interest lies, they will always be able to choose from languages in private schools with specialized teachers.
Scottish private schools are committed to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It cannot be denied that at this time, in a global business environment, language continues to be necessary for the future of the country, and it must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern language should really be seen as “the international skill in communication.”
Private schools will continue to offer a choice, diversity and superiority for Scotland’s young people.
It has to be done.
John Edwards is the chairman of the Scottish Council of Private Schools.
LeBron plays his first game for the Lakers in San Diego on Sunday
The wait is soon over for fans who want to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play Sunday in the opening game of the season against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
It has not yet been determined how many minutes he will play.
“It’s going to be longer than one minute and shorter than 48,” Walton said on the Lakers’ official website.
Mike Trudell, a reporter for the Lakers, said on Twitter that James would likely play for a limited time.
Following practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for a six-game schedule for the Lakers before the start of the season.
“At this point in my career, I don’t have to play games for the playoff season to prepare,” he said.
Timings for Trump’s election campaign in West Virginia and YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will hold a number of elections and the first one is tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
He is one of five scheduled meetings next week, where he will also stop at friendly venues, including in Tennessee and Mississippi.
Now that the vote to confirm his election to the new Supreme Court has been put on hold, Trump aims to build support for the next mid-term elections, because the republics are in danger of losing control of the parliament when the votes are paid in November.
What time is the Trump election in West Virginia, and how can you watch it online?
Trump’s meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is set to begin at 7 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the meeting with Trump in West Virginia online below via live broadcast on YouTube.
Trump is likely to address the trial of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s nominee, where tensions reign over allegations of sexual harassment. The Senate’s vote to confirm him as a judge was put on hold for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main goal of the Trump meetings is to help the republics achieve better progress, but they are waiting for a difficult election in November.
Therefore, the message from Trump’s election campaign was that these five meetings, which will be held next week, aim to “fill volunteers and supporters with fervor as Republicans try to protect and increase the majority that they have in the Senate and the Senate.”
"The control of the House is so essential to the president's plan that he will travel to as many counties as can already be as soon as the campaign season is about to begin," an unnamed Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
The meeting tonight will be held at the Wesbanco Stadium in Wheeling and supporters are expected to come from “Ohio and Pennsylvania and the media from Pittsburgh will tell about it,” according to the West Virginia Metro News.
The meeting on Saturday will be Trump’s second visit to West Virginia this month, but he won by over 40 percent in this state in 2016.
Trump wants to try to help Patrick Morrissey, the Republican candidate in West Virginia for the Senate, but he is at the bottom of the polls.
“It is not good for Morrissey that the president needs to come and try to increase his popularity,” Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia, told Reuters.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. team shows willingness to fight to keep hope alive for the individual race on Sunday
After three one-sided rounds, the fourth game, which was late on Saturday, could be exactly what was needed in this race for the Ryder Cup.
Swings in Success is a sport concept that has been invented and that players so truly believe in, and never more than in competitions like this one.
Where would they say that success lies now?
“They were six points ahead and now it’s four points, so success is pretty much on our side right now, I expect,” Jordan Spieth said as he started the day’s race.
Europe is, of course, ahead, four levels ahead with twelve more in the hat.
The Americans, as Spieth said, consider themselves to have some wind in the sails and they can be disappointed by many, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day and where got three points out of four.
Spieth has played largely everything except the flat and leads by his example.
The cheers went up as soon as he made his way to the ring and he put down an important pit to guard all four levels of the game after he and Thomas had been two levels under after two games.
His pitcher, who guaranteed them victory in the game at 15th hole, received a similar cheering cry, a cry of the kind that tells one that he believes the American team has not yet won.
“You just have to dig deep and think about your own game,” Spieth said.
That’s the only thing these players can do right now.
18 holes to earn points.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinaro and Tommy Fleetwood, the indisputable story of the Ryder Cup.
This strange but poignant European couple has won four games out of four and can do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" were the only couple to receive schooling on Saturday afternoons, but they also managed to avoid schooling on Saturday mornings, Friday afternoons, and on the nine-hole field on Friday mornings.
That game and how their energy seems to flow both to and from the loud audience clearly shows that they are the pair that needs to win on Sunday, and there would be no popular player to seal the possible victory of the European team but Fleetwood or Molinari, the sun is sitting over the Le Golf National field.
The best option would be to do both at the same time in different holes.
However, it is still too early to talk about the victory of the European team.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson went easy with Sergio Garcia, the hero of the quartet in the morning, where he played with Alex Noren.
Skoll and two doubles in the first nine holes, the Spaniard and the Swede dug into a hole that they never managed to clear.
But on Sunday, no one can help you up out of your hole.
The quads and quads are so exciting to watch closely because of the communication between the couples, their advice, the advice they don’t give, and how the play plan can change in one go.
Europe has played better as a team so far and has a significant lead for the final day, but this quarter-final also showed that the U.S. team has the will to fight that some doubted it had, especially other Americans.
Europe with 10-6 lead for the final day of the race for the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a good lead for the final day of the Ryder Cup after the quarter-finals and the quarter-finals on Saturday, with a 10-6 lead against the United States.
Star duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the attack with two victories over Tiger Woods, who was in trouble, and have scored four points on the Le Golf National field.
European team Thomas Bjorns, who would like to regain the prize pool, which it lost on the Hazeltine field two years ago, showed great superiority over the American team in the morning quarterfinals and won 3-1.
The United States showed more opposition in the four games and won two games but failed to win the ladder.
Team Jim Furyks needed eight points from 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the cup going.
Fleetwood is the first European newcomer to win four points in a row and he and Molinari, who share the nickname "Molliwood" after a magnificent weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their first four games in the history of Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the four-ball game, they showed great team strength and defeated Woods and American newcomer Bryson Dechambeau 5–4.
Woods, who dragged himself through two games on Saturday, showed his genius on a number of occasions, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-ball and four-game games, including seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested for the morning quadrangle, returned to his teammate Henrik Stenson in the quadrangle and they won 2-1 against Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - who are in first and third place on the list of the best golfers in the world.
Europe, however, did not do all the work on this mild and gustasama day south-west of Paris.
A three-time winner in the golf majors, Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the goal for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2-1 against Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the quarterfinals and later came back and defeated Poulter and Rory Mcllroy 4-3 in the quarterfinals after losing the first two holes.
It has only happened twice in the history of the Ryder Cup that a team has won four stages at the start of an individual competition, although Furyk's team only needed a tie to keep the cup going.
Having been second best for two days, however, it seems that the data attack on Sunday will be overwhelming.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament ‘impossible’ without trust <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that the continued trade ban only hinges on their mistrust of the United States and it would be impossible for the country to bring down its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual U.N. General Assembly that North Korea had resorted to “several measures to demonstrate goodwill” in the past year, for example, by halting nuclear and missile tests, taking down nuclear tests and shutting down nuclear reactors, and shutting down nuclear reactors.
“However, we have not seen any corresponding response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally take down our nuclear weapons first.”
Although Ri has repeated well-known North Korean complaints about Washington’s opposition to a “step-by-step” approach to nuclear disarmament, where North Korea would be rewarded for every step it takes, his statement seemed special in that he did not reject a single-handed nuclear strike and a single-handed nuclear strike.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between a working U.S. president and a North Korean leader, in Singapore on June 12, where Kim called for working to “nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula” and Trump issued a pledge of security to North Korea.
North Korea has sought solutions to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must abandon its nuclear weapons first.
Washington has also resisted calls to relax a strict trade ban against North Korea.
“The United States is demanding that ‘nuclear disarmament take place first,’ and increasing the pressure by using a trade ban to achieve its objectives, and even objecting to the declaration of an end to the war,” Ri said.
“There are only dreamers of people who know nothing about us to think that a trade ban can get us on our knees.
But the problem is that continuing trade bans add to our mistrust.”
Ri did not mention plans for another meeting between Kim and Trump that the U.S. leader spoke about at the U.N. earlier this week.
Instead, the minister spoke about three meetings between Kim and Moon Jae-In, the leader of South Korea over the past five months, adding: “If the party to this nuclear weapons issue were South Korea instead of the United States, this would not be the case.
Despite this, the tone of Ri’s speech was very different last year when he told the U.N. General Assembly that it was inevitable to target rockets from North Korea to the U.S. mainland after “the devilish president” Trump called Kim “a coward.”
Last year, Trump threatened to “destroy” North Korea, but this year he vowed to praise Kim at the United Nations for his courage to take a step towards disarmament, but said there was still much work to be done and that a trade ban would continue until the North Koreans had a chance to do so.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this and said, “If it takes two years, three years, or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps it has taken.
Mike Pompeo, the U.S. Secretary of State at the U.N. Security Council, said on Thursday: "The Security Council's trade ban must continue until total nuclear disarmament has taken place and it has been confirmed."
The Security Council agreed to increase its trade ban with North Korea from 2006 in an attempt to close funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said the results had been achieved, but only hours later North Korea condemned him for making “criminal demands.”
North Korea vowed at a meeting with Moon this month to take down a rocket site and a nuclear power plant if the United States intervened to “consistently act.”
He said Kim had told himself that the “corresponding actions” he was looking for were security assurances Trump promised in Singapore and actions toward normal relations with Washington.
Students at Harvard take a course in sufficient rest
A new course at Harvard University has given all students more sleep in an effort to counter the growing tendency of students to wake up and study all night long with the help of caffeine pills.
A study found that students at the world’s best universities often know little or nothing when it comes to the basics of thinking about themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and the Women’s Hospital, designed the course and believes it to be the first of its kind in the United States.
He got the idea to do the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning ability.
“At the end of the lecture, a girl came to me and asked, ‘Why am I being told this now, in my last year?’
She said no one had told her anything about the importance of sleep, which surprised me," he told the Telegraph.
The course, which is held for the first time this year, explains to students the basics of how good sleep habits help learning and performance in sports and even contribute to general well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the school’s health services, said the university had decided to introduce the course after finding that students were extremely sleepy over the week.
The course is one hour in length and includes a variety of interactive activities.
In one part is a picture of a room on the doorstep, where students click on coffee cups, window sills, sneakers and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light and how performance in sports can worsen with lack of sleep, as well as the importance of a good routine for sleep.
In the second part, participants are told how a lack of sleep over the long term can increase the risk of heart attacks, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the school area with interactive symbols then encourages participants to think about their daily habits.
“We know that this will not change the behavior of students under the same.
But we feel that they have a right to know this, just as one has a right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
The culture that celebrates those who stay awake and study all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and the strain on students meant that sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough quality sleep should be a “secret weapon” for students to defend against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said — even to avoid dieting, because sleep deprivation increases the brain’s call for food so that the body is thirsty.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and physics student from California, helped Professor Czeisler put the course together, but he sat one of the professor’s courses last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to call for a course for all students in the school.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all master students to complete a similar course before they start their studies at the university.
Professor Czeisler suggested that students consider setting an alarm clock, which reminds them to go to sleep, and to wake them up, and keep in mind the harmful effects of blue light that electronic screens and LED lights give off, but it can confuse the inside of the body with a malfunction and lead to a malfunction.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Mark from Menga shoots down Gerrards men
The Rangers still had a hard time in the offseason when Stevens Gerrards' disbanded team had to settle for a 1-0 loss at Livingston, after a goal from Dolly Menga.
The Ibrox team wanted their first win in the opener after their victory at St Johnstone in February, but the Gary Holt team gave the Gerrards only their second loss in his 18 games as manager. The team is now eight points behind Hearts, who is in the top spot in the Ladbrokes Premiership division.
Menga scored seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers team seemed to lack all the inspiration and was never likely to settle.
The Rangers now fall to sixth place but Livingston climbs up to third and are only behind Hibernian in the margin.
Rangers could run into further trouble after lineman Calum Spence had to be indicted for head injury after some item was thrown at him from the visitors' basement.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that swept Ayr away and came to an exception in the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, stuck with the same Livi 11 setup that reached the level of Hearts last week and he would have been pleased with how well-trained his teammates overcame the challenge.
The Rangers may have had more with the ball, but Livingston created more chances with the balls it got.
They should have scored just two minutes after the start of the game when the first broadcast from Menga came Scott Pitman in front of Allan McGregor's mark, but he shot past.
Keaghan Jacobs's long extras then ended with Craig Halkett but Alan Lithgow, his defensive partner, shot past the pole.
The Rangers regained control of the game but appeared to live on hope rather than faith in their game in the final quarter of the game.
Alfredo Morales certainly felt that he should have been given the thumbs-up by the end of the quarter, when he and Steven Lawless were due together, but the judge Steven Thomson dismissed the Columbian man's appeal.
The Rangers only managed to take two shots to score in the first half, but Liam Kelly, former Ibrox goaltender, didn't have much to gain by defending the scalp from Lassana Coulibaly and an easy shot from Ovie Ejaria.
Although Livi’s 34th minute opportunity would have come despite the fact that the team had the upper hand, no one can deny that they deserved it, even if only because of their stubbornness.
The Rangers failed again to make anything out of Jacobs' long extras.
Scott Arfield failed when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his peace and chose to send it to Menga, who then scored easily.
Gerrard, meanwhile, took a half-game deal and sent Ryan Kent in instead of Coulibaly and the trades had an impact closer to the moment the rear guard arrived at Morelos, but Kelly rushed in quickly and ran to close the shot.
Livingston, however, continued to narrate the guests to play exactly the kind of game they enjoyed playing and Lithgow and Halkett each longed to catch up with each other.
Holt's team could have increased their lead in the final minutes, but McGregor stood well in denying Jacobs a chance before Lithgow ran away from the corner.
Glenn Middleton, a Rangers substitute, wanted another clue as he and Jacobs fell apart, but Thomson turned it down again.
Almanac: The Man Who Invented the Geiger Counter
Here is a page from our almanac "Sunday Morning": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and AFRAM... this is the day that the future scientist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method to detect and measure radioactivity and that invention eventually led to a device called a Geiger meter.
The Geiger meter has gained a permanent place in the scientific world since then but was also popular in pop culture, for example in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in unlikely roles as scientists:
Man: “What the hell is this?”
Rogers: “This is a Geiger meter, used to find radioactive materials such as uranium.
When you put this headset on you can hear the effect of the atoms due to the radiation activity in the stones."
Evans: “It really sucks now!”
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
A new anti-cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to ‘see’ dangerous cells
A new anti-cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to ‘see’ dangerous cells and kill them
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognise dangerous cells as part of the treatment.
The treatment involves taking immune cells from the patient and modifying them in a laboratory.
Then they can “see” the protein, which is common in many cancer cells, and is then injected back into the patient.
Vaccines at the experimental level have shown positive results in patients suffering from different types of cancer.
In one woman who received the vaccine, ovarian cancer disappeared for more than 18 months. The vaccine teaches immune cells to recognize dangerous cancer cells.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and modifying them in a laboratory so that they can “see” a protein called HER2 found in many types of cancer. The cells are then injected back into the patient.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. Cancer Institute in Bethesday, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that the vaccine is highly effective.”
HER2 “makes a variety of cancers stop growing,” including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers and rectal cancers, said Professor Berzofsky.
A similar method in which immune cells are removed from patients and they are “trained” to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a single type of leukaemia.
Kanye West held a long speech in support of Trump and wore a MAGA hat after appearing on the television show SNL.
It didn't end well
He was speaking at Kanye West's Saturday Night Live studio after a lengthy speech in which he praised President Donald Trump and said he would offer himself to the president in 2020.
After moving the third song of the evening, Ghost Town, where he wore the Make America Great hood, he spoke out against Democrats for a long time and reiterated his support for Trump.
“I’ve spoken so often to white people who say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I were worried about racial hatred, I would have been deported from the United States a long time ago,” he said.
SNL kicked off the show with a prank in which Hollywood star Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee over Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment.
Although the long-lost West had not been released, the recording of it was put on social media by the comedian Chris Rock.
It’s not certain if Rock wanted to make a joke about West by publishing the recording.
West had also complained to the audience that he had received poor receptions from the back because of his cap roll.
“I was put in a back seat.
They said to me, "Don't go up to the field with this hat."
They threw me in jail!
Then they say I'm in a deep hole," he said, according to news reports from the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the deep hole?” and said that he would put on his super hero costume “because that means you can’t order me to do things. Do you want the world to make progress?
“Try the love.”
His comments were greeted with a crowd of spectators at least twice and the SNL players seemed embarrassed, according to Variety, and one attendee told the paper: "There was a blizzard in the studio."
West had been invited to star in the show in place of singer Ari<0xC3><0xB6>na Grande, but her boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West surprised many with his stage performance when he sang the song I Love It, dressed like a bottle of Perrier.
West received support from Candace Turner, the president of the conservative TPUSA party, but she said on Twitter: “To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR SHOWING MOUTH RESISTANCE.”
But chat host Karen Hunter said on Twitter that West was simply being “himself and that’s absolutely wonderful.”
“But I chose not to reward someone (by buying his music or clothing or supporting his ‘art’) who I feel supports and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
“We are too,” she added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "the being that was formerly known as Kanye West."
He is not the first artist to change his name and footprints to Diddy, who is also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, has also called himself Snoop Lion and must not forget the musical legend Prince the Heath, which changed its name to a symbol and later called itself the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder after a knife attack on a restaurant in Belfast
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after being shot in a restaurant in eastern Belfast on Tuesday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The defendant is expected to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecutor will go over the charges.
Kit Harington, the star of the Crown Games, criticises toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent adventure series, The Crown Games.
However, the 31-year-old has criticized the stereotype of the male hero and says that such a role on the screen means that young boys often feel that they need to be tough to gain respect.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes “something has gone wrong” and wondered how to deal with the problem of toxic maleness in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his co-star from the Crown Games, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, admitted that he had “strong views” on how to deal with the issue.
“Personally, I think at the moment – what has gone wrong with masculinity?”
“What have we taught men in their upbringing about the problems we see now?”
Kit believes that the TV is partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity, due to the very masculine characters in the TV.
He continued: “What is conceived and what is taught?
What is taught on TV and on the streets that makes young boys feel like they have to be made by a man?
I think that’s one of the most important questions of the day – how do we change that?
Because it’s clear that something has gone wrong with young men.”
He also admitted in the interview that he would not play in any other Crown Princess series after the series looks like next summer and said that he had received "a lot of killings and horses."
Starting in November, Kit will play in a recreation of True West, a film by Sam Shepard, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother who is a thief.
The player recently said that the best thing about having played in the Crown Games was to have met his wife, Rose.
“I met my wife in these episodes, so they somehow gave me my future family and my life after that,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, Jon Snow's lover whom Kit played in these Emmy Award-winning episodes.
The couple married in June 2018, on the land of Lesliar's family in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new infections
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of people living with HIV who are infected with HIV or who are dying.
Health officials say more than 820,000 people are infected in the country.
About 40,000 new infections were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The vast majority of new infections are fought with sex, which is a change from what was before.
In the past, HIV spread rapidly in some parts of China due to the donation of infected blood.
The number of people infected with the HIV virus in this way has fallen back to almost zero, according to Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, the number of people infected by the HIV virus or its destruction has increased by 100,000 from year to year.
Sex-related HIV is a serious problem within the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality has not been illegal in China since 1997, but much discrimination against LGBT people is yet to take place.
Due to the prevalence of sexual intercourse in the country, studies have estimated that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men eventually marry a woman.
Many infections will be due to inadequate contraception in these marriages.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised access for all to HIV drugs as part of a plan to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that an employee leaked data from senior Republican congressmen, criticises “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories”
On Saturday, Maxine Waters, a congresswoman, denied the allegations that one of her employees had published personal information of three senior Republican congressmen on their Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat said the claims came from “superstitious” extremists and websites.
“Lies, lies and more horrible lies,” Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham from South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared online on Thursday from an unknown source on Capitol Hill while interrogations took place at the senior division of Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s nominee, over allegations of sexual harassment.
The leak came some time after the three high-ranking senators had overheard Kavanaugh.
Some conservatives, such as Gateway Pundit and RedState, said the IP numbers identifying the source of the information were related to Waters’ office and published information about one of its employees, according to information from Capitol Hill.
“This unsubstantiated allegation is absolutely wrong and a pure lie,” Waters continued.
“My employee – whose personal information and security are now at risk due to these wrong accusations – bore no responsibility whatsoever for this information leak.
This unprovoked accusation is utterly wrong and a pure lie."
Waters' statement was quickly criticized online, including by Ara Fleischer, the former White House press secretary.
“This denial is full of anger,” Fleischer wrote.
“It shows that she doesn’t have the capacity to sit in the Senate.
When someone is accused of for no reason, do not react with anger.
It cannot be opposed.
It is not necessary to ask the reasons for the accusation.
You have to be calm and considerate.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the criticism of Democrats at Kavanaugh judges, who critics said appeared to be too angry with the judiciary on Thursday.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate against Waters in the midterm elections, also said his opinion on Twitter.
“If it’s true,” he said.
In a statement, Waters said her office had made “the relevant authorities and law enforcement officials aware of these false claims.
“We will ensure that the culprits are found,” she continued, “and that they are held accountable for all those acts that are harmful and dangerous to all my employees.”
Movie review for Johnny English Strikes again - spy thriller with Rowan Atkinson proved to be a force
It has become a habit of the modern world to look for Brexit references in all the new pictures where Britain comes to a story, and that seems to apply in this revival of the Johnny English comedy series - which began in 2003 with the movie Johnny English and just woke up to life again in 2011 with the movie Johnny English.
Will this cantankerous satire about how clearly miserable we are to be a new export opportunity for the country?
Whether or not the outcast, rascal and sly Johnny English has been given renewed permission for a second time to frustrate everything - his name shows above all that he is a creative work designed for exhibition in countries other than English-speaking countries.
He is, of course, the witty secret serviceman who pretends to be living over gripping personal magic but is a bit of a mix of Clouseau, the dass of Mr. Bean and a bit of the man who played one note for the song Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
He is also originally based on the tourist and mysterious world-citizen Atkinson once played in the forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, where he divorced everything in disarray.
There is one or two good items in this latest Johnny English picture.
I enjoyed watching Johnny English walk around a helicopter wearing a medieval vest and the helicopter blades would be in his helmet.
Atkinson clearly shows his wits, but the humor seems rather powerless and strangely superficial, especially now that “serious” films like James Bond and the Mission Impossible films also offer an insatiable amount of jokes.
The joke seems more intended for children than adults, and I found the adventures that Johnny English found in not as imaginative and focused as Atkinson’s silent jokes in Mr. Bean’s fiction.
The real problem with this film is that the UK is in a lot of trouble.
A hacker has managed to break into Britain’s secret intelligence network and find out the identities of all British spies, much to the dismay of the spy on the watch – but that’s where Kevin Eldon unfortunately comes in for too small a role.
This is the final straw for the Prime Minister who is a proud and controversial person and already in great trouble due to enormous political disapproval: Emma Thompson does her best with her role as a character to be remembered by Theresa May, but the script is not up to many fish for hand.
Her advisers tell her that all active spies are in danger and that she must find someone who had already settled in a sacred stone.
And there Johnny English himself comes to the story, now the headmaster of some fine school, but also provides a secret lesson in how to be a scout: here are some funny jokes English offers a scout school reminiscent of the movie School of Rock.
English is called back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets there Bough, his former longtime partner, whom Ben Miller plays again.
Bough is now a married man, his wife is a submarine master, but in this energetic role, Vicki Pepperdine does not quite shine her light.
The nativity scene that fucks everything in the service of her majesty is now back in gear and meets the high-profile actress Ophelia Bulletova, who is played by Olga Kurylenko.
At the same time, the Prime Minister is fascinated by the magic of the fascinating billionaire within the tech industry, which is said to be able to solve from the computer of the United Kingdom: it is the evil Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough start their adventure: they turn on the fine French restaurant dummies that serve, they cause usla as they sneak into the luxury Volta, and English turns everything upside down when he tries to use virtual reality glasses to introduce himself to the interior of the Volta.
There is nothing to save in the final scene, but even though the film is lively and energetic, it still absorbs some of the childish material in it as a whole.
Moderately good substance.
And just like with the other Johnny English films, I couldn’t help but think: can the British film industry let Rowan Atkinson have a role that really fits his skills?
The Labour Party denies that it is preparing a plan for a four-day work week for Britain, with the same pay as for a five-day week.
The working class, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is now contemplating a radical plan that would allow Britain to work four days a week, but get paid for five.
According to the report, the group wants to let business leaders take advantage of the savings generated by the revolution in artificial intelligence, and let employees benefit from having one extra day off.
Then the staff could enjoy three days of long weekends, without falling in wages.
Sources say the idea would “fit in” with the party’s economic plan and its policy of improving the interests of the working people.
Trades Union Congress has been supporting the shortening of the working week to four days, as a way for working people to take advantage of changes in the economy.
A senior Labour official told the Sunday Times: “It is planned to announce a policy review by the end of the year.
“The change will not take place overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal that fits the group’s approach to transforming the economy for the benefit of the working people and the group’s overall industrial policy.”
The Labour Party would not be the first party to support this idea, but the Green Party promised a four-day work week in its 2017 election campaign.
The goal, however, is not supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A spokesperson for the Labour Party said: “The four-day working week is not on the party’s policy paper and the party is not considering introducing it.”
John McDonnell, the shadow ministry’s trade minister, used the Labour Party’s conference last week to outline his ideas for a social revolution within the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to recapture the powers of “unknown CEOs” and “farmers” of providers.
The shadow minister’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water utility companies may not get their entire stake back, as the Labour Party government could impose a “blowback” due to alleged misconduct.
He has also confirmed plans to put working people on company boards and create a joint-ownership fund to leave 10 percent of private company assets to their employees, who could receive <0xC2><0xA3>500 in annual returns from them in their pockets.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy say “60 minutes” if FBI investigation on Kavanaugh could get them to change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has resulted in at least a week-long delay in the final vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court, raising the question of whether its findings could get senior congressmen of the republics to withdraw.
In an interview to be aired on Sunday, Scott Pelley, a reporter for the "60 Minutes" show of the republics and senior congressmen John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, asked if the FBI could point out something that got them to change their minds.
Kennedy appeared to be more open-minded than his South Carolina counterpart.
“I mean, of course,” Kennedy said.
“I said when the trial started, I said I was talking to Kavanaugh judges.
I called him after the charges were filed and asked, “Did you do this?”
He was determined, firm, unshakable.”
Graham’s vote, however, seems unchangeable.
“I’ve made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh and it would take an incredible amount of effort to change that,” he said.
“Dr. Ford, I don’t know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it,” Graham added, pointing to Christine Blasey Ford.
“And everyone she mentions by name couldn’t confirm it.
This case is 36 years old.
I don’t think anything new will change.”
What is the International Day of Persons with Disabilities and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
The International Citizen Festival (Global Citizen Festival) will be held on Saturday in New York. It is an annual music event where a series of big stars will emerge and with similar impressive direction; ending poverty around the world.
This is the seventh year that the International Citizen Festival is held and tens of thousands of people will flee to Central Park, not only to listen to music from Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to draw attention to the real purpose of the 20th anniversary of the festival.
The International Civil Festival, which was first held in 2012, is part of the Global Poverty Project, but there are international struggle groups that want to end poverty by increasing the number of those who fight against it.
To get free tickets to the event (except for those who want to pay for VIP tickets), concert guests needed to complete a variety of tasks, or “actions,” such as volunteering, sending an email to one of the world’s leaders, making a phone call, or using other valid means to help.
But how much success has the festival achieved, already 12 years in the making to reach the goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts a real way to convince people to call for action, or is this just one so-called “lucky action” – where people feel it does something that matters by signing up to a solicitor online or sending a message on Twitter?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has recorded over 19 million “actions” from its supporters, to call for a variety of different goals.
It says these actions have helped get the world’s leaders to declare commitments and policies equivalent to over $35 billion that will impact the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group counted 390 commitments and announcements due to its actions, of which at least $10 billion has been invested or raised.
The group estimates that the money raised so far has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
One of the main liabilities comes from The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based investment firm and executive that works to “help children enjoy themselves to the full,” and pledged to provide $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition in the country.
“With the support of the UK government, donors, governments around the world, and international citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a thing of the past,” Tracey Ullmann, representative of The Power of Nutrition, told a London audience.
The group also said that after 5,000 rulings were sent that Britain should improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children and provide them with better nutrition.
In the list of frequently asked questions on the group’s website, one question is: “Why do you think you can end a sore poverty?”
Global citizen replied: “It will be a long and difficult task – sometimes we will fail all the time.
But, we will reach our limits, just like movements that fought for the rights of citizens and the abolition of racial segregation before us, because we are stronger together.
The event will be hosted by Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, and Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e, and will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use U.S. Navy as an “obstacle” to stop Russia’s energy exports, says Interior Minister
“If necessary,” Washington could use the Navy to prevent energy from reaching Russia’s market, including in the Middle East, according to Ryan Zinke, U.S. Secretary of the Interior, according to a Washington Examiner report.
Zinke argued that Russia’s assistance to Syria, especially since the country works at the disposal of the legitimate government there, would be a proposal to explore a new market.
“I think the reason for their existence in the Middle East is that they want to do energy trade as in Eastern Europe and its southern parts,” he said.
And, according to a public announcement, there are ways and means to counter it.
“The United States can use the Navy to ensure that sea lanes are open and to create barriers, if necessary, to ensure that the energy from them does not enter the market,” he said.
Zinke pointed to a guest meeting offered by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a charity group that calls itself the “voice of the energy industry” in the United States.
He continued to bring Washington’s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran together and said it was more or less the same.
“The economic option for Iran and Russia is more and less exploitative of energy supplies and to exchange them for others,” he said, adding that Russia has only one card in its sleeve with an economy that depends on fossil fuels.
The announcement comes after the Trump administration wants to increase its exports of natural gas to Europe and replace Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To do this, officials in Trump’s administration, including President Donald Trump himself, have tried to get Germany to stop participating in the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 project of laying a new energy pipeline, which Trump says would make Berlin “capture” Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly maintained that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 power pipeline, which will double the capacity of the current pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is only an economic project.
The Russians say that Washington’s strong opposition to the project is simply driven on for economic reasons and that it is an example of unfair competition.
“I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for applying pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers,” Alexander Novak, Russia’s energy minister, said after a meeting with U.S. energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The U.S. position has been criticized by Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s leading industrial association, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States not to trade in the EU’s energy policy and a bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"I am very unhappy that the foreign state is replacing our energy supply," Dieter Kempf, chairman of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will “consider seriously” presenting herself to the presidency in 2020, she says
Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts congresswoman, said on Saturday she would "consider seriously" presenting herself to the president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that she would consider attending a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
“It’s time for women to go to Washington and get our government right, and then we need a woman as a leader,” she said.
“After November 6th, I will seriously consider inviting myself to the office of President.”
Warren spoke about President Donald Trump at the meeting, saying he was “going with the country in the wrong direction.
“I’m very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren has been disgusted by his criticism of Trump and Brett Kavanaugh, his appointed Supreme Court justice.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter that "of course we have to have the FBI investigate the matter before the vote takes place."
However, a poll released on Thursday shows that the majority of voters in Warren County do not feel it should be offered in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senior congressman should not offer, according to an opinion poll published by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent said they supported her offer.
The poll showed more support for the offer of Deval Patrick, a former governor, where 38 percent said they supported his possible offer and 48 percent said they opposed it.
Among other popular Democrats rumored for a possible 2020 presidential bid were Joe Biden, a former vice president, and Bernie Sanders, a senior congressman from Vermont.
Biden said he would make a public decision in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin talks about Trump's election campaign at Donald Trump's election rally
Track Palin, 26, was in Iraq for a year after joining the military in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
“My son is going through a lot of trouble after coming back, I feel with other families who are affected by the disaster and the spiritual wounds that our troops are returning home with,” she told audience members at an election rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room" and said that her son and other soldiers "come back only differently, they are hardened and wonder if any respect is paid for what their comrades in the military and the air force and other branches of the military have done."
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, attempting to prevent a report of domestic violence, and for possession of weapons under the influence of alcohol, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and Washington D.C. support challenge against new heli-conduct policy
Eighteen states and the City of Washington are legally supporting a challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies victims fleeing gang or domestic violence on bail.
Representatives of the 18 counties and the city filed a court report on Friday in Washington in support of a pro-democracy asylum seeker protesting the move, according to NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her husband, “and his violent sons who were members of the gang,” had used violence against her, but U.S. officials rejected her application for asylum on July 20.
She was placed in custody in Texas.
The prosecutions, which support Grace, described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries where problems related to domestic violence are increasing. The number of asylum seekers to the United States comes from these countries.
The new asylum policy recalls a ruling that the Committee of Appeals for Immigrants had set in 2014 to allow unregistered immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, a Washington state prosecutor, said in a statement on Friday that the new policy “promoted decades of state and international law.”
“State law requires that a decision be taken on all asylum applications based on the facts and circumstances of the application, and this policy violates this rule,” the court said in a statement.
Lawyers also said in the report that the policy of denying entry to immigrants was detrimental to the U.S. economy, arguing that immigrants were more likely to start a business and “have a significant workforce.”
Jeff Sessions, a state prosecutor, ordered immigration judges to stop granting bail to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Those who leave their homeland because of persecution based on race, religion, nationality or membership of a particular community group or political opinion may apply for asylum,” Sessions said in a statement on June 11.
Healers were never meant to solve all the problems, not even all the serious problems, that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue operations in a race to find survivors in Palu, the death toll doubles
Things are going to get tougher for those who survive.
“There’s a lot of tension in the air,” said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her sick son at the aid center in the city of Palu.
“The ambulances are coming here all the time.
“There’s not much clean water.”
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes and searching for their water-soaked belongings to try to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overcrowded and damaged by the earthquake, which measured 7.5 on the Richter scale.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered back and shoulder fractures, lay outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were slumped outdoors due to a continuing powerful aftershock.
Tears filled his eyes as he recounted how he found the earthquake shaking his hotel room on the fifth floor, where he was with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to save ourselves.
I'm pushing up to the wall, I think," Haris told the Associated Press and said his family had been in town to go to a wedding.
“I heard my wife call for help, but then silence.
I don’t know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe.”
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘requests’ with ‘landing announcements’
A week after an official newspaper in China published a four-page ad in a U.S. newspaper to discuss mutual benefits in trade between the two countries, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. media to disseminate propaganda.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, last Wednesday spoke about the announcement of the Chinese newspaper in the newspaper Des Moines Register - which is the best-selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the U.S. elections that will take place on November 6.
Trump’s claim that Beijing wanted to meddle in the U.S. elections marked what U.S. officials told Reuters news agency as a new stage in Washington’s escalating campaign to apply Chinese pressure.
While it is normal for foreign governments to publish ads to push for trade, Beijing and Washington are having a tougher trade war, with new tariffs on imports from both countries.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China’s retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hurt expatriates in counties like Iowa, which backed Trump’s Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa for a long time, but the state is exporting a lot of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad said in a submission in Sunday's Des Moines Register that "China is now stepping up its persecutions by publishing campaign announcements in our own free media."
“By extending its mandate, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America’s beloved freedom of speech and our free media by publishing a cost-effective ad in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad said in a statement.
“On the other hand, there are few protestors in newspaper outlets on the streets of Beijing, and no true reflection can be found on the different views that the Chinese might hold on China’s worrying economic policy, where the media is trapped under the carpet,” he said.
He added that “one of the largest newspapers in China avoided the offer to publish” his article, but he did not specify which one it was.
Experts warn that the republics are making female voters question them for the mid-term elections with the Kavanaugh issue.
Experts have warned of negative reactions, especially from women, in the next mid-term elections, because many Republicans have supported and defended Brett Kavanaugh, the appointed Supreme Court Justice, who has accepted the allegations of sexual harassment.
There have been very strong feelings around this issue and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they wanted to start voting.
"It's not possible to back up this stuff," Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School Foundation at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted the appeal of Jeff Flake, the senior Republican congressman in Arizona, in the last minute about an FBI investigation sufficient to calm the angry voters.
“Women won’t forget what happened yesterday, they won’t forget it tomorrow and they won’t forget it in November,” Karine Jean-Pierre, chief executive and spokesperson for the liberal group MoveOn, said on Friday, according to the Washington D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” as they protested along the corridors of the Elders’ Department when the republics that controlled the adjudication committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh’s appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Reuters.
“The interest and enthusiasm of voters will go out of control,” Stu Rothenberg, an independent political analyst, told the news website.
“People will say that the interest has already been great and that’s true.
But he could be bigger, especially with female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18-29 years old, who dislike the president, but rarely vote."
Investigators predicted a setback if the republics pressed for Kavanaugh to be confirmed, even before Ford's testimony in which she declared her allegations of sexual harassment from him.
“It’s become a big hoax for the Republican Party,” Michael Still, a former Republican National Committee member, said early last week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the votes of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be allowed to sit on the bench, it’s also about how the Republicans have handled this and how they’ve dealt with it,” said Guy Cecil, chairman of Priorities USA, a group that helps the opposition.
However, Americans seem to disagree on who should believe the testimony of both Ford and Kavanaugh, and a small majority supports the latter.
A new YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents certainly or probably believed the testimony of Ford, while 35 percent said they certainly or probably believed the testimony of Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent of respondents said they believed Kavanaugh had probably or certainly lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following the Flake appeal, the FBI is now investigating the allegations made by Ford and at least one other woman, Deborah Ramirez, according to the Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week, saying Kavanaugh had assaulted her when she was 17 and that he had been under the influence of alcohol.
Ramirez says Kavanaugh had her genitals in front of her when they were both at a party at Yale University in the 1990s.
The man who invented the internet has plans to launch a new internet to fight against Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the man who invented the internet, plans to set up a startup to fight Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The last project of the technical fiction, Inrupt, is a company based on Solid, the open platform of Berners-Lee.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people are allowed to access which information.
In a private interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt was "world domination."
“We have to do this now,” he said of the startup.
“This is a historic moment.”
The app uses technology from Solid to enable people to create their own “personal online data store” or POD.
It may include a list of contacts, task lists, calendars, music collections, and other personal and work-related devices.
It is similar to the fact that Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all present in one browser and all at the same time.
The unique thing about the personal data store is that it is completely up to the user who can access any information.
The company calls it “personal empowerment through the use of data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, the idea that Inrupt is that the company provides access, process and appropriate skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Now the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security program purchased by IBM, several programs that were hired as developers to work on the project, and a group of developers in volunteer work.
Starting this week, tech developers around the world could create their own independent apps with the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team shouldn’t be in talks with “Facebook and Google about whether there should be a total change that would put their current business model on their head in one night.
“We don’t ask for permission.”
Berners-Lee wrote in an article published Saturday on Medium that Inrupt had "a goal of creating energy in business and the ecosystem that helps protect the honesty and quality of the new website built on Solid."
Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet in 1994 when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will continue to be the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation of the Open Data Institute, even as Inrupt is established.
“I’m full of optimism for the next season of the network,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Priest and holder of the Victoria Cross from the First World War honored
The only English priest to be honored with the Victoria Cross in the First World War as a soldier has been hailed in his hometown 100 years later.
Séra Bernard Vann, who held the rank of underprivileged in the army, received the cross on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, killing him secretively four days later, he was never told that he had received the highest honour of the British army.
His two great-grandsons unveiled a memorial to him in a roller coaster in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his great-grandsons, Michael Vann, said it was “pretty symbolic” that the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s death.
According to the London Gazette, Vann led his army on 29 September 1918 across the Canal de Saint-Quentin cut "through the thick fog and under heavy bombardments from mortars and machine guns."
Later, he ran to the firing line and with "great courage" he carried the line forward before he managed to shoot down one of his team and overwhelm three soldiers.
He was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s heroes were “something I could never do, but something that makes a person humble.”
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also laid the wreath after the procession, which was conducted by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he would be “very honoured to be part of the show,” adding that “the deeds of a true hero are shown with the support that so many show.”
MMA fans woke up all night to watch the Bellator 206, got instead to see the Gurra grass
Just imagine, having woken up all night to see the overcrowded Bellator 206, just to be denied to see the main event.
The show featured 13 San Jose combatants, including six on the main roster, and aired live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory McDonald were preparing to fight, British viewers received an unexpected reaction when the broadcast turned into a Gurra pig.
Some were unhappy after waking up all night to watch the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the changes to the children's magazine as "some kind of sick joke."
“According to official rules, the material was not suitable for the audience at six o’clock in the morning so they had to switch to baby food,” said Dave Schwartz, vice president of marketing and communications for Bellator, when he was asked out on the broadcast.
"Shut up, yes."
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said they would go over their schedules and include viewers in the UK in the account in the future.
“I think when I think about the revision, we could probably get rid of it,” Coker said.
“But it’s six o’clock in the morning on Sunday there and we can’t get out of this until Sunday at our own time, which is Monday.
But we are working on this.
Believe me, when the broadcast was switched, many text messages were sent back and forth, and they were not all friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn’t, it was a public problem.
I promise this won’t happen next time.
We limited the night to five battles instead of six, as usual, but we tried too much and went ahead.
It’s an unfortunate situation.”
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley found "disappointing" because of sexual orientation
Olympic gold medalist Tom Daley says he has felt inferior to other people in his upbringing because of his sexuality, but that it has encouraged him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daley said he didn’t realize that “he was different from everyone else” until he went to college.
On the radio station Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, with Lauren Laverne, Daley said he was talking about the rights of homosexuals to provide “victory” to others.
He also said that his role as a parent has diminished his interest in winning the Olympics.
Kirsty Young, the regular cast manager, has taken a few months off due to illness.
Daley appeared in the first episode of Laverne and said that he felt he was a "lesser man" than everyone else when he was a child because "it was not accepted in society to be liked by both boys and girls."
He said: “Until today, these feelings of feeling inferior have given me the strength and strength to succeed in a different way.”
He wanted to prove that he was “something,” he said, so that he would not cause any disappointment when his sexuality finally surfaced.
The two-time Olympic champion has been widely hailed as an LGBT supporter and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more nations to legalize homosexuality.
He said he let himself be heard because he thought he was lucky to be able to live publicly without punishment and wanted to give others "hope."
The three-time world champion said it would have "surprised him" to fall in love with the man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he first met in 2013.
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, saying the age difference had never been a problem.
"When a man goes through so much at such a young age" - but he participated in his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it would be difficult to find an equal who would have experienced similar success and difficulty.
The couple gave birth to a baby boy in June, a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley and Daley said his "all views on life" had waned.
“If you had asked me last year, it’s all about winning gold,” he said.
“You know what, there are more important things than a gold medal at the Olympics.
Robbie's my Olympic award."
His son is christened in the head of Robert, his father who died in 2011, at the age of forty, after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father had not agreed that he would die and one of the last things he had asked about was whether they had already received their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
“I couldn’t tell him he wouldn’t live long enough to sit in the front row,” he said.
“I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn’t until his breathing stopped and he was let out that I finally acknowledged that he wasn’t invincible,” he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
“I just knew that I had dreamed about this all my life, to immerse myself in front of the audience at home at the Olympics. It doesn’t feel any better,” he said.
It was also an inspiration to the selection of the first track - Proud by Heather Small - that had given him inspiration for the Olympics and still gave him a goosebumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11.15 am local time.
Mickelson in bad shape and left to sit on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will hit the mark on Sunday when he plays his 47th game in the Ryder Cup, but he needs to find his old rhythm again so that the score is not surrounded by bad memories.
Mickelson, who plays in the competition for the 12th time, is rated, was let sit on the class after the decision of the chairman Jim Furyk for the four-ball and four-game competitions on Saturday.
Instead of being the center of the game, as he has been so many times before the United States, the day of the five-time champion is divided between being batsman and practicing the paces on the field in the hope of correcting what he fears.
Mickelson, 48, was never the one to shoot directly with the dragons, and is not the best player for the Le Golf National golf course, where limps often want to punish for bad shots.
And it's not enough that the golf course is a big challenge in itself, but Mickelson needs to compete against Frances Molinari, the winner of the British Open, in the ninth game on Sunday. Molinari is with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood in the team and together they have won all four of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four levels below when they take the first game of 12 single-player games, reach a good start, the game of Mickelsons could change creations.
Fury expressed confidence in his man, but he could hardly say much else.
“He totally understood the role he had today, patted me on the back and took over and said he would be ready tomorrow,” Furyk said.
“He has a lot of confidence.
He’s in the Hall of Fame and he’s been so much better for the team before and this week.
I didn’t expect him to play two games.
I saw more for myself, but that’s how it ended and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will hit Nick Faldo in a number of games played at the Ryder Cup on Sunday.
This could mark the end of a process in the Ryder Cup that has never reached quite as high as other achievements on his list.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and 7 draws, but Furyk said his presence would have a definite unintended impact on the team.
“He’s funny, he’s cool, he’s cranky, he likes to make jokes about people and it’s great to have him in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players enjoyed fighting him this week as well, and it was fun to see.
He gives so much more than just the golf game.”
Thomas Bjorn, the President of Europe knows that a lot of progress can quickly disappear
European leader Thomas Bjorn knows from experience that a good head start for the last day of the individual race in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an unpleasant experience.
The Dan played first in Valderrama in 1997, where, alongside chairman Seve Ballesteros, he had a five-point lead over the Americans, but managed to claim victory in the end with the least possible score, with 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 wins.
“It’s a reminder that we had a lot of lead in Valderrama, we had a lot of lead in Brookline where we lost and in Valderrama where we won, but only right,” said Bjorn, who is seen here in the picture, after watching the 2018 season win 5-3 on both Friday and Friday.
The story will show me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
We'll all go forward tomorrow.
Let's go and do everything right.
This is not finished until all the levels are on the table.
We have our goal and it is to try to win this cup, we focus on it
I have always said this, I focus on the 12 players in our team, but we are very aware of our opponents in the other team - the best golfers in the world."
Bjorn was extremely pleased with how his players had stood on the difficult pitch and added: “I never go beyond myself in this.
Tomorrow is going to be different.
Tomorrow it is the performance of the individuals that matters, and that is another thing.
It’s great to play with a partner when everything is going well, but when you play alone you’re trying everyone’s skill as a golfer.
It’s the message you need to send to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he also has to play his best game himself."
Unlike Bjorn, his opponent, Jim Furyk, will strive for his players to stand out better in individual games than with a teammate, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of four.
Furyk himself has experienced both sides of this great transition on the last day, but he was victorious with his team in Brookline but ended up losing when Europe carried out the "power work in Medinah."
"I remember every damn word," he replied, wondering how Ben Crenshaw, who was in charge in 1999, had encouraged his players to continue for the last day.
“We need to play 12 important games tomorrow but you want to start fast like you did in Brookline and Medinah.
When that step gets closer to building up, it puts a lot of pressure on the games that are in the middle.
We've arranged our players according to that and let them play as we think they'll do best tomorrow."
Thomas has been given the task of trying to lead the defense and play against Rory McIlroy in the first game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter as the other European players in the first half of the games.
"I chose these players in this order because I think they cover all the way through," Bjorn said of his selection of players in the individual competition.
Germany's new navy to be rescheduled
The latest German naval ship should have been built in 2014 to replace the old Cold War-era ships, but it won’t be ready until the first of next year due to faulty systems and rising costs, according to local news reports.
The construction of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class fleet, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to a military spokesman who spoke to Die Zeit newspaper.
The ship was supposed to be taken advantage of by the Navy in 2014, but serious problems after the delivery of the plowed project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are to replace the Bremen class ships, which have been in service for many years.
They should be equipped with a more powerful firearm, a number of air defense and command-line missiles, and concealment techniques such as reduced radar-infrared, and audible signals.
Other important features are a longer service life - it should be possible to use the latest ships for up to two years away from their home ports.
However, constant delays mean that these latest type of ships - which are said to allow Germany to show its strength at sea - will become obsolete when they are finally taken advantage of, says Die Zeit.
The F125 military ship came to the news last year when the German military officially refused to take the plane and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This is the first time the ship has been returned to the manufacturer after delivery.
Little was known about the reasons behind the divorce, but German media spoke of many women seriously “crazy in software and hardware” that rendered the military ship useless if it were sent to the army.
The bugs in the software were particularly important because the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class army will be controlled by a crew of 120 people, which is half that of the Bremen-class army.
It also revealed that the ship was too heavy, reducing its performance and limiting the Navy's ability to make improvements to it in the future.
The 7000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is estimated to be twice the weight of a similar class of ship used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from defects in the hardware, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the staff - is beginning to cause problems.
It is said to have reached <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3.1 billion (US$3.6 billion), but was originally supposed to be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2.2 billion.
Problems affecting the latest ships are particularly important in light of the warnings that German overhangs at sea are diminishing.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the head of the German parliament’s defence committee, acknowledged that the navy was in fact becoming a “captain with a functioning ship.”
The representative said that the problem had subsided over time, because older ships were taken out of service but no ships came in their place.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships could be used by the navy.
The National Trust Nature Conservation Association investigates the secret life of leatherbacks
A new study, which is being carried out in the Scottish Highlands, aims to find out how leather ducks use the landscape when they fish for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of these unique flying mammals and help guide conservation efforts in the future.
The study, led by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland, will monitor different types of leather blocks in the Inverewe gardens in Wester Ross.
A special recording device will be installed at key locations around the area to monitor the behaviour of the leather forms over the period.
NHS staff and volunteers will also go on surveillance trips with handheld sensors.
Experts will sonically analyze all recordings to get to the frequency of calls, which the leather sheets give off, and what types do what.
Maps of habitats and reports will then be published to create an accurate picture of their behaviour on a geographical scale.
Rob Dewar, a night owl advisor for NTS, hopes that the results will shed light on what kind of habitat is most important for the leather blocks and how they are used by each type.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, e.g. by creating grassland and how best to maintain forest land for leather blocks and other related species.
Leatherbacks have declined significantly in the last century in Scotland and across the UK.
They are at risk due to construction and development projects that affect their nests and reduce habitat.
Windmills and lights can also cause risks, including flypaper and certain chemical treatments on building materials, as well as attacks from domestic cats.
In fact, they are not blind.
However, their ears are much more useful than their eyes when it comes to quick fishing, because they are used to fishing at night.
They use advanced mining technology to find insects and parts that are on their way to their flight.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76000 hectares of land across the country, takes leather blocks very seriously.
The associations employ ten experts, who carry out regular checks, nesting checks and sometimes rescue operations.
The association has even set up Scotland’s first and only leather-bleached reserve at the Threeve farm in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight out of ten leather-bleached species in Scotland own a home.
David Thompson, the manager of the farm, says he is the perfect area for them.
“The area here at Threave is great for leather blocks,” he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of mature trees and lots of good housing.
But there’s still a lot of unknowns about leather blocks, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to be cleaned up.”
He stressed the importance of checking with leather blocks before maintenance is carried out in dwellings, where possible unintentional destruction of one hair can kill up to 400 female and young leather blocks and destroy all the leather blocks in the area.
Leather blocks are protected and it is forbidden to kill them, harass or disturb, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish representative at the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to help.
She said: “We still have a lot of unlearned about leather blocks and we don’t know how well many of their species are doing.”
Ronaldo Denies Rape Claims As Lawyers Prepare Lawsuit Against German Journalist
Cristiano Ronaldo has called accusations against him of rape "fake news" and says people want to "attract attention" by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the accusations.
The Portuguese and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He is said to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, according to Der Spiegel news on Friday.
Hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, said in an Instagram Live video to his 142 million followers that they were “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
"What I said today is false news," the world champion told the camera five times.
“These people want to draw attention to themselves by using my name.
It's normal.
It wants to be famous by using my name, but it’s part of the job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine," the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the charges, which they have called "unacceptable disclosure of a suspicion concerning privacy," according to Reuters news agency.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said Ronaldo would demand compensation for "a defamation of the same amount and severity of the breach, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years."
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After visiting the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player's room, where he allegedly raped her in the rectum, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga said Ronaldo had fallen to his knees after an incident and told her he was "99 percent a good man" who had fallen into temptation because of "1 percent."
The documents allege that Ronaldo had agreed that the couple had had sex but that it had been with the consent of both of them.
Mayorga claims that she went to the police and had pictures taken of her injuries in the hospital, but finally accepted consent outside the courtroom because she was "deadly afraid of retaliation" and worried about being "publicly humiliated."
She now says she wants to stop the sweets because she is still in shock after a supposed incident.
Ronaldo was close to going to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the rape was supposed to have taken place, and this summer he switched to the Italian giant Juve with a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million contract.
Brexit: UK would ‘see to it forever’ to lose automakers
Britain would “look after forever” if it lost its position as an international leader among automakers after Brexit, according to Greg Clark, the minister of trade.
He added that it was a "worry" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, the company would temporarily cease production of its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact from delaying the border if a no-deal Brexit would cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant, which produces Toyota Auris and Avensis vehicles, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“My opinion is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we will see production sites in our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, Toyota’s chief executive officer in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers have raised concerns about exiting the EU without consent on how to conduct international trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford one month after Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say are supply chain risks if a no-deal Brexit becomes a reality.
Toyota’s production line is based on “last-minute” delivery, with parts delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU for custom-made cars.
If the UK withdraws from the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruptions to the borders that the industry believes could lead to delays and shortages of components.
It would be impossible for Toyota to store more than a day's storage at its factory in Derbyshire, the company said, and therefore production would stop.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for a future relationship with the EU "was specifically aimed at preventing these views at the border."
“We need to have a deal. We want to get the best deal that allows us to enjoy not just success in the present, but as an opportunity that we can take advantage of,” he said on BBC Radio 4.
“The evidence, not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers, shows that we need to be able to continue with very effective approaches.
Toyota could not say how long their production would stop, but warned that in the long run, increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a trustee of the Labour Party in the factory, said that his employees were increasingly concerned: “My experience is that when these jobs disappear, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward an accurate and comprehensive plan for our future relationship with the EU."
A meeting between Trump and Rosenstein could be postponed again, according to the White House.
The White House said on Sunday that an important meeting between Donald Trump and Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed again for a week” now that the dispute over Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court’s nominee, is still ongoing.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, a special prosecutor, who investigates Russian bias in elections, the connections between Trump’s aides and Russia’s, and possible obstacles to the president’s judicial progress.
For weeks, there have been rumors in Washington about whether Trump will run state prosecutors and thereby endanger Mueller’s independence.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed carrying a recording device to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of overthrowing the president by using the 25th Amendment to the constitution.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
But last Monday, he visited the White House, amid reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, but he was then with the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he “wouldn’t” want to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was then postponed until he was at the same time as a hearing with the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who has accused him of sexual harassment, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, which further delayed the Senate Senate vote.
Sarah Sander, Trump’s press secretary, was on the Fox News Sunday program.
When asked at the meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “There has not been a date set for him, it could be this week. I think it is possible that he will be suspended for another week because of everything else that is going on at the Supreme Court.
But we do, and I’m always happy to inform the media.”
Some reporters disagree with this statement: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
Actor Chris Wallace has asked why this is happening.
Sanders said that a small number of meetings were not due to dissatisfaction with the fact that television newscasters had "visual skills," but she said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they have visual skills."
She then gave indications that direct communication between Trump and the media would increase.
“The president answers more media questions than any other president has done before,” she said, without referring to sources: “We’ve gone over those numbers.”
“If the media has a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it’s a lot better than talking to me,” Sanders said.
We're trying to do a lot of that, and you've seen us do a lot of that over the last few weeks, and it's going to replace media meetings when you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open meetings or media meetings with other leaders who visit him.
Media meetings with him alone are rare.
The president, perhaps, showed the reason for this in New York this week, when he showed off indiscriminate and at times strange behavior in front of a group of reporters.
Health Minister writes to EU health system staff in Scotland over concerns over Brexit <0xC2><0xB7> Global Voices
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working within the NHS Scotland to express the nation’s gratitude and hope that it will continue to work after Brexit has passed.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter within six months of Britain leaving the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to meet the costs of work permit applications for EU nationals working within the public service sector.
Ms Freeman wrote in her letter: “Discussions between the UK and the EU over the summer over the ruling have continued and are expected to be decided in the fall.
The UK government has also worked on the preparation if a deal is not possible.
I know this must be a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I want to reiterate how much I value the work of all staff, no matter what their nationality.
Partners from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and know-how that strengthens and improves the work of the health service and is beneficial for the patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is truly your home and we want you to stay here for a long time.”
Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Christion Abercrombie, a lineman for the Tennessee State Tigers, had to undergo emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores team on Saturday, according to news from Mike Organ, a Tennessee journalist.
Rod Reed, head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters the impact had been short-lived.
“He came to the sideline and fell down there,” Reed said.
Abercrombie was given oxygen on the sideline by coaches and hospital staff before being put on a stretcher and discharged for further examination.
A representative from Tennessee State told WSMV radio station Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Hospital.
Harris added that there was "no information yet on the nature or severity of the impact" and that Tennessee State was trying to find out when the accident occurred.
Abercrombie, who is in her final year of school, is playing her first season with Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had a total of five technicians on Saturday before he left, which increased his total number of technicians to 18.

The federal government plans to raise <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they purchase real estate in the UK. Surplus will be used to assist the homeless. Theresa May will report this today.
The action will be seen as an attempt to make Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign’s failure to attract young voters by promising housing at a more affordable price and taxing high-income people more.
Individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK need to pay higher stamp duty, and the surplus will go into government actions to help the homeless.
The increase - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the increase that was imposed two years ago on an out-of-home and rental property purchase - could be up to three percent.
The Treasury expects the increase to reach <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new buildings in London are purchased by foreign parties, but this causes price increases and makes it more difficult for those who want to buy property for the first time to enter the market.
Many more prosperous areas of the country – especially in the capital – have become “drinking towns” due to the number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people acquire their first home.
He accused a large construction company of keeping real estate prices high by buying land but not using it, and urged May to stop quotas on affordable housing prices to fix Britain’s “household shame.”
Mr. Corbyn has reported on a number of more significant improvements in housing matters, including rental inspections and the final disposal of rental housing without faults.
He also wants to give the council more power to build a new home.
Theresa May said: “Last year I said that I would dedicate myself to the restoration of the British dream in my first period – that every new generation should enjoy a better quality of life.
And that includes fixing our untapped real estate market.
The doors of Britain will always be open to those who want to live here, work and build their lives.
However, it may not be right that it is as easy for foreign parties and companies with headquarters in foreign countries to buy a home and for skilled British nationals.
For many, the dream of their own home has become all too distant, and the smallness that accompanies homelessness is still all too real."
Jack Ross: ‘My main goal is to train Scotland’
Sunderland coach Jack Ross says it is his “preferred goal” to become Scotland’s coach at some point.
This 42-year-old Scot is now enjoying the challenge of breathing new life into the North-East club that now sits in third place in the first division, three points from the top.
He moved to Sunderland this summer after returning to St. Mirren in the Scottish Premier League last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was injured in the knee and that was the end of it," Ross said in an interview with Sportsound at BBC Scotland.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad as a kid, and there’s always something that has pulled me back.
But that opportunity would only come if I could train the team well.”
Sunderland's forwards include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic club coach said he had no fear of following in the footsteps of such famous names at such a big club, but he had previously rejected coaching positions at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“As always, I will measure my success by thinking, ‘Can I bring this club back to the national team?’
This club is definitely at home in the national team because of its structure and facilities," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to get him there, but I’d probably just look at myself as welcome here if I get the club back up there.”
Ross has only three years of experience, as a coach, after a period as an assistant coach at Dumbarton and 15 months as part of a coaching team for Hearts.
He then helped Alloa recover from falling into the third division, and turned St Mirren, who was about to fall into the division, into the division champion the following season.
Ross claims to be more confident now than he once was on his playing career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
“It was probably a real season,” he says of the period when he became Alloa’s coach.
“I really believed that the coaching job suited me, even more so than playing.
It sounds strange, because I went well, I had decent income from it and enjoyed a measurable success.
But changes can be difficult.
You have to go through a lot every week.
I’m still going through the stress and pressure of the job, but the coaching job just seems right for me.
I always wanted to train and now I do, I’ve never felt better about myself in all my adult years.”

The best time for beer is at 5.30 p.m. on Saturdays, according to a survey
The summer heat wave has proved to be a relief for British bars that have a base, but increased pressure on restaurant chains.
Sales in pubs and bars rose by 2.7 percent in July, while restaurant sales fell by 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, of CGA, a trade advisory firm, who compiled the figures, said: “England’s continued sunshine and unexpected success in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern and the month of June, when bar sales increased by 2.8 per cent, except for what restaurants sold even less.
Salan fell about 1.8 percent at restaurants in June and worsened again in July.
Pubs and bars, which mainly focus on beverage sales, fared better with more ups and downs while restaurants went down.
Pubs that sold food also had a hard time in the sun, but not as much as restaurants.
It seems that people just want to go out for a drink.
Sales of drinks at pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent for the month, while food sales decreased by three per cent."
Paul Newman, from RSM, said: “These results are a continuation of the swing we’ve seen since the end of April.
Weather and the impact of important social events or sporting events are still the biggest factors when it comes to selling at markets outside the home.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still in difficulty, although a reduction in sales of up to 4.8 percent between months is particularly painful above continued pressure due to costs.
This long and hot summer could hardly have come at a worse time for a grocery store and only time will tell whether a temperate temperature, as we have had in August, will improve the situation."
Overall growth in sales at pubs and restaurants, including at newly opened venues, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting how the openings have turned out.

One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
One in five children, all under the age of 11, have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey.
A survey that reached 20,000 students showed an increase in "Insta's services" pages
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of students say they have a “main” account that they show to their parents
One in five children, all under the age of 11, create secret accounts on social media that they keep secret from adults.
A survey that reached 20,000 students showed a huge increase in “verbal Insta” accounts – which is a reference in the Instagram website.
The news has raised concerns about the publication of sexual material.
Twenty percent of students said they had a clean “main” account to show their parents, as well as having secret accounts.
One mother, who went down on her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website, found a teenager who encouraged others to “rape me.”
The study, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the HMC, showed that 40 percent of children aged 11-18 had two accounts and half of them admitted to having secret accounts.
Mike Buchanan, chairman of HMC, said: “It’s a concern that so many young people are trying to create an area online where parents and teachers can’t find them.”
Doyle to be ‘Sportsman’s Voice’ at Scottish Athletics
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as a non-executive director at the Board’s annual general meeting.
Doyle is Scotland’s most successful free-soccer woman and Ian Beattie, chairman of the committee said the nomination would be a great opportunity for those who led the sport to benefit from her vast experience in the international arena over the past decade.
“Eilidh enjoys great respect within sports communities in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and we are confident that sports in Scotland would make a lot of money getting her on the committee,” Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I am very interested in speaking on behalf of the athletes and hope that I can put my best foot forward and help lead the sport forward in Scotland.”
The American, who raced between the 200 metres and 400 metres at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, but has a total of four Olympics, and is now a regular visitor to the BBC, was paralyzed after receiving a short-term blood clot.
He wrote on Twitter: “A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I was getting better and then how much I was getting better.
It has been a hard job but I fully recovered, learned to walk again and do sports exercises today!
"Thank you for your encouragement!"
Breast pump advertisement, which carries the mother with the cow, causes controversy online
The company that manufactures breast pumps is now being criticized online for advertising that carries milking mothers to cows that are milked.
The company Elvie published a press release to mark the launch of what is said to be “the world’s first silent breast pump that can be carried on the outside”. The ad is inspired by music videos and is intended to show the freedom that the new pump provides to mothers who are pregnant.
Four real mothers dance in a row full of hay and cum with a song with lyrics like, “Yes, I milk myself, but you don’t see any tail on me” and “If you didn’t notice it, it’s not the yoke, it’s the breast on me.”
The emphasis continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, I pump the milk from the Christmases.”
However, the ad, which appears on the company’s Facebook page, has caused a buzz online.
The video, which has 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom say it boasts of the “horror” that accompanies the dairy industry.
“Really bad decision to use cow to advertise this product.
Just like us, they need to be calves and carry to produce milk, unless the calves are taken from them only a few days after they are born," he said in a statement.

Another observer wrote: “It is very difficult for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their children?”
Another added: “This ad is totally out of date with the times.”
Others defended the ad, and one woman admitted that the song’s component was “emergency.”
“I think it’s a great idea.
I would have bought it if I had a baby.
I felt exactly like a cow when I was pumping milk out of me.
It's a little crazy, but I took it as it is.
“It’s a great show,” one of the viewers wrote.
Another said: “This is a fun ad that’s directed at mothers who pump milk (often in the workplace or inside the toilet) and feel like ‘cow.’
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry.”
At the end of the ad, the women’s group shows that they’ve all been dancing with the breast pumps hidden in their chests.
The idea behind the ad campaign is based on the fact that many women say they feel like cows when they pump milk out of them.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires or wires and fits comfortably above the bra, which gives women the freedom to move, hold on to their baby and even go out while they pump.
Ana Balarin, co-owner and chief executive of Mother, said: “The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserved a prominent presentation that would spark controversy.
By imitating women as cows, we wanted to direct the cast light to the breast pump and all its challenges, and even show in a fun and familiar way how much sense of freedom the new pump would provide.
This is not the first time Elvie Pumpan has been in the news.
During the London Fashion Week, two children’s mothers showed up at a fashion show for designer Martha Jakubowski, while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to campgrounds near Texas border
The number of immigrant children in detention has suddenly increased even though the number of those crossing the border monthly has remained somewhat the same. Part of the reason is the hard talk and policies that the Trump administration has put forward have made it even more difficult to bring children into the fold in time.
Usually, the foster parents have been unregistered immigrants themselves, and are afraid to put their chances of remaining in the country at risk, by offering themselves to foster a child.
The risk increased in June, when public authorities announced that possible foster parents and other adults within the household would have to submit fingerprints, and that the data would be shared with the immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, the head of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before the Department of Veterans Affairs, saying his organization had arrested a number of people seeking to have single children.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested were not on the case file.
“Nearly 80 per cent of those who are either foster parents or inside a home that fosters children are illegal in the country, and a large proportion of them are illegal immigrants on a lawsuit.
“That’s why we keep looking for those individuals,” Mr. Albence said.
In an attempt to work faster on children’s cases, representatives announced new rules requiring some children to appear in court within a month of their being placed in custody, rather than after 60 days, which was the previous criterion, according to staff working in custody.
Many of them will come through video meetings, rather than in person, to present their case for legal status before immigration judges.
Children who are found to be ineligible to enter the country will be sent out of the country soon.
The longer children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violence or the attempted escape, according to the staff of the shelters and reports released by the system in recent months.
Spokesmen said that these problems were even more likely in a larger institution such as Tornillo, where it is likely that no one will notice even if the child is not difficult, because of how many they are.
They added that moving the children to the campground without giving them enough time to prepare them spiritually or saying goodbye to friends could increase the impact that many of them are already experiencing.
Syria Says U.S., French, and Turkish ‘Army Teams’ to Withdraw Immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also said in his speech at the U.N. General Assembly that Syrian refugees should return home, even if the war in the country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that the foreign army was illegal in Syria, under the false premise that they were fighting terror, and that "they will be treated accordingly."
“They have to withdraw immediately and without any conditions,” he told parliament.
Moualem insisted that “the war on terror is almost over” in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions have had to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue “to wage this holy struggle until we clear all Syrian areas” of both terror groups and “all illegal foreign parties.”
The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of whom train and advise both Kurdish and Syrian Arab armies fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in this war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said conditions were good enough for them to return, and he taught “some Western countries” to “spread unreasonably fear” that encouraged refugees to stay away.
“We have called on the international community and the humanitarian community to facilitate their return,” he said.
“They’re making politics out of something that should only be a humanitarian issue.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not provide any funds for reconstruction in Syria unless there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN says a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a neutral zone at the last major barrier to the conflict has created an opportunity to continue political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented a major attack by Syrian forces backed by Russia, in the region where three million people live.
Moualem, however, stressed that the deal had a "clear deadline" and expressed hope that military action would be directed at jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front, which is linked to al-Qaeda, and that they would "be eliminated."
The UN ambassador, Staffan de Mistura, hopes to be able to attend the first meetings with a new committee consisting of members of the government and the opposition, to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pay the street for elections.
Moualem set out the conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that its work should be limited to “going beyond the provisions of the current government,” and warned against any interference.
Trump will win a second term in the election.
According to that rationale, Mr. Trump would win the 2020 re-election unless the charges and scandals tied to his presidential career, as many liberals are likely to hope for.
In what would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic end of the presidential career ever!”
As it turns out, the audience is not tired.
As of 2014, the best-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million at CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million at MSNBC.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers at its best time, up from 1.7 million viewers four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC’s “The Rachel Maddow Show” has topped the viewership with up to 3.5 million viewers on important news outlets.
“This is a fire that people are attracted to, because this is something that we don’t understand,” Neal Baer, ABC’s director of the drama “Designated Survivor,” said of a government official who becomes president after the house is destroyed in an attack.

However, unlike what is shown on television, the stories from Washington could determine the fate of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can unite and the health of the international economy.
Only those viewers who enjoy what the best of the best have the opportunity to stop watching.
And yet, this is more than just being an informed citizen when one looks at the sixth hour of the group of experts arguing the use of Bob Woodwards on “a near-miss” lawyers for his book “Fear,” or the $15,000 jacket of ostrich leather that Paul Manafort wore (“a coward who is the fodder of Washington,” said in a statement by the Washington Post).
I’ll never look at Super Mario again.
“Part of what he’s doing to make you feel like a reality show is that he’s giving you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the show “Pawn Stars,” who spoke to the staff at a Trump show.

When I got in touch with Mr. Fleiss, 26 degrees of heat and sunshine were outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he kept indoors and watched MSNB while he picked up CNN.
He could not wear himself out, not when Brett Kavanaugh was supposed to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in jeopardy.
“I remember when we were creating all these crazy old-time episodes and people said, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Fleiss told me.
“I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turned out that people were right.”

Money beyond the flow in the narrowest mid-term elections
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th constituency saw the money flowing into it, thanks to a reorganisation of constituencies that resulted in two representatives competing for the same seat.
The newly reorganised Pittsburg area will be represented by Democrat Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another election in a special election last summer.
Lamb is pitted against fellow Republican Keith Rothfus, who is now the representative of Pennsylvania’s old 12th constituency, who is a big contender for the new 17th constituency.
The maps of the electoral districts were reorganized after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old electoral districts were organized in favor of the republics and that it violated the Constitution.
The race in the new 17th constituency has been the start of a competition to fund electoral campaigns between the main funding partners of both categories, the Democratic Constituent Assembly (DCCC) and the Electoral Commission of the Republics (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a special election in March for the 18th constituency of Pennsylvania, but many followed suit.
The Republicans had previously warmed that seat for more than a decade and Donald Trump, the president won the election by a margin of 20 points.
Political experts have given Democrats a bit of a head start.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for its support of China, but then stopped.
Government officials noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little opposition from Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Juan Carlos Varela, President of Panama in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until co-owners of the Trump administration team withdrew.
Foreign ministry officials decided to recall the U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of “a recent decision to recognize Taiwan no longer,” Heather Nauert, the ministry’s spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
However, punishments were only contemplated against El Salvador, which is estimated to have received $140 million from the United States for relief work in 2017, including for drug control, development work, and economic support.
The rejections, which included, among other things, a reduction in financial support and restrictions on the issue of residence permits, would have been painful for the Central American country, where there is a high unemployment rate and a high murder rate.
As the in-house meetings continued, U.S. and Central American representatives postponed the conference on security and economic success and were to follow up on a similar meeting held last year that was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent people from flying.
However, in mid-September, top officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to take place, and thus ended all talk of punishments against El Salvador.
Mike Pence, the vice president, is now to highlight the conference, which is due to take place in mid-October, as a sign of how important it is in the eyes of the government, the reminders said.
The three U.S. envoys also quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, with no new harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
The White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to discuss in more detail the discussions that the U.S. representatives described, including two memoirs, which agreed to discuss the domestic arguments against being anonymous.
Their statements were confirmed by an external analyst who works closely with the board and also spoke about the case against anonymity.
Let's learn the story
The next scandal could be Roberts Mueller’s report, a special prosecutor, on possible actions by Mr. Trump to obstruct justice, but for that accusation there is a variety of public evidence.
It is also said that Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether Mr. Trump’s election campaign has worked with Russia in its attack on our elections.
If the Senate is run by a different party, Trump may have to take responsibility for it, in the time he prepares to meet his constituents again, and perhaps a quorum appointed by his peers.
However, this is very uncertain and I do not want to imply that Trump’s case is indisputable, nor his colleague’s case in Europe.
We all need to choose, both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the battle will be.
In 1938, German commanders were ready to kidnap Hitler, only if Western countries had given him the resistance and support of the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and missed out on the opportunity to avoid the disaster years that followed.
The story revolves around such important points and faster or slower for the unstoppable progress of democracy.
The U.S. is facing a number of important issues right now.
What do we do if Mr. Trump runs Rod Rosenstein, the man who determines the fate of Mr. Mueller’s investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a bad position since this newspaper said that last year he had suggested making secret recordings of the president and discussed whether he was incompetent in office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the news from the Times is not correct.
“How will we respond if the FBI’s newly requested investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or fair, or if he is confirmed in the seat of the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And above all, will we elect a mid-term parliament that will let Mr. Trump shoulder the responsibility?
If we fail these tests, the people will have to endure a long winter.
But I don’t think we will fall, because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi government as she used to be in my embassy.
She survived, moved to the United States, and 60 years later she sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the crocheted cross.
With such a legacy, how can I do anything but look positively to our future?”

Graham Dorrans, Rangers teammate, highlights for the game against Rapid Vienna
Rangers face Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that a win against the Austrians will put them in a strong position to get out of the European division G group. Rangers made a splendid draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month.
Injuries to the knees prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from playing his first game of the season before Villareal ended with a 2-2 draw, but he believes the Rangers can use the results as a stepping stone for better results.
“It was good to get this point for us, because Villarreal is a strong team,” said Dorrans, 31.
“We started the game in the belief that we could achieve something and ended up taking one point.
We might have been able to claim victory in the end, but overall, the outcome was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half and we came in strong in the second half and played better.
Thursday is another important day for the European Union.
Hopefully we can reach three levels but it will be a difficult game because they went well in their last game. But with the spectators supporting us I am sure that we will strive for this and get a positive result.
Last year was difficult, both due to minor injuries and the changes that occurred in the club itself, but now there is a good feeling on the ground.
The team is good and the guys enjoy their training, the training is good.
Hopefully we can go further now, put the final season behind us and achieve success.”
Women lose sleep because of fear of losing retirement savings
While participants in the survey had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few spoke to their family members about it.
About half of the individuals in the Nationwide survey said they talked to their partner about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they would talk about it with their children.
“People want a family member to do it, but it’s not taking the right steps to have those conversations,” said Holly Snyder, deputy director of Nationwide’s life insurance division.
Here's how to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care if you don’t let them know your wishes well in advance.
Talk to your counselor and your family about where and when you get care, because these options can change a lot in terms of cost.
Get your financial advisor involved: Your financial advisor can also help you find a way to pay for this cost.
Among the options you have to pay for long-term care are traditional life insurance with long-term care, mixed life insurance that pays out in cash, to help pay the cost, or self-insurance with your own money – as long as you have it.
Prepare all legal documents: Avoid any legal dispute in advance.
Get your health care provider so that you can nominate someone you trust to oversee your health care, and ensure that your health care provider will act on your wishes if you can’t tell them directly yourself.
Also consider getting a procurator for your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions on your behalf and make sure that your bills are paid if you can’t do it yourself.
Do not forget the details: Imagine that your elderly father or mother lands in an emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Give the information exactly in a written schedule so that you are ready.
“It’s not just about the finances, it’s also about who the doctors are,” Martin said.
“Who are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have a plan ready for you.”

Officials described the shooting, which took place at around 2:30 a.m. local time, as a "random attack."
The victim did not see his attacker.
The man was not fatally injured and police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Since all communications are down, aid workers have been unable to provide any information from Donggala County, which is a region north of Palu and is closer to the center of the earthquake, which was 7.5 on Richter.
More than 16,000 people were forced to leave their homes in Palu after an unfortunate accident.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi region and is located at the bottom of a narrow creek on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. The estimated population was 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a county that covers more than 380 km of coastline in the northwestern part of the island of Sulawesi.
The county, which is an administrative region under the province, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fisheries and agriculture are the main industries in the Central Sulawesi region, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mines are also important in the region, but most of them are in Morowali, which is on the beach opposite Sulawesi.
Floods have hit Palu and Donggala several times in the last century, according to the Indonesian Civil War.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed in a flood and hundreds of houses in Donggala were destroyed.
Floods were also reported in the western part of Donggala in 1996, where nine people died.
Indonesia sits on the active ring of fire in the Pacific Ocean, where earthquakes occur regularly.
Here are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the past few years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Aceh region in northern Sumatra raged over December 26 and triggered a wave of flooding across 14 countries, killing 226,000 people across the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong quakes struck the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds die on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake of 6.8 on the Richter River over southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, triggered a wave of flooding on the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: Earthquake up to 7.6 on Richter rode over the nearby city of Padang, which is the capital of the region in western Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: An earthquake of 7.5 on Richter rode over one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, and raised up to 10 meters high floods that destroyed numerous villages and killed around 300 people.
2016: Grounded earthquake raged over Pidie Jaya County in Aceh and caused destruction and overcrowding as people commemorated the destruction of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No flooding occurred this time, but over 100 lives have been lost.
2018: Major earthquakes rage over the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed hundreds of buildings, and thousands of tourists were temporarily stranded on the island.

Track Palin, the eldest son of Saruh Palin, former Alaska governor and presidential candidate, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, 29, from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, for attempting to prevent a report of domestic violence and stressing arrest, according to a report by the Alaska State Police, which was released on Saturday.
According to a police report, Palin took a phone call from her friend when she tried to call the police to report a suspected crime.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su station, where he is awaiting trial, and is being held against a $500 bond, according to news reports from KTUU.
He appeared in court on Saturday, declaring that he was "not guilty, potty-tight" when asked to declare a crime or innocence, according to the news outlet.
Palin is charged with three Class A felonies, which means he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and had to pay a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a Class B felony, which is punishable by one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged attack.
The case is currently under investigation by the Alaska Department of Homeland Security.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstructing the reporting of domestic violence and carrying weapons under the influence of alcohol in connection with the incident.
His wife told him that he had slapped her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of gunmen in 2016 for teaching her son’s violent behavior in the aftermath of his military service in Iraq.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia: hundreds of people have died
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The earthquake, which was 7.5 on Richter, triggered a tsunami and has destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications systems are down and the number of deaths is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck right in the middle of Sulawesi Island, which lies northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
A video that shows when the incident happened is now circulating on social media.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami struck the beach.
Prosecutors Seek Rare Death Penalty for Suspected Terrorist Attacker in New York City
Prosecutors in New York want a death sentence on Sayfullo Saipov, who is suspected of taking part in a terrorist attack in New York City, which killed eight people. This is a rare punishment that has not been used in the state for violations of federal law since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is thought to have rented a Home Depot van to attack people on a bike path along the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan. He drove down there walking and cycling pedestrians in October.
To justify the death sentence, the plaintiffs must prove that Saipov killed the victim's eight "wanted" and caused serious bodily harm "wanted," according to the will to apply the death sentence, which was registered in the Southern District Court in New York.
Both of these defendants could lead to possible death sentences, according to the court document.
Many weeks after the attack, the federal court charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for criminal purposes, which is usually used by prosecutors in charges against organized crime organizations. Also, Saipov was charged with aggravated assault and aggravated assault.
The attack involved a "numerical planned plan" by prosecutors, describing Sapiov's actions as "horrible, cruel, and immoral."
“Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov was elected to the gymnastics, injury and loss for the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It’s been a decade since New York’s southern province last took a death sentence for treatment.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The death penalty was last carried out in New York City in 1953, against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were killed after being convicted of spying for the Soviet Union in the Cold War two years earlier.
The couple both died in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, who was born in Uzbekistan, showed no signs of repentance in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt good about what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities that he had gotten the idea of the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to show the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty in all 22 sections of the indictment.
David Patton, one of Saipov’s public defenders, said they were “of course disappointed” by the prosecution’s decision.
“We believe that the decision to ask for a death sentence instead of accepting a life sentence sentence without the possibility of a life sentence, will only prolong the impact of this event for all concerned,” Patton said.
Saipov's lawyers had previously asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty's application.
The Conservative MP says that NIGEL FARAGE should lead the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage promised to “activate the people’s army” today in protest at a conference of conservatives.
The former leader of Ukip said politicians would have to "feel pressure" from doubters about the EU, at the same time as one of MPs Theresa May suggested that he should lead the negotiations with the EU.
Conservative leader Peter Bone said at a protest rally in Birmingham that Britain “would have gone out” now if Mr Farage were the leader of Brexit.
But May’s challenge to reconcile deep disagreements between her own teammates came to light even more: Conservatives, who want to remain in the EU, took part in other anti-Brexit protests in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers plan on track and is under criticism from those who are leaning towards Brexit, those who are opposed to it, and the EU.
Voters claimed that she would continue to fight to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition – forcing those opposed to Brexit and the Labour Party to choose between her plan and “disruption”.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave protest march in Solihull that he wanted to “lost the Chequers plan.”
He suggested that Mr Farage should have been allowed to participate and shoulder the responsibility for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he were in the government, we would be out now,” he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: “I will support Brexit but we have to get rid of the Chequers plan.”
He explained his opposition to the EU and said: “We did not fight in world wars to serve others.
We want to write our own laws in our own country.”
Mr. Bone pointed out from the evidence that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: “The idea that the British public has changed their minds and wills to remain silent is completely untrue.”
Andrea Jenkyns, a staunch Brexit supporter, was also at the protest and told reporters: “I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers program is unpopular among the public and the opposition will not vote with it. It enjoys hostility among our compatriots and the activists who are out on the streets electing us.
Do it, quit the Chequers program and start listening."
In a direct message to May, she added: “Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they stand by their promises.”
Mr Farage said politicians would have to “feel pressured” if they were to swindle from the decision taken in the wake of the 2016 vote.
“It’s about trust between us – the people – and our political party,” he said.
“They want to try to cheat Brexit and we’re here together today to say to them, ‘We’re not going to let you get away with this.’”
He added in his message to the crowd: “I want you to let your political party, which is about getting away from Brexit, feel the pressure.
“We are deploying a public army in this country that has won us a victory in Brexit and we will never rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud Great Britain.”
At the same time, EU supporters held a protest march in Birmingham that ended with a two-hour protest rally in the city centre.
A small group of activists waved their banners against Brexit after the group was set up this weekend.
Adonis Lavard, a member of the Labour Party, joked about the security issues that surfaced in the party’s phone app when the conference opened.
“These are the people who tell us that it can have all the computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for borders without barriers, for free trade with Ireland without borders,” he added.
“This is a total disaster.
“There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he said.
Warren plans to "seriously consider" presenting himself to the office of president.
Elizabeth Warren, a senior U.S. senator, says she plans to “consider a serious offer to the presidency” after the November election.
A Boston Globe report said the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future at a public meeting in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has been a vocal critic of US President Donald Trump, is bidding for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was a co-chair of Trump’s 2016 election campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could run against Trump in 2020.
The meeting in Holyoke on Saturday was her 36th in the form of a citizens’ meeting with residents in her constituency, since Trump took office.
A member of the committee asked her if she would like to meet with the president.
Warren responded that it was time for “women to go to Washington and fix our government, and then we also need a woman as a leader.”
Arrest after deadly shooting of Sims from LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced on Saturday that she had arrested one suspect in the case of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims, but he was shot dead on Friday.
Baton Rouge police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
She had previously posted a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a person seen on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot to death near the Southern University campus early on Friday.
“Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result,” Murphy J. Paul, the police chief, told media on Saturday, according to news from 247sports.
Wayde came to defend his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interrogated and confessed to having been on the scene, with weapons in his hands, and admitted to shooting the Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without charge and taken into custody by the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Sims was two meters tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, he played in 32 games, of which 10 in the starting team last season and played an average of 17.4 minutes, scoring 5.6 points and achieving 2.9 rebounds in each game.
Grand Prix in Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the World Championship after Sebastian Vettel gives him the victory seat at the behest of their team.
It was clear from the time that Valtteri Bottas won a seat in front of Lewis Hamilton ahead of the start on Saturday, that orders from the Mercedes team would play a big part in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start at the start, leaving Hamilton almost behind when he held his position in the first two corners and offered Vettel to fight his teammates.
Vettel went first in the pit and allowed Hamilton to drive into the traffic at the end of the group, but it should have been able to reach the finals.
The Mercedes went into the pit one lap later and came out after Vettel, but Hamilton came out after six fights in which the Ferrari driver was forced to leave the inside after facing the risk of being left behind, following defensive attempts in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back of the group and was in seventh place at the end of the first round, on his 21st birthday.
He then led the majority of the race as he delayed changing tyres to try to finish quickly and advance from Kimi Raikkonen to reach fourth place.
He ended up in the pit in the 44th lap but could not increase the speed of the remaining eight laps, and Raikkonen took fourth.
This is a difficult day because Valtteri stood up beautifully all weekend and was a real gentleman to let me out.
The team has stood magnificently to achieve this success," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body image.
US President Donald Trump joked to Senate Majority Leader Dianne Feinstein at a meeting on Saturday, over her claim that she had not leaked the letter from Christine Blasey Ford, with the accusation in the hands of Brett Kavanaugh, appointed Supreme Court Justice, about sexism.
The president spoke at a meeting in West Virginia, but did not speak directly to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, saying that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were "hopeful and cruel and untruthful."
“The only thing that could happen is the wonderful thing that’s been going on in the last few days in the senior division, when you see the anger, when you see people who are angry and sick and cruel and untrue,” he said.
“When you see the posts and the leaks and then they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t.
I didn't do it."
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you do this?
Do you remember her answer... did you finish the document – “oh, hey, what?
Oh, no.
I'm not covering it."
Now, wait a minute.
We're closing... No, we're not closing it," he said, glancing at the senior congressman.
The letter was sent to Feinstein in July, where Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh were made, and was leaked in early September. Feinstein denied that the leak had come from her office.
“I didn’t cover up Dr. Ford’s allegations, I didn’t finish her story,” Feinstein told the committee, according to a report from The Hill.
“She asked me to keep it in confidence and I did as she asked me.”
But her denial didn’t seem to go down well with the president, who said at the meeting on Saturday: “I’ll tell you that, it was a really bad posture.
Maybe she didn’t do anything, but it was the worst body show I’ve ever seen.”
The president continued his defense of Brett Kavanaugh, who has been accused of sexually harassing three women, and argued that Democrats were taking advantage of the charges.
“They are determined to regain power, no matter what methods need to be applied.
You see the cruelty, the desperation, the no matter who they hurt, who they have to choose over in order to gain power and control," the president said, according to a news release from Mediaite.
Elite League division: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars added to their loss on Friday in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants, by winning the next game after, 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants received an early two-point lead after goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equaled for the home side, but Dwyer then overtook the Giants.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard, normally for Dundee, and two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen then secured their victory.
This was the third loss of the season for Adam Keefe in the Elite League, but it had won Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth game between the teams of the season, and the Giants had won the games three times before.
Dwyer scored the first goal in the fourth minute when the clock showed 3.35, after a support broadcast from Kendall McFaull. David Rutherford then came with a support broadcast when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
It was then a long time to be in the first minutes and Sullivan returned the home team to the game when the clock showed 13.10 and Cownie then recovered after a pass from Matt Marquardt in the fifteenth minute.
Dwyer was looking to bring the Giants over for a half-game when he scored his second goal in the game at the end of the first quarter.
The home team recovered and Bouchard was back on target when they were one man over in the 27th minute of the second quarter.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up and helped Nielsen cross Dundee for the first time in the game late in the second quarter and he secured his team a fifth-goal victory when half of the last quarter ended.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, face Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
Air traffic controller gives his life to ensure that hundreds of passengers on a plane escape an earthquake
A flight attendant in Indonesia has been hailed as a hero after he gave his life to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers could take off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday and triggered a tsunami.
Large aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
The 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave, despite the fact that his colleagues had fled the control tower that hovered obsessively at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He was on standby to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway when the earthquake struck, could safely make it to the air.
He then jumped out of the control tower when he thought he was collapsing.
He later died in a hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, a spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said his decision had potentially saved hundreds of lives, according to news reports from ABC News in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to transport it to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
“We are very sad to hear about this,” he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could exceed a thousand, according to the country's anti-terror agency, which says access is limited to the towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong.
“It is said that the number of deaths is still increasing because many bodies are still under rubble and cannot be reached,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Up to six meters high waves have caused huge destruction in Palu, where a mass earthquake will be held on Sunday.
The military and passenger planes are working to bring in relief supplies and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, said in an interview with Sky News: “Every minute a ambulance comes with a body.
There is little clean water.
“Small businesses have been robbed everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, said in an interview with CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to find survivors but we don’t know what they will find there.
It’s already a disaster, but it could get worse.”
Joko Widodo, President of Indonesia, came to Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military: “I ask you all to work day and night to complete all the tasks related to the removal.
“Are you ready?” he told CNN.
Earlier this year, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Air Niugini Says It's Missing After Plane Crashes in Micronesia
The airline, which owned a plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia, now says one person is missing, having previously said that all 47 passengers and crew had been rescued from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that as of late Saturday, it did not know about the abduction of one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about further information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water as it tried to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday and that their condition was stable.
It is still unclear what caused the accident and what the exact sequence of events was.
The airline and the U.S. Navy both said the plane had landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Witnesses said the plane had gone too far over the runway.
Bill Jaynes, an American passenger, said the plane's approach had been very low.
“It was really good,” said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and others could dig deep into the water and find emergency exits in the sinking plane.
He said that the pilots had been frightened and screaming and that he had suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said sailors, who were on the job shortly after making up a pier, also helped with the rescue by using an inflatable boat to ferry people ashore, before the plane sank in about 30 meters of deep water.
Data from the Air Safety Agency show that 111 people have been killed in PNG-registered plane crashes in the last two decades, but none of them were related to Air Niugini.
An expert describes the timeline of the evening as a woman was burned alive
Prosecutors closed their case on Saturday in a retrial against a man accused of burning a woman from Mississippi alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an expert from the U.S. Department of Justice, was in court for many hours as an expert witness in the field of information analysis.
He then explained to the jury how he used cell phone records to puzzle the journeys of the defendant, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, the night she died.
Rowlett said she had received location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was with the Chambers the night she died, contrary to his earlier claims, according to news reports from The Clarion Ledger.
When data showed that his cell phone was with Chamber at the same time as he said he had been with his friend, Michael Sanford, police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he had not been to the town that day.
When prosecutors asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he had been in Sanford’s car that night, Sanford said it was “a lie, because my car was in Nashville.”
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said she had known Chambers for about two weeks before she died.
Mobile phone records showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis had deleted text messages, phone calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He took her out of his life," Hale said.
It is expected that the defenders will move their finals on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be heard later that day.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to fight against negative opinion towards the genre of music by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claims that hip hop has moved away from its origins as it contained political messages and discussed social issues.
They want to look for the origin again and make consciously hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have seen a recent upsurge in the UK through artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A New York City lawmaker has filed for divorce after a “prejudiced” text message.
A New York law-enforcement bride filed for illegal divorce after she received a surprise text message from her mother complaining that she was “another black person.”
The couple, therefore, refuses to be prejudiced and equates the lawsuit with “financial punishment.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her displeasure when she found out that her new foster mother, Giselle Maurice, was black when she went to work for the first time in 2016.
"NEEEEIII OTHER ANSWERING MAN" wrote Mrs Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in text messages.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it twice to Ms. Maurice.
After discovering her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, the "disgraceful" Mrs. Maurice, said that their former foster mother, who was deaf, had become ill, and that she had expected to have a Filipina woman, according to news reports from the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one working day and then sent home in an Uber car.
Maurice now sues the couple and wants compensation for the break-up, amounting to $350 a day for the six-month job she had been initially hired for, though no contract has been signed.
“I wanted to show them that this is not the way to do it,” she said in an interview with Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s a difference.”
The couple have objected to the accusations that they are biased and say that it was the right thing to do in the case of Maurice, because they felt they could not trust her after insulting her.
“My wife sent her a message that she wasn’t going to say.
She's not prejudiced.
We're not prejudiced people," husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
“But who would trust their children for someone after showing the murder in question, even if it was a surprise?
Your new-born child?
Don't act like that."
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “financial punishment,” saying his wife had been on the road for seven months and was in “very difficult circumstances.”
“Are you going to attack someone in this situation?
It’s not very beautifully done,” said Plasco, who works in the investment agency.
The case is still open to the public, but the public has spoken harshly about the pair on social media and shamed them for their behaviour and behaviour.
Paddington’s publishers feared that readers would have a hard time even with a talking bear, says a new letter.
Karen Jankel, Bond’s daughter, who was born shortly after the book was approved, said of the letter: “It’s hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone reading it for the first time before it was published.
“It’s very funny now that we know of Paddington’s tremendous success.”
She said her father, who worked as a BBC host before he was inspired to write a children's book about a small toy bear, had taken the rejection of his work with a rosy positive, adding that the sixtieth anniversary of his book's release was "beautiful".
As for Paddington, who she describes as “an important member of the family,” she added that her father had quietly shown pride in his success in the end.
“He was a very quiet man and not used to riding,” she said.
“But since Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a child doing something, and you’re proud of it, even if you didn’t really do anything yourself.
I think he looked at Paddington's success that way.
Although Paddington had been his creative work and imagination, he always gave Paddington the honour himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye to her over the phone.
When she arrived, her daughter had been transferred to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything in their power to save her life, but without success.
“Nad called regularly and told me that the situation was very bad, that she was not expected to survive,” said Mrs Ednan-Laperouse.
Nad then called me and said that she would die within the next two minutes and that I would have to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my love.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medicines that the doctors had given her to keep her heart rate up were gradually losing their effectiveness and being excreted from the body.
She had died a short time before and it was the body giving up.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing this was all happening.
I couldn’t cry or scream or cry because I was surrounded by family and other people.
I had to control myself.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning her dead daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers who knew nothing of the hardships she experienced.
“Nobody knew,” she said.
“I shaved my head and the tears fell all the time.
It’s hard to explain, but during the flight I felt a lot of sympathy for Nad.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women hang up messages to prevent suicide on bridge
Two women, who had loved ones who committed suicide, are now trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted messages on a bridge in Wales, with encouraging messages and phone numbers that people can call and get help on.
Tyler, the son of Ms. Davis, was 13 years old when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide when he was 18 years old.
“I don’t want any parent to feel the way I do every day,” she said.
Ms. Davis, 45, lives in Lydney and said her son had been a famous cook with an infectious smile.
“He was known for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile could brighten up any room."
He stopped working before he died, because he was “soaked down in a very dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his brother dead after taking his own life.
Ms. Davis said: “I am constantly worried that it will be a result of that.”
Ms. Davis created the message “to let people know that it’s possible to go and talk to others, even a friend.
Don’t sit around and say anything – you need to talk to someone.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who has been Mrs. Davies's friend for centuries, lost Mark, his wife of 15 years, shortly after his mother died.
“He didn’t talk about feeling bad or being depressed or anything like that,” she said.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his mood.
He was up at his worst on Christmas Day—when the kids opened their presents, he didn’t look them in the eye or anything.”
She said that his passing would be a great shock to them, but that they would have to work their way out of it: “This scratch could affect the family.
It breaks us apart.
But we have to keep fighting and fighting.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as FBI investigates
“I thought that if we could get something similar to what he asked for — a study with limited time and scope — we could perhaps reach a little agreement,” Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would “feel divided” in the middle of a dispute.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate the matter?
It’s because of the timing.
The midterm elections are in just five weeks, on 6 November. If the republics go wrong, as expected, it seriously weakens their attempts to get their husband elected to sit on the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling senior congressmen to encourage them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley through him, but she was more special to Mr. Bush.
What happens after the FBI releases its investigative report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will sit as is.
It is not yet certain whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes on the floor of the Senate, but that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to break the tie and confirm him in the post of Supreme Court Justice.
The number of people fleeing North Korea is shrinking under Kim’s rule.
The number of those fleeing North Korea and going to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean senator.
Park Byeong-seung, cited data from the South Korean Unification Council, said 1,127 people had fled last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Park said stricter border warnings between North Korea and China and higher charges levied by smugglers with people were key elements.
Pyongyang has not issued any official statement.
The vast majority of those fleeing North Korea are being offered South Korean citizenship rights.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most are fleeing to China, but it has the longest border with North Korea, and it is easier to cross them than the well-to-do zone between North and South Korea.
China views the refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forces them to return to their home countries.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have technically improved considerably in the past month.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks that focused mainly on adjournment negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This was after a historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed in earnest to work together towards a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, Ri Yong Ho, North Korea’s foreign minister, however, lectured U.S. businessmen about the lack of progress since then.
“Without trust in the United States, there is no certainty about the security of our country and under such circumstances it is impossible for us to unilaterally take down our nuclear weapons first,” Ri said in a speech at the U.N. General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "motherly ill" and says he is unfit to serve as Supreme Court justice
Nancy Pelosi, the leader of a minority in the House, called Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court-appointed judge "motherly ill" and said he was too timid to be able to work in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi dropped these words in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if a woman had ever done something like this, she would have been called a mother’s disease,” Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh’s testimony before the senior division’s adjudication committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh strongly denied the allegations that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening speech, Kavanaugh was extremely emotional, sometimes raising a cry and getting a cake in his throat when he spoke to his family and his school years.
He also publicly condemned Democrats on the committee, calling the charges against him an “ugly and organized genocide” organized by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he could not work on the Supreme Court because he showed he was biased against Democrats.
“I think these claims and how he attacked the Clintons and Democrats show that he is unfit for the job,” she said.
Pelosi did not respond when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh fired if he is confirmed and if Democrats win a majority in parliament.
“I’m going to say this: if he’s not telling the Senate or the FBI the truth, then he’s not only unfit to be in the Supreme Court, but also in the law that he is now,” Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is now serving as a judge in the Washington D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible decisions against the Affordable Care Act or the abortion law Roe v. Wade, where he is considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing, Kavanaugh turned away from questioning whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
“This is not the time for a motherly illness, an obnoxious person to go to the Supreme Court and expect us to say ‘how wonderful it is,’” Pelosi said.
Women need to take advantage of it.
This is a fair talk, months and years of heft flowing out of her and she therefore does not come out without crying.
“We cry when we get angry,” Steinem told me 45 years later.
“I don’t think it’s unusual, but you?”
She continued, “I got a lot of help from a woman who was a manager somewhere and said that she cried too when she got angry, but she had developed a technique so that when she got angry and started crying, she said to her interviewer, ‘You think I’m sad because I’m crying.
I'm angry."
And then she just kept crying.
And I thought it was great.”
Tears are allowed to express anger in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my clearest memories from my previous work in an office with men in the majority, where I started to cry out of heaviness that I could not express, came an older woman and took on the gnarly drama of me. She was a cold-blooded boss that I had always feared a little bit and she died.
“Never let them see you cry,” she told me.
They don’t know you’re a coward.
They think you’re deaf and they’re happy to have reached out to you.”
Patricia Schroeder had worked with Gary Hart when he was in the presidency, but she was then a Democrat from Colorado.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught blustering at the prospect of boarding a boat called Monkey Business (Apaspil) and dragging his supply back, Ms. Schroeder, full of embarrassment, considered that there was no reason for her not to consider offering herself to the president.
“It wasn’t a well-thought-out decision,” she told me, laughing, 30 years later.
“There were already seven other candidates and the last thing they needed to hold was one more.
Someone called it "The White and the Dwarfs of Seven."
As far as the election campaign was concerned, she was still on the money front, so she decided not to bid unless she managed to raise 2 million dollars.
It was a losing battle.
She found that some of her supporters who gave $1,000 to the men gave her only $250.
“Do they think I’ll get a discount?” she asked.
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not formally present herself, she was so overwhelmed by emotions—thankful to the people who had supported her, resenting the system, which made it so difficult to obtain funds and direct her eyes to the voters and to the electorate—instead of expressing resentment.
"I might think I had a nervous breakdown," said Ms. Schroeder, recalling how the media reacted.
“I would say Kleenex is my best friend.
I remember thinking, what will be written on my tombstone?
"Is she crying?"
The reasons why the trade war between the United States and China could be good for Beijing
The first shots in the trade war between the United States and China were ironclad, and although the war is far from over, going between the countries could be beneficial for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, shot the first warning shot earlier this year by imposing taxes on China’s main export products, including solar batteries, steel and aluminum.
The biggest escalation came this week with new tariffs covering goods worth $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion), and taxing as much as half of all goods imported into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has responded in the same coin every time and recently imposed 5 to 10 percent tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has vowed to respond to U.S. tariffs, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will be wiped out soon.
To get Washington to bail out, it would be too humiliating for Xi Jinping, the president of China, to publicly turn away from the United States.
Experts say, however, that if Beijing holds the cards correctly, the pressure from the trade war with the United States could have a positive impact on China in the long run, reducing the mutual need of both economies for each other.
“The fact that a quick political decision, either in Washington or Beijing, could lead to conditions leading to economic collapse in another country is actually far more dangerous than audiences have previously acknowledged,” said Abigail Grace, a researcher at the New Security Center.
Syria 'ready' for refugees to return, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready for refugees to voluntarily return to the country and seek help to rebuild the country, which is now in a bad state after seven years of war.
Walid al-Moualem, the foreign minister, spoke at the United Nations General Assembly and said the situation in the country was improving.
“Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and safer, thanks to the success of the fight against terror,” he said.
The government continues to put itself in a normal situation by building up areas that were destroyed by the terrorists.
Everything is now ready for refugees to voluntarily return to the country they were forced to leave because of the terror and unilateral economic decisions aimed at their daily lives and jobs.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million more, who are still living in the country, need assistance to maintain.
Al-Moualem said that the Syrian authorities would be happy to accept help in rebuilding the country.
He stressed, however, that they would not accept aid subject to conditions or aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the U.S. team with a final score of 16.5 against 10.5 points on the Le Golf National field outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six times in a row on a European basis and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when the team, led by Danish captain Thomas Bjorn, reached the 14.5 points it needed to defeat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had the most difficulty throughout the race, hit his starting shot in the water on the 16th hole, which is par 3, and lost his game against Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari shone brilliantly in all his games and became 1 of 4 players to get the result 5-0-0, since the competition began using its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 against Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark, but he was in the bottom of the ranking of the players of the European team.
Dustin Johnson, who is at the top of the list of the best golfers in the world, lost 2 and 1 against Ian Poulter from England who possibly played in his latest race for the Ryder Cup.
The Spaniard Sergio Garcia, who has played eight times for Ryder Cup, became the most successful European of the competition with 25.5 career points.
“I don’t usually cry, but today I can’t do anything else.
It has been a difficult year.
I am so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I am so happy to have the cup back.
This is about the team, and I was happy to be able to help," Garcia said after Europe's victory.
He's courting his country's John Rahm fan, but he beat American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in a one-way match on Sunday.
“I was incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods. I grew up watching him,” said the 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his games in France and is now listed 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup competition.
This is a strange result for one of the best players in history, who has won 14 major titles and is only in second place after Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find themselves on the field, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played a good game throughout the race.
Former U.S. Rep. Jim Furyk said of his team’s performance, “I’m proud of them, they fought.
It was at some point in the morning that we put pressure on Europe.
We lost him down.
I'll take Thomas upstairs.
He's a great leader.
All 12 of his players play very well.
We'll get back together, I'll work with the PGA in the U.S. and the Ryder Cup committee and we'll keep going.
I love these 12 men and am proud to be their chairman.
You have to take it upstairs.
They played better than us.”
