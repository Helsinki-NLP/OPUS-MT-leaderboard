Don't stand there.
There are many galaxies in the universe.
You always sing.
You're very pale.
She hesitated for a moment.
Could it be done?
I live in Istanbul.
Can I ask you something?
I want us to be more than friends.
Can you explain it to me?
I bought some groceries.
All things come to an end.
You just saved me a lot of time.
I wouldn't hurt them.
It was so cold that his teeth were gnashing.
What's your name?
Where's your dog?
This is the beginning of a new era.
He was Leila's dance partner.
The little bird told me.
Can I take you home?
Tom has his reasons.
Tom said he needed my help.
Without a doubt.
Just tell Tom I called.
We could use some help.
It was love at first sight.
Get up.
I'm not ready yet.
Tom is still frustrated.
I'd like to buy a dog.
Tom made it clear that he wouldn't do it.
Infrared and ultraviolet rays are types of light invisible to the human eye.
This is useful information.
Sit still for a second.
I shouldn't have taken that off.
Tell me what you wrote.
“Learn from your mistakes” and “Experience is the best teacher,” they say, but in the long run even the best teacher gets mad if he or she has too much to teach in too little time.
Share the cards, Tom.
I agree with what you wrote.
There's almost no violence in this town.
They already have one.
You really don't need to do that.
Is your watch accurate?
I hope it's dry weather.
Could you take a look and see if there's enough bread for our lunches tomorrow?
At least 50 passengers were killed.
It wasn't my fault.
I know him well.
Are they in love?

I know everything.
How could I resist?
I bought a lot of things.
I'm just not very happy.
Let me see you, Tom.
There is no rule without exception.
It's hard to trust anyone.
In our world, education is disappointing.
The first thing my mother said to me was, "Are you crazy?"
I've read about a hundred books so far.

I've never camped.
I only listen to you.
He rarely gets angry.
Why do you want to hurt me so much?
How do we know he's innocent?
Did you wash the dishes?
When he returned from duty in Afghanistan, Tom was haunted by nightmares.
I've made up my mind.
My hands are cold.
Thank you very much.
The best teaching you can attend is the one you don’t understand.
It won't have any effect.
Don't go balding.
Do you have the right one?
I need your help.
Don't you like swimming?
I'm a responsible person.
We have wine.
I put his number on a piece of paper.
Add more water.
How was your day?
What Tom suggests could save us all a lot of time.
Italy is a peninsula.
That's beautiful.
He's busy enough now.
We're not proud of it.
It's a Cuban cigar.
That's his car.
Of course!
Tom cooks potatoes to make potato salad.
Everyone else is.
Sign it here.
Come closer.
I'm not always right.
Tell me what that is.
This isn't your hat, is it?
This is my wife, Edith.
That's not a good sign.
I'm trying to figure out how you did it.
Either way, you're wrong.

How did I miss that?
Is breakfast included in the price?

Tom hates strangers.
Fuck you!
We have to respect personal rights.
What's that thing with your right hand?
Can I call you around 2:30?
Anyone want to go to Disneyland with me?
Why is painting trains so interesting?
I don't usually write songs like this.
It's really that simple.
That was a ridiculous mistake.
What do you eat at all?
Don't talk.
Call him what you want.
Don't run in front of the ore!
I feel safe with you.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to do it, but she failed.
Jumi will be a teacher.
I need you.
Fuck you!
His mother is a Yugoslav.
There must be a better way to do this.
That didn't matter to me.
He loves me tomorrow!
It's too noisy for me here.
Tom must have been trying to clean this up without the soap.
It rained so much that we decided to visit it the next day.
I'm glad Tom won.
There's no one like you.
I don't want to work under these conditions.
- Merry Christmas.
Tell Tom you love him before it's too late.
His displeasure angered her.
She rejected my proposal.
The trains in Serbia are very slow.
In that case, let's go.

He was a hero to a hero.
I really need Tom here.
I believe you're being honest.
Come and play with us.
You know Tom ever lied?
Mary is Catholic, but her boyfriend is an atheist.
I'll never tell anyone who you really are.
I'm proud of you.
I saw Marcus' house.
Tom arrived this morning.
He's pretty busy now.
Who is this man?
Here's some good news.
The refugees are welcome.
Many economists are confused about this fact.
I'm proud of my family.
Tom seemed to be very confused.
There was a list of available candidates.
How deep is the lake?
What year is your car?
What's your name?
You have three cats.
Tom never said anything about it.
You're too young.
Don't pull yourself together.
Tom never asked why.
I wouldn't hurt you.
We have no such example.
Come here.
Tom will know.
Her passport was stolen.
I know who killed him.
Did I ask you?
You can't touch it.
I've seen enough so far.
Turn around!
Be nice.
What am I supposed to see?
It stinks.
It took four pounds of gold to win the gold medal.
I'll have dinner at seven.
Give me the sword.
He's not smart enough to pick up the numbers in his head.
Take care of me, and I'll take care of you.
You have to believe me.
I don't think your plan is realistic.
Have you met the man in question?
You want to talk to Tom about me?
I bought this yesterday.
How do you say "cat" in Spanish?
We have to act now.
I'm not afraid of death, I'm afraid of dying.
Everybody says that.
Speak clearly.
I haven't seen him in a while.
We're here to play golf.
I haven't seen her in a while.
I've never actually met Tom.
Don't yell.
This one's unique.
I'm too old for something like this.
We'll just follow you.
Knowing yourself is very difficult.
You'll need it later.
This was a pleasant experience.
Tom's in the garage, working on his motorcycle.
You just got shot.
My income has been cut by 10 percent.
You'll see her.
It can be difficult to visit an unfamiliar area.
They're ready to talk about the problem.

Okay, you don't have that.
Finally!
He appreciates contemporary art.
After a long discussion, I eventually did things.
It's good. It's good.
I can't believe you didn't recognize me.
Does this happen often?
They walked along the beach.
We're shrinking.
Can you talk to me?
Turn down the TV.
I wear short-sleeved T-shirts in the summer.
Old people often talk to themselves.
Tom was hoping to become a famous writer.
He became a member of the club three years ago.
Tom showed me the poems he wrote when he was a teenager.

See you in your dreams.
Come in here.
I'm going home tomorrow.

They told me to wait here.
I'm not young enough to know everything.
The lawyer's job is to prove her client's innocence.
How would you know that?
Tell me what you know.

Canada is the mother country of ice hockey.
What did I forget to say?
How often do you clean your room?
Tom saves so he can go abroad.
I have no intention of changing.
I want to go to Bali.
You can if you try.
I'm the one who gave it to Tom.
I'm glad Tom won.
Okay, how about you?
This is, without a doubt, an extremely unpleasant situation for me.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that.
She's out every morning before breakfast.
This time he's going to town.
I'm not happy with that.
I baked the tongue.
These are my best friends.
I have to live.
We have two sons.
Tom was the only boy invited to Mary's party.
Don't talk.
We had a bad fight.
What has science ever done for us?
Stop watching TV and start learning.
Turn left.
We don't know our neighbors.
You'll find a book in the library.
The police found the stolen money.
I've never had that space before.

I didn't do that either.
How much does a bottle of beer cost?
Where's Tony?
I'd like to talk to Tony.
I'll be back later.
You smell good.
It was obvious that Tom didn't want to kiss Maria.
Tom is so rich that even his servants have servants.
That's the table.
Flowers of flowers.
That's too bad.
His brother is a very capable doctor.
I'm tired of arguing.
I've got plenty of room.
What are you gonna do today?
I'm just thinking out loud.
Don't yell.
I can't stop thinking about the stolen money.
That train passed you.
Come and see us.
The young man is often thoughtless.
I don't think he knows I love you.
I'm not mad at anyone.
They need each other.
Let's go get something to eat.
You think so?
Can we agree not to agree?
I'm trying to be careful.
There's always trouble when it comes to my kid.
Not yet.
One day she wants to study abroad.
Check this out.
Come quickly!
Where's my suitcase?
He wants to get rid of painful memories.
You're absolutely right.
I don't know.
I'm convinced.
Add more water!
Music is important to me.
I worked on it day after day.
Do you have a favorite?
Please, come here.
Just slow down!
No one has a soul.
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
Where there is grass, there is no water; where there is water, there is no grass.
My friend got 95 points on the math exam.
He wouldn't let anyone else in the room.
Better by grace than by force.
I have a lot to do today.
You're in trouble.
I'm not going to school tomorrow.
In the Russian language, there is no such thing as "freedom."
I thought you'd be busy.
It's great.
Could that be true?
Just shut up, Tom.
This bag is mine.
Tom left before I got here.
Tell us a story about ghosts!
I hope Tom's safe.
We talked about it all night.
I want to live in the city.
What are you going to do this summer?
I tried to stop doing more things at the same time.
Let's get out of here.
That must have been hard.
Your wish is my command.
I'll call her on the phone tonight.
I had to make some tough decisions.
Tom is Mary's grandfather.
Ammonia is the base.
Check it again.
Are you being honest?
That made sense to me.
She was educated in the United States.
Tell me what I have to do.
Open your mouth!
I haven't been told anything.
The fire spread to a nearby building before the firefighters arrived.
Tom didn't make friends as easily as Mary did.
I thought this was going to happen a few months ago.
Bad weather prevented me from leaving.
Tom bought the paper.
And that's for me.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
The black smoke came out of the chimney.
I know the gentleman.
You'll never catch me alive!
It is one of the biggest summer music festivals.
I was open and honest.
It's time to go to bed.
Give me a dollar for the book.
Shut your mouth and sit down.
What's this?
It's gone down.
Tom fell asleep again.
Don't move!
He's an American.
Tom's just talking to Mary.
Without a doubt.
The first lesson is easy.
You grew up so fast.
Tom's gonna make it.
I got off the train.
We're brother and sister.
I'm pretty good at doing more things at the same time.
No one is as fast as you.
I agreed to buy it.
She's in a really bad mood.
Am I the only one going to the party?
I really hope you're joking.
Please, be honest with me.
Are you being sarcastic?
Let your imagination run wild.
All right, how about you?
Tell me where you live.
Can you prove that?
You can't go into that room.
What did you do to me?
It's all here.
Why me?
Tom and Mary were wrong about that.
I'm not as tall as you.
How many years have passed since I last saw you?
If you do, you will regret it for the rest of your life.
You're a soul grinder.
Tom was quiet for a moment.
I knew I should never have interfered in your stupid business.
The light is gone by itself.
Tom asked Mary to give him another chance.
Ask the policeman!
We have five fingers on each hand.
We cooperated.
Do you think I missed something?
Tom saves money to buy a yacht.
Everyone except Tom knows why his wife left him.
You're driving me crazy.
What do I write in the news?
The system was completed after three years of volunteer work.
I need your signature.
She called me very late last night.
I had nothing in common with them.
I'm claustrophobic.
Naoko lives in a white house.
The new branch to Haugesund will become the main effective road link to Oslo and East Norway for the entire western region.

Hello, how are you?
He received four emails.
I'm really happy about that.
Tom suspects that Mary and I were targeting something.
Where'd you find this knife?
You look good for your age.
Tom was able to find Mary's house without difficulty.
It's not an easy sport.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I just don't want to do it.
You shouldn't have bought that.
They have the right to vote.
I find it hard to express in words what I think.
Tell me where you are.
Will we see Tom again?
Turn right at the next corner.
My mother cooks for me.
I'm trying to be careful.
A woman eats bread.
I listened to the music.
Are you involved in this?
You know why I'm here?
I hope he doesn't notice my mistake.
I must have eaten something bad.
We'll be leaving soon.
Is Tom still there?
Tom can't swim like he used to.
Everyone knows I don't like Tom.
Both answers are possible.
Tom's working too hard.
Don't rely on the color diluent.
I liked that one.
He did not hide his disappointment.
The boy has a horse.
Do you like roller-coasters?
We've run out of food.
Tom says the same thing.
We just want to go home.
Today is a good time.
Can you smile at Tom?
You have no idea how right you are.
Tom and I were busy.
Proletarians of all countries, unite!
I'm very impressed.
I assumed you were busy.
Tom couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.
Tell me why you did it.
Italy is in Europe.
How many people were there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
So where did Tom go?
It's easy to hang out with Tom.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
You have a right to be happy.
I don't think anyone knows.
You've got to work harder.
Why are you so paranoid?
Tom turned around the room, unable to calm down.
Could I have a hug?
I found an empty cage.
Take a break, Tom.
What does he want to do?
We're here to play golf.
Why don't you come by sometime?
She wonders how this is possible.
Santa Claus lives on the North Pole.
He was born in Ohio.
Please, go.
Look at that.
Wake up!
You chose the pretty one.
Look at how big it is!
I tried to be nice.
Mary's a wedding planner.
Houston, we had a problem.
Why do you always have to get involved?
I'm having trouble talking about my feelings.
I'll give you anything you want.
That's their book.
Mary came home from school crying because her friends were teasing her.
I'm not sure when Tom will arrive.
You should come home.
Alice laughed.
She can't be bribed.
Do you want to turn off the light?
I'll save you.
I'll let you know.
We can watch Tom in a suit, behind a black big piano with dramatic finger gestures, creating music that is very pleasant to listen to.
Last night, strong winds broke down a lot of branches from the trees.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
We need to prepare the ground for negotiations.
Aren't you supposed to be getting ready for work?
There are 40 students in this class.
They laughed at his mistake.
The way to a man's heart is through his stomach.
Every ship needs a captain.
It's time to get up.
The house is built of brick.
I didn't write this.
I got off at the wrong bus station.
I can't help but feel partially responsible.
People were good to me.
I know this is weird.
Tom's out of sight now.
We should celebrate together.
Tom and Mary are leaving today.
Have you ever tried?
Dr. Jackson has a good relationship with the patient.

Burj Khalifa is currently the tallest skyscraper in the world.
How many blankets are on the bed?
You really don't need to do that.
Why are you so smart?
I'm cooking lunch.
I wonder what Tom is going to do.
I'm fat.
In order to get to the top, you need to be able to read the notes.
Tom was asleep.
They wanted an apology.
Where did I go wrong?
Our school was founded in 1990.
Does that make you angry?
I drink vitamins every day.
I'll call you a little later.
Why me?
Obviously, I was too optimistic.
Tom cooks for us.
We live in the house.
You're not done yet?
You're very uneducated.
He makes good money.
Tom says he's healthy.
I'm the only one here who can do that.
The zoo is closed on Mondays.
That's the point.
Knowledge of foreign languages is useful for everyone.
They don't like to do that.
She let me go.
It is very natural for a human being to always give himself priority over the interests of others.
I'm eating here.
It's all right. It's all right.
Do you think Tom broke the window?
I have a lot of things planned for tomorrow.
I thought it was pathetic.
He was named captain of the football team.
Why are you still awake? You should go to bed.
I was at school yesterday.
Tom does what he's told.
I'm still working.
In some cases, insensitive children may grow up to be sociopaths.
I'd like it to be with you.
The job of the police is to prevent and investigate crime.
Can you give me a remote?
This isn't exactly what I wanted.
After you.
We all work too hard.
I'm Ricardo.
Thank you for everything you've done for us.
I'm not perfect.
Tom learns very quickly.
You're different.
The hatred of others is unknown.
This will make our job a lot easier.
He loves football.
What time can you come?
The monks were able to play tennis in the monasteries.
No one trusts him anymore.
Keep children away from medication.
Who's Tom, is he your new boyfriend?
I was wondering if I might be dreaming.
Everything changes over time.
No one's going anywhere.
The game can be postponed until next week.
I have a soul.
Drive to work for an hour and a half.
That's right.
Your time will come soon.
Tom had no idea I was gonna be there.
This doesn't matter.
Tom's in the warehouse.
I was in Rome.
I'm a natural.
I turned around.
I totally forgot to do that.
Marriage is the main cause of all divorces.
It's right here.
I'll come up with something.
It all started a year ago when he came home.
Play it again, Sam.
Do you drink coffee?
Some of us think that such views are simply insane.
It's working.
Someone could get hurt.
Tom didn't write any letters to Mary until he was there.
We've had enough of you.
You won't be able to stand this job.
We all know it's Tom's fault.
She's Chinese.
I don't drink vodka.
We need to be wise.
I'll be in the back.
Look at these.
He needs it.
Don't forget to extend your passport.
I think Tom got the bigger end.
I bet Tom never talked to you like that.
I've changed.
I care more about you than the future of Japan.
I couldn't help but feel sorry for him.
When I woke up this morning, I felt a slight nausea.
Is that the woman who knows the answer?
We hope Tom's okay.
I've read about a hundred books so far.
I promoted it to the skin.
Come and play with us.
And it was only with great difficulty.
I'll go if you go.
Let's watch TV.
Few people know it exists.
Did you write down the number?
That's not a cause for panic.
I only got 20 points on the math exam.
The worst headaches are caused by under-understood ideas.
I'm really happy to be here.
What are you looking at?
I still don't understand anything.
My mother died the day I got married.
Investigate this.
What's your name?
They try.
My future is in your hands.
He's a liar, isn't he?
Tom has three sons and one daughter.
Tom is cold-blooded.
That's what I'm used to doing.
I met him the day before.
Don't stop.
Please help us find this card.
Can you distinguish silver from tin?
Hands up!
I don't practice as much as I should.
I'm not mad at anyone.
I think that's really important.
She doesn't speak English, let alone French.
It's so sad.
How clever!
You should know better.
In short, I don't agree.
I'm a responsible person.
You're not having fun with anyone, are you?
She's a teacher.
Without water, it is impossible to live.
I used to play the piano a long time ago, so I'm still a little smart.
Is this your cup, or your sister?
The battle lasted a week.
Tom knew what he wanted.
The mother and daughter were two generations old.
We're finally here!
She's in good hands.
He told himself that he had to work two hours a day in the garden.
Apples and pears are offered, not gold and green forests.
I'm resting my legs.
The professor's excuse is almost perfect.
Do you want to learn something specific?
I really like to exercise.
I love you!
I'm really proud of it.
We were in last place.
I contributed.
Is it true that Tom can't read and write?
I can read German, but I can't speak it.
It doesn't look like you.
She has achieved her goal.
I'm twice as old as Tom.
Madness has crossed the line.
Isn't that black?
This isn't a children's book.
You're absolutely right.
Come on, sit next to me.
We know we're better than that.
Like I don't know!
Let's not talk about this now.
Have fun.
It's time to part.
What kind of food do you like to cook?
I was just thinking about you.
I love dogs.
Who are they talking to?
They know you.
He was the son of a wealthy merchant.
The execution of the meeting is ready.
I said I'd wait for you.
She looks good for her age.
What's this?
What are you eating at all?
I don't like being judged.
I have an appointment tonight.
Tom enjoys fishing.
A man's hope as long as he's alive.
Be careful.
Let's discuss the options.
Don't worry, if you help me, everything will be fine.
I was struck by a miracle.
It was a funny movie.
We just saw her.
Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.
I think it's a waste of time.
We're trying.
Why is this our problem?
Tom will take care of this.
Go take a look.
Some of us hate it.
"This came for you." "Uh..." "Well, do you remember the one she sent you when you asked her to take pictures of Applejack's friend's stuff?" "Yes." And then she told you to write a critique of Mecca's physical appearance." "Yes." "Then she sent a critique of Mecca." "Yes, and you said that."
I've always loved horror movies.
Napoleon's horse was white.
People were nice to me.
How did I get over that?
I don't want to take any more of your time.
I only go to church out of respect for my mother.
It is better to live one day as a lion than one hundred years as a sheep.
"Did he explain it?" "Yes."
Not every lamp is magical.
Tom won't be able to answer these questions.
I'll do it with pleasure.
He killed himself.
I was very excited.
You don't have to eat right before you go to bed.
Tom will wait.
What's going to happen now?
I need five more minutes.
The students did not know how to respond.
Shame on you for lying.
I'm not a nocturnal bird.
Did you get the package I sent you?
I'm not a doctor.
My baby wants to talk.
It's good to see you again.
Tom bought me a VIP card.
I'm fat.
I'm the one who has to do it.
Tom's gonna call.
He lit a torch before entering the cave.
I'm not hiding from anyone.
This is such a good place.
I don't live with Tom.
I heard Tom dropped out of college.
Why do you hate me so much?
What am I doing here?
Tom will understand.
These girls are very busy.
Give us some space.
There's truth to what Tom's saying.
You didn't say anything wrong.
I'm sick of your whining.
Get out! Get out!
We have two TVs.
We like to play football.
Make a place.
The horse must have folded and the knight fell off the horse.
I haven't forgotten.
There are islands at sea.
I'm currently researching it.
Mini skirts are fashionable again.
What are we really looking for?
She achieved her goal.
He can do whatever he wants, as far as I'm concerned.
Tom said he needed the money.
Tom was pretty good.
Hurry up!
He couldn't understand much of what they were saying to each other.
This medicine will relieve your headache.
He disappeared without a trace.
Well, leave me alone.
That's what they both like.
We sat together in silence for a while.
You look great.
I'm home.
He never goes by train.
He's addicted to Starbucks coffee.
The book is on the table.
The two sides will hold talks this week.
I'm planning on giving my son a computer at the end of the month.
Cardboard is stronger than paper.
Why did you shave your chin?
Tom is not a good writer.
Fadil changed his mind.
I've never noticed that before.

Tell me about your teacher.

I think we were lucky.
Don't talk.
Do you teach French at your school?
Come have a drink with me.

That usually works.
How did you find Tom's hideout?
Go upstairs.
Can you give me a sign?
I locked the bike.
And now a word from our sponsor.
I'm not at all happy with the situation.

We'll never know the reason.
How are you feeling?
Everyone tells me I'm weird.
Bitcoin and Ethereum are virtual currencies.
It's all very cheap.

It's better now than it used to be.
Tom and Mary are as different as heaven and earth.
Tom asked me for an opinion on who would win the race.
Man has a lot of desires that he actually does not want to fulfill and it would even be wrong to assume the opposite. He wants them to remain only desires, they have value only in his imagination; their fulfillment would be a bitter disappointment for him. One of such desires is and the desire for eternal life. If it was fulfilled, man would become more and more painful than life.
Water is a liquid.
Does Tom really speak French?
I can't trust him.
I'm not a prophet.
I can't fix the car on my own.

I want to live in the city.
Tom and I just wrote a couple of books together.
I think this is the beginning of a wonderful friendship.

No one really wants us.
They all paid.
Be careful.
Yogurt is made from milk and cream.
I'm on my own.
Okay, how about you?
Don't drink the water.
I don't want to ruin your day.
It was just the beginning.
The book is sold out.
The price of gold changes every day.
Be nice.
Look around!
Tom got married.
I could come with you.
Why are you wearing a sweater?
He's a scientist.
You don't have permission to enter that room.
Do you have time to come tomorrow?
Tom hates his little bedroom.
Why is it interesting to take pictures of trains?
I hope you like it.
Welcome back.
He'll be back very soon.
Enjoy it as long as you can!
Tom's a simpleton.
We can't go back.
I'll take a shower.
What are you planning to do this summer?
Do you have any questions?
I know him well.
Can anything be more romantic?
Beethoven wrote nine symphonies.
I'll hurry.
We'll do the job.
It's time for the truth.
It's none of our business.
Do you like costumes?
Why are you asking?
I saw Markus' house.
At least he's honest.
It's really pretty bad.
Thank you all for that.
They wouldn't follow us.
And you, Brutus?
The house where Ataturk was born was in Thessaloniki.
People are wrong.
It's snowing.

Keep digging. Keep digging.
Tom jumped up and down.
Tom's dog was lying down.
Don't talk.
This information is confidential.
You taught us that.
Oh, no.
Go find something else to do.
They're not mine.
I'm ready!
You're not gonna leave me, are you?
Don't overdo it.
I can't approve this project, there's a lot of flaws.
You're sending a message to Mary?
I'll save you a spot in the front row.
Mary is pushing her children to play football.
Have they arrived yet?
Don't forget to return my pen.
Small flowers bloom at night.
I counted to two hundred.
I tried to convince Tom to come home.
One day you should try it.
I'm staying home with my grandmother and grandfather for the weekend.
What's your conclusion?
I prayed for you.
No, that's all.
Come to my house.
Tom's on the edge of his seat.
The bathroom's upstairs.
It's Christmas tomorrow.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Tom cheated on you.
Tom reads a lot.
It's only a few minutes away from here.
What do you know about me?
He wants to work in the hospital.
I'm not saying anything.
I got off the bus.
You're the average student.
As a child, many violent criminals ruthlessly tortured animals.
I'll live in Cambodia.
How long are you going to be angry and yell at us?
Please, stop here.
How much does it really matter?
Shall we have an aperitif?
Tom's always complaining.
If you want, I'll teach you how to play the ukulele.
I'm already used to it.
It's not that bad.
Looks like she was offended by what he said to her.
I love to listen to music written by my friends.
Tom admitted it.
I've been there twice.

Bring some wine.
Things aren't always what they seem.
Show me the pictures!
You need to demolish a few old houses.
What did you do?
I tried to be aggressive.
Tom sneaked in for a party.

When are you going to leave?
This report isn't written very well.
I want a new bike.
She said the government's latest move has multiple meanings.
They say love is blind.

India is the 7th largest country in the world.
How much did you have to pay Tom to get him to clean the snow off the roof?
I'll repay you.
Why is he here?
A student from Oslo who falsified his diploma to enroll in college was sentenced to prison.
Tom knows it's over.
I wish I'd thought of that.
Tom made a vegetarian chili.
I wanted to help you.
You were really good to me.
I'll finish reading this book.
Who are you really?
We all cried a lot.
Did you wash the dishes?
I'll tell you the truth now.
Do I usually look happy?
It's not an essay problem, but all these pernicious questions and explanations of words drive me crazy!
The weekend has arrived.
I'll be back next week.
It looks uncomfortable.
What did you both do?
I really want to see her.
It was a lucky shot.
I thought Tom was amazing.
I've never seen anything like it before.
I buy a lot of things in that store.
Did you receive the package I sent you?
I wish you were here with me.
Try this.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
He began to scream.
I'll be back when I finish my homework.
Clean up a bit.
Can I use your dictionary?
Did you manage to do it yourself?
Don't push.
Can we try this?
Most people like chicken.
Did Tom go crazy?
I didn't do that either.
Are you ready?
Let's look again.
The last time I went to the beach, I got burned.
Back up. Back up.
The city was destroyed during the war.
Watch out here, Tom.
We've repaired some of the damage caused by the rock splashing on your car.
I became a pensioner after forty-five years of working in the office.
Why are you suddenly curious?
His wife didn't give him any support.
I just took a bath.
Do you doubt me?
Luckily, Tom didn't get seriously hurt.
In general, children love sweets.
Tom's gonna cry.
We need your help.
I think we've had enough.
You scared us.
Are you ready for more?
Just try it.
Tom's upstairs.
We'll try your way.
Tom decided to take the day off.
How could I resist?
Gold is much heavier than water.
The phone is a wonderful device.
Tom's afraid of death.
I can't fix the car myself.
One language is never enough.
Most people think I'm crazy.
Tom says this is normal.
This is the address.
Tell me what you wrote.
I'm confident.
I don't believe it.
My mother died the day I got married.
Don't let anyone in!
What would Tom think?
We're not getting into this.
It happens to everyone sooner or later.
This is my question.
Hang on, Tom.
It's definitely got a bigger ending.
Follow me.
I don't care what your name is.
He doesn't have a flat.
It's all right with me.
It's obvious Tom's sick.
I started learning English when I was twelve. At that time I was interested in languages, but not to that extent. Now I speak English, French, Spanish and Portuguese; so, it's time to learn Latin.
We live in a very safe country.
I can't remember the melody of that song.
I'm Ricardo.
I need an honest girl.
She's a beginner.
Are they still there?
I'm sure I'll miss Tom very much.
Tom won't get away.
I'd go.
I don't take bribes.
Down! Down!
Tom couldn't stand it.
Anything you can remember can help.
You'll be better in a few days.
What language do you speak?
That's not something to worry about.
I know they're like you, but that's just a bad thing.
Tom's gonna make it.
There's no free lunch.
And what if I'm gay?
Anyway, he's definitely coming.
Please leave this place as clean as you'd like to find it.
We'll go through the jungle somehow.
Did Tom really move to Boston?
There's only so much we can do.
Friends, can I talk to you for a minute?
That's your life.
What's your name?
I get it.
We're lucky, aren't we?
I'm crying.
I'm sorry.
Stop self-pity.
He'll be finished soon.
You learn by doing.
You'll never walk alone.
Tom's the one you want.
The police are after me.
Have you seen anyone there?
Either way, you're wrong.
She won't take it.
There is no rule without exception.
Maybe you need a shovel.
There are all kinds of flowers in the garden.
Nobody said anything.

He's always unsatisfied.
Music is his passion.
You're supposed to face reality.
Light waves pass through space and various materials.
We managed to escape just in time.
I've had enough of everything.
Tom doesn't fit in here.
Carthage must be destroyed!
How much does it cost?
I want to talk to Tom about it.
We have some options.
It should work.
She hated him.
As far as I'm concerned, I'm not opposed to your opinion.
Isn't that what you wanted?
I could talk to Tom.
It's just what happens.
Here, have a drink.
Who knows what will happen tomorrow?
I've been hungry since my run.
I'm a translator.
It was hot in every sense of the word.
Spider me a goliath.
Talk about others so they'd like to talk about you!
Tom was so confused that he didn't even know what question to ask.
Are you ready?
Find Tom.
It seems OK to me.
Whatever you think?
You changed my life.
Somehow we're going to go through the jungle.
Reaction isn't always the best way to act.
I'm not gonna tell anyone you did it.
Tom asked Mary to take him to the airport.
The Committee recommends that those who have complained should be compensated with a pro rata part of the annual interest-rate compensation.
Tom was buying time.
This is my computer.
It was kind of surreal.
In theory it is possible, but in practice it is very difficult.
I don't have time to write.
It's time to get up.
It was almost worth it.
Please send me your picture.
That's my money, too.
Either way, it's over.
Tom's distracted.
Remember the name of the file before you try to recover the deleted files.
I'm trying to be careful.
Tom ran down the street.
The answer to this question is simple.
Let's get to work.
Only vodka from Russia is a real Russian vodka!

A lot of things go hand in hand.
Tom wants to teach his children the importance of work.
He's always been a pig.

Is it yours?
Tom is one of the best lawyers in Boston.
How much will I get?
How many close friends do you have?
It's happening.
How long do you think Tom's been preparing for the exam?
A book that describes the wonders of nature.
Why are you doing this to yourself?
You don't have to throw stones at a glass house.
I'll scream.
Mary was silent for a moment.
Do you have a dog?
He's out of breath.
I tried to get Tom to come home.
I'd get involved.
You can't touch that.
No, no, no, no, no.
I shouldn't have told Tom to do that.
All future meetings will be held in this room.
Check everyone.
Mary is a retired nurse.
I won't be watching TV tonight.

I don't speak English.
You're not the one who died.
Would you rather have tea?
I'll explain.
I'm too busy at work.
I'm a woman.
Tom asked for help.
It's not like that.
They know you.
I passed every test.
What will you do today?
What's on your mind?
I'll kill you!
I was cold as a syringe.
There's no point just waiting for something to happen; you have to do something right away.
Here's the key to my apartment.
It's an area with a lot of new homes.
I can't believe all this.
I could have gone, but I didn't want to.
Yesterday it was snowing.
We walked through the park.
I was in a great mood.
Tom hid a spare key in his garden.
Let's pretend we're aliens.
I'm sure Tom will win.

Your home, your freedom.
Have you read the Holy Bible?
And if I was rich, I wouldn't give him the money.
Are we safe now?
Stop it!
We've been studying all afternoon.
Are you going to send this as a mail order?
What do you suggest?
It is said that love is blind.
I don't have a home today.
I was just too busy.
Did you talk about me?
The sky was darker and darker.
Watch out!
We did everything we could.
Am I ever wrong?
The room is dark.
Come on, give it to me.
Are you blaming me?
I wish I was pretty.

Where's the vodka?
Tom doesn't have that kind of problem.
You can't keep secrets from me.
It just happened again.
You've got a busy day ahead of you.

I wholeheartedly support your comments.
I'll try to convince Tom to help us.

Did we agree?
It's not that bad.
Let's talk in the hallway.
Can you ask Tom to call me?
We don't know for sure.
Quit smoking.
Tom went over there.
You owe me an apology.
Am I safe now?
Give me the number.
I can't either.
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom used to be afraid of me.
Tom whispered something to Mary and she smiled.
But why?
Can I have a look at your ticket?
What's gonna happen now?
Be careful, the knife is very sharp.

It's obviously a typo.
Your book is twice as big as mine.
We're not both as rich as we'd like.
Tom wouldn't be happy.
Tom has a beautiful garden.
A cup of coffee cleared my head.
Do I have a knife?

You taught us that.
You can't talk to her.
You should probably talk a little slower.
Happy Mother's Day!
I need a beer.
You're not funny.
All Henry's prices.
I thought you were married.
It was a great success.
Sit down, please.
Does that happen often?
A little bird told me.
I couldn't see who it was.

Crazy!
You pay me well.
I'm glad people saw that.
You should talk to me.

Where were you in Japan?
They're all gone.

I'm Tom's grandfather.
And you wonder why we can't stand your company?
The more I know people, the more I admire dogs.
You spelled my name wrong.
You're different.
Tom can't stay.
Shame on her.
I have two cats.
There were about a thousand people.
I already said I don't know how to do it.
His wife did not provide support.
I had dinner with him.
That didn't interest me.
Some of them were and still are in constant danger due to political repression and persecution.

Imagine yourself in my place.
Can you prove that?
We're trying.
I'm quitting.
You let me down.
Tom looked angry.
Don't overdo it.
Oh, yeah, I'll be busy tomorrow.
Nobody cares about me.
So what's the plan now?
I'm sorry.
I haven’t been home all day.
I'd be grateful if you'd stay until tomorrow.
I'm sure they need you.
He's everything, he's just not honest.
The bullet pierced the helmet.
Tom's not a good worker.
I'm here to help.
I'm smart.

Tom is no longer a member of this club.
Show me the pictures!
That helps us a lot.

I thought you wouldn't be able to do that.
We'll just follow you.
Tom asked me not to tell anyone, so I didn't.
Are we coming soon?
I'm not a prophet.
I'm sure you two will agree.
I hope I'm not the only one who's gonna be there.
Are you angry about that?
I'm divorced.
I don't expect Tom to be here today.
This makes me very uncomfortable.
We're from Russia.
Costs will increase soon.
I work at a language school.
Was I really that happy?
Tom might be the one who did it.
That sounds familiar to me.
It's always been like that.
I'll go to sea tomorrow if it's nice.

We have no choice.
Painless is boring.

It's for my friend.
They don't speak English.
We're lost, aren't we?
We're not gonna let you die.
Did you go see Tom?
What's that?
He gave up.
I can't wait forever.
This is the beginning of a new era.
America is one big, friendly dog in a small room, every time he swings his tail, he knocks down a chair.
I don't have a ticket.
The doctor works at the hospital.
Nothing's happened.
I baked an apple pie.
He has a good reputation.
You'll be famous.
You can't sit next to me.
Are you coming soon?
Welcome to Tatoeba.
Everything's different.
What's your Bosnian name?
The truth must be told.
Look at how big it is!
We have to go shopping.
Tom's in the garage, working on his bike.
Is your car blue?
Are Tom and Mary really friends?
Tom wanted to have a bigger boat than his brother.
Tell me what it is.
Let's hope Tom's smart.
He lied to you.
How many mosques are there in Istanbul?
He was late because of the accident.
I always eat fruits and vegetables for breakfast.
Do you think I'm a dictator?
Who would want Tom dead?
Tom has made it clear that he doesn't want to work for us.
I'm happy.
I'll stand.
We suggest that the water quality is checked once a year in pipes, twice in a well.
Dear God, it's really hard for people to have to pay attention to one thing or another about you, your attitudes, or your appearance, for example.
Don't be late.
What did you say?
Tom could have done better.
I'm sure they need you.
I feel like I'm thrown into a big void.
Do you agree?
Don't be afraid of dogs barking.
Are they still there?
Tom hasn't written to Mary in a long time.
This story tells us some interesting facts.
"Yes, orange juice, please," said Mike.
I'm not going with you.
Be careful.
Could I just interrupt you for a second?
I hate science.
The students did not know how to respond.
Do you have a book?
He has two cars.
If you don't mind them, they won't mind you either.
Good intention is important.
I've been thinking about it.
Men remain children all their lives.
Stop trying to make me guilty.
Come on, admit it.
The two of us are so different.
I'll live.
I'm sorry I missed your birthday.
There was nothing to eat.
The girls were asleep.
I'm just looking.
Where is the beach?
You want to know something specific?
You're welcome.
We're not sure.
We don't have any food.
I'm tired.
You don't have to tell me twice.
Interoperability is compatibility with other systems.
I love you, but not like that.
I don't know.
Tom was seriously injured in the accident.
Two-thirds of the students attended the meeting.
My mother is not like other mothers.
He canceled the meeting at the last minute.
That can't be true.
What do women want?
Tom said you were cool.
She received four e-mails.
You open the door.
That's good.
Who's Tom, is that your new boyfriend?
Get dressed.
When did you start writing songs?
I don't know why Tom went to Boston.
Why did you do that?
I hope you're not talking about me.
Don't give me that gun, I don't want to do that.
How did I miss this?
I'm relaxed.
Have you seen my dog?
Tom told me he'd do it.
Look again.
You speak French?
I'm objective.
Nine out of ten voters believe that Maria is the most suitable candidate for the new leader, but Tom will not vote in this election.
I bought some flowers.
I'm sure you'll have a good time.
She came back from the hospital.
I don't want to read Tom's story.
I agreed to buy it.
He asked me to help him.
I'm Tom's grandfather.
What will happen now?
I brought a cup of coffee.
Make a city.
He is also well known in Australia.
Someone called.
Be careful.
Winter is a time of snow.
Under what name?
What are you going to do with Tom?
Good morning, how are you?
It's cold today.
My mother is Greek.
Be careful with your wishes, they may come true for you.
Tom is a third-year student.
Who's going to come with us?
Sounds like you've learned an important lesson.
Who are you really?
How it came about, that's how it went.
Give him time.
Who waits, waits.
I'll have to say, yes.
We've never been apart.
I'm 30.
Give me back my bottle.
I'm really happy to be here.
What the hell is wrong with you?
The doctor examined her thoroughly.
At that moment, it exploded with a big bang.
That's exactly what I said would happen.
Tom knows that more than 91 percent of the Norwegian population is supplied with drinking water from surface sources.
It's his, isn't it?
What's she drinking?
These are artificial tears.
Tom is very naughty.
Don't forget to write the date.
She doesn't speak English.
Clean up this mess.
Could you read that?
Try it again.
That's perfectly normal.
How's your life going?
A new restaurant is said to have been built.
The price of this book is $5.
I want a sword like this.
Do you know how to keep secrets?
Tell her.
I assumed you were busy.
Move it quietly.
When the fire broke out, he slept a lot.
My older sister sings well.
I never thought about it.
Her childhood illness blinded her.
Some friends can't be replaced.
Although the existence of this phenomenon is mere speculation, it is possible that in the future there will be evidence to support it.
Quiet down there.
Tom explained in detail, but I still don't understand.
I'm from Croatia.
I want to eat some cheese.
He wouldn't like that.
I'll have to change my habits.
I met your father yesterday.
I'm really curious.
Are you a man or a woman?
Tom parked twice.
Can you speak Latin?
Will you help me?
Good morning, how are you?
Are you sure you're ready for this?
Come back.
What are you going to do with Tom?
There was nothing to eat.
Everyone has the right to the protection of moral and material interests arising from any scientific, literary or artistic work of which he is the creator.
Tom signed the bill.
There are islands in the sea.
I've never had a problem falling asleep.
Tom is hiding under the table.
I didn't see anything.
How many books can I take at once?
She went out for a walk.
Are there any other options?
The amount for the work done and the interest on the capital invested were several million.
Champagne, please.
I can't wait for tomorrow.
Is coffee good for you?
You never know what will happen tomorrow.
I'm the one who pays.
How many books do you have?
I'll do it myself.
You're sad.
All three of the boys laughed.
We're all tired of this.
I need a drink.
I'm sure Tom had something to do with it.
I don't totally agree with you.
It's a beautiful day today.
Are you keeping this place for someone?
How are you these days?
You're a very beautiful woman.
I really think we women have an extra sense.
Sunday has seven days: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
I wasn't worried about that.
Are you coming to Tom and Merino's wedding?
He asked me to help him.
Croatia is a country in the southeastern part of Europe.
I'll be late.
You're a little liar.
The sea has risen, the sea of men.
I'll send a letter to my brother who lives in Sappore.
The politician had sticky fingers, because 5% of each contract ended up in his pocket.
I'll stay with the baby if you want to go.
I don't read novels.
I thought it was my job.
I'm a professor.
Tom said he wasn't an expert.
No, don't do that.
I asked Tom what he was reading.
There's no reason to panic.
He didn't even hear Tom hate us.
I don't want any beans.
Where do you live?
It's been a long time since I've sent anyone a letter.
What is the difference between imitation and real diamonds?
I don't want to grow up.
Tom turned off the engine.
Tom saw Mary with another man.
I was just thinking about you.
Don't argue.
Did you write a report?
Tom didn't want to talk to Mary, but he didn't have a choice.
Can you leave, Tom?
That man is a soldier.
Do you have Facebook?
American English is no better than British English.
Tom works around nine hours a day.
I hope I can do that.
I told you Tom was busy.
It's fair.
Not everyone could hear what he said.
Why would I want to kill you all?
Tom decided to sell the car.
I'll take a shower.
I'm happy.
It's mine, not his.
We have four hours of French every week.
Let's start right now.
I can't imagine doing that.
I've been training for months.
I know what you're probably thinking.
Fadil demanded that Denmark give him the money.
It's our only hope.
I got up on my left foot today.
He broke into my home.
The bathroom is on the floor.
She took care of her son.
I didn't know you were so rich.
It is a typical gothic church.
It was a presentation that appealed to the public.
Let me show you why you shouldn't do that.
Is this your notebook?
Somehow we survived.
Tom didn't exercise.
Thank you very much!
Hold your cue.
It's fifteen to two.
I think you should do the test again.
Why would Tom surrender?
Europeans gained an advantage over other civilizations 500 years ago.
It seemed to me that Tom was not doing what he was supposed to be doing.
I'll pray for your family.
Tom drove the flies away.
He abruptly stopped smoking.
I can't remember what I ate yesterday.
It's never here in the morning.
Even the kids know that.
Don't make a fool of yourself!
Tom asked Mary to refute the statement.
I have a cat and a dog, the cat is black and the dog is white.
Sarajevo is the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The cup is on the table.
That makes me very angry.
Is it still light out there?
I'm not hiding from anyone.
There's a lot of birds on the line.
I don't have a cell phone anymore.
Don't thank me.
I assumed you were busy.
Do you agree?
Would you like me to look at your house?
You have to control yourself.
What's the difference?
I recognized him at first sight.
The French are our friends.
That's very nice of you.
She looks like a Greek goddess.
You have to trust me.
If I love you, what's the matter with you?
I wish I'd thought of that.
I drink milk.
Tom managed to get into the house through the window.
I saw a cat.
She doesn't speak English.
I saw a cat.
It's snowing in Paris.
I hope he comes back safely.
I have no idea what's going on in his head to reject such a favorable proposal.
I just got up.
How's it feel?
Can you make Tom laugh?
I'd better clean it up now.
You tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go outside and walk.
Don't leave me alone.
Whoa!
I'm sure Tom won't want to do that.
Tom is strict or fair.
Are you free this afternoon?
The three of us had a bowl of potato salad.
Come alone.
To be a good kid, you need to go to bed and get up early.
Okay, how about you?
I'm thinking of going abroad.
I didn't tell you to do that.
Where are you from?
I promised.
My family goes to Italy every year.
It's not an easy sport.
Their friendship quickly turned into love.
Don't be lazy.
That's how it was supposed to be.
I eat a lot of meat.
I don't like working.
Tom's a nerd.
The future looks bleak for Edmond Dantes, having become the victim of a conspiracy, he is convicted of treason and sent to prison for life.
You're being irrational.
My French is shit.
We survived somehow.
She covered her disappointment with a smile.
My mother chose this one.
We're both not as rich as we'd like.
He's slurring.
Can you let Tom know that I've come?
She did what she was told.
I'm bald.
I'll give you the money tomorrow.
You need one of these.
Is he a teacher?
Do you know how to cook?
Tom loves sports.
I learned French myself.
I like to walk.
I think I'm a pretty good writer.
I asked Tom to wake me up at 2:30.
Tom thinks the same way.
That's his weak point.
You're one of us.
Faith can move mountains.
With one foot in the grave
Tom just told me the other way around.
Louder!
He was two years younger than me.
I'm sympathetic.
Tom is unsatisfied.
That would be a pleasure.
It's like crazy power.
I'm sorry I didn't respond to your letter earlier.
Don't drink the water from the dirty glass!
What do you know about me?
I'm reformed.
All the songs I've sung to you today I've written.
That doesn't scare me at all.
We didn't play well.
How old are you really?
Someone's here.
Tom asked me if I had slept at all last night.
Why is love so complicated?
What if I'm wrong?
Tom seemed a little sick.
Here's her picture.
How can I forget those days?
I'm thirsty.
A friend of mine is studying abroad.
I'll contact you as soon as I get there.
Who's your favorite wrestler?
Nice to meet you.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
This place looks very different from what it used to be.
Is it yours?
Why are rabbit ears so big?
I'm a runner.
I don't sing.
Souls do not exist.
I want to help.
I know how to do that.
I shot a bear.
Tom sent his son to bed without dinner.
Tom's a real idiot.
Oh, yeah.
Come and see us.
He lied to us.
That's a pretty big problem.
I'm watching you.
Tom told me not to talk to Mary.
I love this song.
That's very rare.
What did I just do?
It's best to do things on the go.
You work too much, sit down and take a break.
This one's really cool.
No one's talking.
I really enjoyed it.
That can be trusted to some extent.
You're a teacher.
I bought a lot of things.
Would you like another glass of water?
My wife's from Ked.
I'm not the only one who doesn't like Tom.
That helps us a lot.
What do you believe in?
I'm sorry, I'm late for the session.
What we need is a responsible government, what we have is a circus.
I'm sorry I tried at all.
This river looks shallow, doesn't it?
I can keep a secret.
Tom helped me write this composition.
It's five o'clock in the morning in Brazil.
Tom hinted that Mary would do it.
Is this your phone?
We hate Tom.
This one's really cool.
Tom cut the tape.
Do you think the situation will improve?
Who is she?
Tom was arrested three times.
This isn't so much fun.
That's a big secret.
Mary said she would reveal the secrets of all her bosses if they didn't raise her salary.
It is not taught in school.
Is it clean?
I can't get out tonight.
"Will you think about it?" "Yes, I will."
Get out of there.
Fish can't live out of water.
I have a book.
Is any of this true?
I had a vision.
Stop resisting! Stop resisting!
I'm cold.
I'm so busy I can't help you.
I have two colors.
Get up!
Please wait a little longer.
I'm not gonna do that!
I'm tired of arguing.
Are you a maniac?
How was your day?
What am I looking for here?
They're good people.
She's a singer.
I love watching you play.
Every part!
I'm trying.
I was definitely lucky.
What was the first song you ever wrote?
Tom could get carried away.
I just want to stay away.
Dania continued to follow Fadilov’s example.
A large number of words are borrowed from foreign languages.
I don't want you to get hurt.
I'm mad at Tom.
Every other day, Bill goes fishing.
Don't let a chance like this pass you by.
What time do you have breakfast?
Be careful.
He's in his first year of college.
I asked for grape juice.
I was thinking about my family.
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
Can you make Tom laugh?
Due to bad weather, the flight was delayed.
Can I have your dictionary?
My fluency in language is enough for many situations, but not to express my, often contradictory, emotions.
I was in a great mood.
I'm a professor.
There's nothing to do in this town.
Tom's a squire.
Turn around for a second, will you?
The book is on the shelf.
I often feel my heart beating.
Tom's on a secret mission.
I'm not blaming you.
They wanted to punish me.
I'm afraid of snakes.
I know this girl from somewhere.
I climbed it once.
Show me the photos!
She wanted to become a nurse.
I'm sorry I'm always bothering you.
Tom's risking everything.
He's a man of power.
That's wonderful.
I'm flattered.
Can you pick us up?
Can you make it in time?
It's strange that the postman hasn't arrived yet.
Try to do one thing at a time.
How do we prevent that from happening?
His novels are a favorite among young people.
There's a cat.
I hope Tom remembers this.
Was I really that happy?
I'll be buying a boat soon. What insurance should I choose?
Tom said he wouldn't wait for us.
Close your eyes, Tom.
She was surprised to hear the news.
He's not American, he's English.
How do you say “thank you” in Japanese?
There were no injuries.
Have you ever been fined for speeding?
I'll be right up.
We've got to go.
Tom's a mechanic.
His unhappiness taught me a lot.
Are we ready to leave?
- Why?
The storm shouldn't affect our plans.
Tom is a very good boy.
Tom's upstairs.
There are no girls on the internet.
She tried.
My dog is blind, but he likes to go out and walk.
Like most 18-year-olds, Tom isn't sure what he wants to do with his life.
Vivaldi wrote many musical works for the bassoon.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry broke his right thigh bone in a bicycle accident on Sunday in France.
Where there's a lot of grandmothers, there's a lot of kids.
Tom is tense as a string.
Never lose hope.
Sounds simple, I know.
It was just a slap on the cake.
How long has it been since you stopped teaching at that school?
Tom looked very confused.
The results were incredible.
Choose one.
I'm sorry, I didn't remember your name.
The brakes were squeaky.
Have you fully recovered?
He got what he wanted.
I'll listen.
The job's already done.
Tom spoke very loudly.
She drinks like a sucker.
Don't move!
The incident was recorded by an observer.
Did I drop it?
Are you happy?
This is the dumbest thing I've ever said.
I wish I knew that Tom didn't know how to speak French.
Tell them we're coming.
Their friendship has gradually turned into love.
There's a saying in China that you can't judge a man by his looks.
It's in vain.
Florence is the most beautiful city in Italy.
The left side of Tom's house is in Connecticut, and the right side is in New York.
They need each other.
What the fuck is going on here?
There are indications that the reception, which is known for its luxury dishes, will be somewhat more modest this year.
Did you report it to the police?
He surrendered.
Italy is a beautiful country.
What's the matter with you?
You lied to me, didn't you?
I hope Tom does that.
Tom and I were friends.
I hope you and Tom have a good time.
Which way are you going?
I'm sorry if I let you down.
Violent criminals were often rapists in childhood.
Meet me with Tom.
After a long discussion, I ended up doing things at random.
You owe me a lot.
He's a man who saves words.
I'm really sorry about this.
Tom came to my house for dinner yesterday.
Look at how big it is!
The living truth.
You're very unquestioned.
Tom tried to convince Mary not to go.
Now is a great time to buy one.
You're absolutely right.
He knows the names of all his customers.
Tom got out of it.
Tom got involved with people he should never have gotten involved with.
He visits us from time to time.
Tell me what to write and I'll write.
Tom is unforgiving.
Tom was half right.
Tom ran down the street.
That's a problem you have to solve yourself.
I was overreacting.
The termites eat wood.
I take vitamins every day.
Tom dropped the book.
This is supposed to work.
You cheated on me.
You don't have to judge a man by his appearance.
It's unrelated.
Am I in love?
Do you think I missed something?
Thanks for the email!
I pretended I didn't know what was going on.
They'll give speeches tomorrow.
What's this?
My hands are full.
Tom had no idea I was gonna be there.
Tom told me he wouldn't tell Mary what happened.
Don't talk.
The team is as strong as its weakest member.
I've been there before.
Me, too.
It's different than what I expected.
Don't lie.
What are your plans, then?
The kids are asleep.
That was very good.
You need a temporary bridge.
I talked to Tom yesterday.
This town, like many towns in England, has a fairly long history.
Tom closed the door.
I didn't have much fun, so I went home early.
Now it's time for the kids to go to bed.
Where's your stuff?
Tom worked very hard and spent a lot of money.
I don't like to socialize.
Tom's alone in the living room.
He lived a simple life.
We offered to help.
It was a dark and stormy night.
It smells delicious.
The first phase is over.
You'll be famous.
He's got a lot of money, even more.
We're glad to have you here.
Can I have another glass of beer?
Tom was sure of himself.
Sit down for a moment, please.
It's Copacabana!
I wonder how Tom feels.
She takes care of her old mother.
You're the most boring person I know.
Tom knew it was a bad idea.
I've got plants.
I bought a dozen pencils today.
I'm hurt.
Tom stayed with us for a few days.
Is French taught in your school?
That can't be true.
Tom looked left and right before crossing the street.
Take a picture of this.
Who lives in the neighborhood?
Tom was in the audience.
Tom will recover.
It's important to me.
I don't expect anything from you.
Go straight.
Tell her.
I volunteered.
I don't see the difference.
Don't count on it.
I'm used to nobody liking me.
The brakes are squeaking.
Find Tom.
You really made me proud.
You see everything in black.
Just like a bean.
Now I'm a little worried.
Do you have a stable relationship with your boyfriend?
Tom still knows how to recite a song he wrote when he was thirteen.
It's empty.
Did you see that Tom was gone?
Be careful.
How would you translate that for you?
I'm willing to pay you well to do that.
Where did you get that idea?
What are you talking about?
It was a tough decision.
This is from Australia.
I thought you'd be busy.
A lot of people admire him.
I hope tomorrow will be a good time.
Mary nodded.
Let's sit down.
Come and take a look.
Tom really seems familiar.
Trier is the oldest city in Germany.
I'm quitting.
Do your children have their own rooms?
Tom kept all the letters that Mary had sent him.
Go take a swim with Tom.
She's safe.
Tom died in his sleep.
A women's chiffon isn't complete without a little black dress.
I can't sit still.
Finish this.
We have no choice but to kill.
Where's the bathroom?
Happy Easter! <0xE2><0x86><0x92>
Tom helped me save some dinar by telling me about a cheaper place to buy it.
I owe you an apology.
You can't do anything but admire his courage.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
Tom's been working all his life.
Blink!
Which way are you going?
Maybe you shouldn't have told Tom.
I need to fix my watch.
Tom will live.
Please read between the lines.
You won!
That's a bad sign.
I got it all wrong.
Tom had dinner with Mary.
Did you just meet her?
I'm nervous.
My mother died the same day I got married.
Isn't that what you wanted?
Was I really that happy?
I'm good with the kids.
I'll be late.
I was eating at speed.
You can't buy apples anymore!
There's a lot of traffic on the highway.
You should leave a message to Tom.
You always lie to me.
Just in time!
I want to want what you want.
Health is wealth.
Tom now has a family.
That doesn't surprise me.
As far as I know, he never came on time.
Sweet dreams!
Someone needs to hire Tom.
Where did you find the keys?
You'll see her.
You're very rude.
The boy throws a rock.
Can I call you back in 20 minutes?
Wind is a cheap and clean source of energy.
As little as we know about its origin, at least we can be sure that it is a pilot of the Evangelion.
I'm a terrible writer.
Tom got on the bus.
Can you leave us alone?
I almost forgot my passport.
Why are you doing this, if I may ask?
The deer is faster than stronger.
People used to write books with home-made machines.
You can't blame Tom for everything.
I live in Sarajevo.
I reacted instinctively.
It's a toilet.
Tom doesn't see anything wrong with letting Mary learn to drive.
Are you coming back now?
I want to fuck you.
I hope that's not the case.
Give me an example.
How could I hate Tom?
Wear this.
How barbaric!
What's tomorrow?
I always knew that.
Tom thought I was you.
I'm looking forward to your letter.
When there are no cats, the mice cycle.
We need it from Tom.
Japan is ruled by the Emperor and Spain by the King.
It's Alina's book.
Will we see Tom again?
The world was on the brink of nuclear war during the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962.
Have fun while you can.
I'm sure I'll win that tennis match.
Are you dyslexic?
Melanie's drinking milk.
Where did you see Tom?
It's all quiet again.
I'm faithful.
Can we order, please?
What's he doing?
Otherwise, what's your address?
What I saw was depressing.
They were laughing at me.
I'm angry.
Take it easy, Tom.
Can you give an example?
I'm not going to bust with you this weekend.
He stole a very precious diamond ring.
That's my cat.
Tom drinks like a sucker.
Just like the good old days.
Tom knew what he wanted.
Is that what you want?
I'm glad you found the money you lost.
Don't overdo it.
Look at that.
We have your size, but not in that color.
It doesn't look like you.
He's always here between 5 and 6 o'clock.
Tom was admitted to the hospital.
I hope I can do that.
I don't like tough people.
Sitting all day is bad for you.
The rainy season begins in June.
You're always working.
That's perfectly normal.
You're out of luck, Tom.
The wall looked smooth and impenetrable.
Do you hear anything?
He's got two cars.
He'll probably still be angry.
He greeted us and left.
Welcome to Tatoeba.
I look, but I don't see.
Bleeding.
I'm glad you answered.
We are close friends.
We can't be friends anymore.
In the future, many workers will be replaced by robots.
Tom was completely drunk.
I admit I'm wrong.

This one's pretty cool.
