Members of the Welsh Assembly fear they will “look like Mupeti”
Some members of the Welsh Assembly are dismayed by the suggestion that their title should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for the proposal is the plans to change the name of the assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that the name could cause ridicule.
One Labour Party member said his group was concerned that "it rhymes with Twp and Pwp."
For readers outside Wales: in Welsh twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A member for Plaid said the group as a whole was "not happy" and suggested alternatives.
The Welsh Conservative said his group was moving to change the name "with an open mind", but noted that the MWP was close to the word Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced similarly to the letter "u" in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is now preparing legislation to introduce changes to the name, said: "Of course, the final decision on how the members of the Welsh Assembly will be called will be on the members themselves."
The Welsh Government Act 2017 gave the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission published the results of the public consultation on the proposals, where the option to call the Assembly the Welsh Parliament gained wide support.
As for the title of members of the assembly, the commission preferred the name Welsh Parliament Member, or WMP, but the MWP variant gained the most support in public discussion.
Members of the assembly are apparently proposing alternative options, but the fight to reach a consensus may worry President Elin Jones, who is due to table a legislative proposal within a few weeks.
The reform laws will include further changes to the functioning of the assembly, including rules for disqualification of members and a proposal for a system of committees.
Members of the Assembly will vote on the question of their title in the framework of the debate on the new legislation.
Macedonians will vote to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will decide whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The all-out vote is expected to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to Greek territory, and has repeatedly protested the country’s EU and NATO membership requests.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes a plebiscite to change the name, has said he will not be running the vote.
Proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue, however, that the name change is simply a price for joining the EU and NATO.
The bells at St. Martin's will be silenced because the churches in Harlem are fighting for survival.
“The old people I talked to say there was a bar and a church on every corner before,” Mr. Adams says.
“There’s nothing there today.”
The disappearance of the bars is understandable.
"People today relate in a different way," he says.
"Bars are no longer the living quarters of the neighborhood where people regularly walk."
As for the churches, he fears that the money from the sale of property will not be enough for as long as their representatives expect, “and sooner or later they will be exactly where they started.”
As he adds, the churches could be replaced by apartment buildings with apartments full of people of this type, who will not help the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood much.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these houses will be white," he says, "and therefore the day will soon come when these churches will close down completely, because it is unlikely that most of these people who move into the apartments will become members of the churches."
Both churches built white congregations even before Harlem became a black metropolis – the Metropolitan Community in 1870, St. Martin ten years later.
The original White Methodist congregation moved out in the 30s of the 20th century.
The building was taken over by a black congregation, whose devotions were held nearby.
St. Martin took over the black congregation under the leadership of Reverend John Howard Johnson, who was at the head of a boycott of retailers on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping boulevard, who refused to employ or raise blacks.
The fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when the parishioners of Father Johnson planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a bell tower.
The Reverend David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martin's, proudly called the bell game "the bells of the poor".
The expert, who played the bell in July, called it a “cultural treasure” and an “irreplaceable historical instrument”.
This expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the first bell-playing game in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell-playing game at a church in Riverside 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather says there's no substitute for him at St. Martin's.
In the last few months, St. Martin has had a complicated story of architects and builders, some of whom have been called by the laity representatives of the church, others by the episcopal diocese.
In July, the Council of Elders – the governing body of the parish, consisting of lay representatives – sent a letter to the diocese expressing concerns that the diocese would “try to pass the costs” on to the council of elders, even though the hiring of architects and builders, which the diocese did not send, did not.
Some parishioners complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
Shark Injures 13-Year-Old Boy Who Died for Humor in California
According to official reports, the shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred shortly before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy call for help, and then paddled to him with the whole group to help him get out of the water.
Hammel stated that he first considered the call to be the joy of catching lobster, but then "realized he was screaming 'Kiss me!
“Kiss me!”
When Hammel came to the boy, he noticed that "he had a torn entire area of the clavicle."
“I cried out to everyone to come out of the water: ‘There’s a shark in the water!’” adds Hammel.
The boy was transported in critical condition by helicopter to the Children's Hospital Council Hospital in San Diego.
It is not known what kind of shark is behind the attack.
Captain Larry Giles said at a press conference that the shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but was determined not to be a dangerous species.
Giles added that the victim suffered a traumatic injury to the upper body.
Authorities closed 48-hour access to the beach from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas.
Giles noted that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the cosmetics market in the UK
Sainsbury's wants to face the chains of Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with the cosmetic alleys in the style of a department store, where specialized retailers will be available.
As part of the strong <0xC2><0xA3>2.8 billion launch in the UK, which continues to grow as sales of fashion and household goods decline, cosmetics streets will be tested in 11 stores across the country, and if successful, they will expand to other stores next year.
The investment in cosmetics is linked to the supermarket’s quest to find use for shelves that used to be used for televisions, microwaves, and household needs.
Sainsbury’s says it will double the range of cosmetic products to up to 3,000 products and for the first time will also list brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw.
The existing range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees brands will also be given more space thanks to branded places similar to those in stores such as Boots.
The supermarket also re-introduces its Boutique makeup range, so most of the products will be vegan, which young customers are increasingly demanding.
In addition, two Saintsbury’s stores will be testing the fragrance retailer’s Fragrance Shop concession. The first such store was opened last week in Croydon, south London, and another this year will be in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Shopping on the Internet and moving towards daily shopping for a small amount of food in local shops means that supermarkets have to do more to attract people.
Sainsbury’s CEO Mike Coupe says stores will increasingly look like department stores as a chain of supermarkets strives to better offer services and non-food products to fight discount retailers like Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores and also introduced a number of Habitat divisions, which are chains it bought two years ago. This has increased food sales and makes acquisitions even more profitable.
The previous attempt of the supermarket to redecorate the department with a cosmetic and pharmacy assortment ended infamously.
At the beginning of the millennium, Sainsbury’s tested the joint venture with Boots, but the merger ended after a dispute over the distribution of proceeds from the sale of drugs in supermarkets.
The new strategy comes three years after Saintsbury’s sold its 281 pharmacies for <0xC2><0xA3>125 million to Celesio, which owns the Lloyds chain of pharmacies.
Lloyds plans to play its part by adding an extended range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to its four stores.
Sainsbury’s Paul Mills-Hicks, Chief Commercial Officer, said: “We have changed the look and style of streets with cosmetics to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained colleagues, with whom customers will be able to deal.
Our range of brands should satisfy all needs and an attractive environment and a convenient location means that we are now presenting an attractive place to buy cosmetics that are changing the old ways of shopping."
Peter Jones 'angry' after Holly Willoughby quits <0xC2><0xA3>11m contract
Dragons star Den Peter Jones “grows up” after television host Holly Willoughby stepped down from her $11 million contract with his lifestyle brand to focus on new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand of homewear and Truly accessories.
The pair's venture was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old show host announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby angered Dragons star Den Peter Jones by leaving their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute to focus on her new big contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
According to sources, Jones was “angry” when a television star at a tense Tuesday meeting at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that due to new contracts – worth up to <0xC2><0xA3>1.5 million – he would no longer be able to devote enough time to their brand of homewear and accessories.
The venture has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and could double the fortunes of host Willoughby at an estimated <0xC2><0xA3>11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving the brand, Jones left the UK for one of her summer homes.
An unnamed source said: “The ‘Truly’ badge was a top priority for Holly.
It was supposed to be her long-term future, which would secure her a few decades in advance.
Her decision to leave was a complete shock to everyone involved.
On Tuesday, no one could believe what was happening, the launch was so close.
At the headquarters in Marlow there is a full stock of goods ready for sale."
Experts believe that the departure of the host of This Morning, which is one of the most profitable British stars, could cost the company millions due to the fat investment in products from pillows and candles to clothes and household clothes and the possible further delay in the launch of the brand.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby’s mother and husband Dan Baldwin have been close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby founded the True brand with Tara Cappo in 2016, and two-and-a-half-year-old Jones joined as chairman of the board in March.
Couples go on vacation together and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is set to become an M&S brand ambassador and will replace Anta McPartlin in the I'm A Celebrity show on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night: “We will not comment on his business affairs.”
It’s hard work, and then we fell in love.”
He joked about the criticism he gets from journalists for a remark that some consider "unworthy of a president" and for how he speaks positively about the North Korean leader.
Why did President Trump give up so many things?
Trump responded with his ridiculous “voice-over” voice.
"I didn't give up anything."
He noted that after Trump hailed their June first meeting in Singapore as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is interested in another meeting.
But negotiations on the elimination of nuclear weapons are stuck at a dead end.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean diplomat Ri Yong Ho on Saturday told world leaders at the UN General Assembly that North Korea does not see a “adequate response” from the US to its first steps toward disarmament.
Instead, the U.S. is continuing sanctions aimed at increasing pressure.
In his speech, Trump expressed a much more optimistic view.
"We're doing great with North Korea," he said.
“We were on the brink of war with North Korea.
It would cost millions of lives.
We have a great relationship now.”
His efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results – the end of missile tests, aid in the liberation of hostages and the return of the remnants of American troops to their homeland.
And he defended his unusual approach to informing about his relationship with Kim.
“It’s so easy to act like the president, but instead of 10,000 people from the outside trying to get into this crowded arena, we’d have about 200 people standing right here,” Trump said.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia have devastated the island and killed hundreds of people.
In the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs learned that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok has been expelled from their homes, no national disaster has been declared, which is a necessary prerequisite for speeding up international aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases, they have made it very clear that they do not require international assistance, so it is a bit demanding," says Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children is bringing together a team that travels to Palu, it is not yet clear if foreign personnel can work here.
A spokesman for the National Disaster Agency, Mr Sutupo, said Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Paul to see if international organisations would be allowed to help.
Since earthquakes occur very often in Indonesia, the country is still sadly unprepared for Mother Nature’s wrath.
Tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, but this is not common on other parts of the coast.
The loss of human lives was probably contributed by the apparent lack of sirens warning Paul of the tsunami, even though the warning was issued.
Even at the best of times, traveling between many islands in Indonesia is problematic.
And in natural disasters, logistics are even more difficult.
The hospital ship, which anchored in Lombok and helped the victims of the earthquake, is now moving to Paul, but it will take at least three days to get to the site of the new calamity.
Improving Indonesia’s poor infrastructure was the main focus of President Joko Widodo’s election campaign, and the president spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
He will seek re-election next year, but his government is suffering from funding outages.
President Joko is also facing pressure from persistent sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority are adopting a more conservative form of faith.
Street fighting between Christians and Muslims, in which gangs use machetes, bows and arrows and other primitive weapons, has already claimed the lives of more than a thousand people and tens of thousands of people have fled their homes.
See: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool scored a goal against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge scored in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London, saving Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League.
Sturridge received a pass from Xherdan Shaqiri about 27 metres ahead of Chelsea when his team lost 1-0.
He flipped the ball over to the left and fired at a distant stick.
The arrow flew high and headed to the upper right corner of the gate.
The ball eventually skipped the jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and ended up in the net.
“I was just trying to get to the right place to get the ball, and players like Shaq are always playing as far forward as possible, so I wanted to get as much time as possible,” Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kant approaching me, so I didn't think much of it and shot him with one touch."
Chelsea led 1-0 on the goal of Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward sent the belt back to Mate Kovacic, then turned in the middle of the field and sprinted to half Liverpool.
The ball bounced back quickly.
Then he sent the ball through a beautiful alleyway to Hazard's lime.
He fled the defence and ended up on the left with a remote pole next to Alisson Becker from Liverpool.
On Wednesday at 15:00, Liverpool will face a local team in the Champions League group stage at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Thursday at 3pm in London with Videoton in the UEFA Europa League.
The number of victims of the tsunami in Indonesia has increased to 832
As the Indonesian disaster authority said on Sunday morning, the number of victims of the earthquake and tsunami surged to 832.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday, triggered waves up to 6 meters high, and trapped many people in the rubble of collapsed buildings, Sutopo Purwo Nugroh, a spokesman for the office, told a news conference.
The city of Paul, which has a population of more than 380,000, was engulfed in rubble.
Police have arrested a 23-year-old man suspected of molesting a woman.
A woman's body was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside, and police immediately began an investigation into the murder.
A 44-year-old woman with stab wounds was found at 7:55 a.m. on Grayson Mews on John Street and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called on people in the area who had seen or heard something to register.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is only just beginning, but I would like to appeal to anyone who has moved near John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, whose on-board cameras might have recorded something to contact us, because they may have important information for our investigation," he said.
A police spokesman confirmed that the dead woman lived in Birkenhead and the body was found in the building.
This afternoon, friends arrived at the scene who think they know a woman to ask where she was found this morning.
Police said they are investigating and are now informing the victims of the incident.
The taxi driver who lives in Grayson Mews was just trying to get back to his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed into or out of the building.
When he found out what had happened, he was unable to speak.
Residents have now learned that it will take several hours for them to be able to return home.
A police officer told one person that the entire area is now considered a crime scene.
A crying woman appeared on the spot.
He kept saying, “That’s terrible.”
At 2 p.m., two police vans were behind the tape and another was waiting outside.
In the closed area there are a number of police officers who monitor the house.
Anyone with any information can send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or anonymously contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and enter code 247 from September 30.
Cromwell's statue in parliament has recently become a hit due to a dispute over "rewriting history"
His expulsion would be a deserved punishment for the fact that his fanatical Puritan followers in the style of the Taliban destroyed a lot of English cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick’s proposal “foolishness” and “an effort to rewrite history.”
John Goldsmith, Chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: “In the current debate on the removal of statues, it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell in front of Westminster Palace would be one of the goals.
Cromwell did not order or perform an iconoclasm in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell will be sacrificed for the deeds of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century."
The magnificent portrayal of Cromwell, by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is evidence of 19th-century opinion and part of the character's historiography, which many think still deserves to be celebrated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: “Many people consider Cromwell, although somewhat less than at the end of the 19th century, to be a defender of parliament from external pressure, in his case of course from the monarchy.
The accuracy of this interpretation is the subject of constant historical debate.
It is certain that the conflict in the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a well-identifiable figure who represents one side of this divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance."
China's killer pig tore to shreds
According to local media reports, a pig farmer was attacked and killed in a market in southeastern China.
As the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday, a man with only the surname "Yuan" was found dead with a bruised artery in a pool of blood near a market stall in Liou-pchan-shui in Kuei-cho province.
A pig farmer prepares to administer the vaccine to pigs in the spring of 2005 in Si-ning, China's Chingchai Province.
On Wednesday, he and his cousin from the neighbouring province of J<0xC3><0xBC>n-nan reportedly arrived to sell 15 pigs on the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and found that the door to the next hut was open.
According to him, there was a large pig with a mouthful of blood in the manger.
According to the information, a forensic examination confirmed that a 250-kilogram pig had torn the farmer apart.
"The cousin had his legs all bloody and torn," the Guiyang Evening News quoted the cousin, whom he calls "Wu," as saying.
The video from the security camera shows Yuan coming to the market on Thursday at 4.40am to feed his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man did not belong to Yuan or his cousins.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig had been locked up so that no one else could attack it when police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Market officials are reportedly negotiating with Yuan's family for compensation for his death.
Pig attacks on humans are rare, but they have occurred in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts and critically wounded the man.
Ten years ago, a 300kg pig pushed a Welsh farmer to the tractor and was driven away by the farmer’s wife.
After an Oregon farmer ate his pigs in 2012, one farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not aggressive, but the taste of blood can act as a “switch.”
"They're just playing.
They're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect,” he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rain to the southwest of the United States
Hurricane Rosa is forecast to weaken and move over cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
But in the next few days, it will bring flooding rains to northern Mexico and the southwest of the United States.
At 5 a.m. Eastern time, Rosa reached wind speed of 137 km/h, which is a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 620 km southeast of the city of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, over the Pacific Ocean, a low-pressure blizzard forms and moves east to the west coast of the United States. When Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, it will take the form of a tropical storm and begin to push tropical moisture north into the southwestern part of the United States.
In some parts of Mexico, Rosa will bring up to 250 mm of precipitation on Monday.
Tropical moisture then, with the approaching low-pressure blizzard in the next few days, will cause heavy rain in the southwest of the United States.
Rainfalls of 25 to 100 mm locally will cause dangerous flooding, streams of debris and possible landslides in the desert.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause precipitation to approach 50 to 75 mm per hour, particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
In some places in the southwest of the U.S., especially over most of Arizona, 50 to 100 mm of precipitation is expected.
With rapidly deteriorating conditions, due to the scattered nature of tropical rain, flooding can occur.
Due to the danger of tropical rains, it would be very unreasonable to walk into the desert.
Heavy rains can cause canyons to become raging rivers, and thunderstorms will bring local shock winds and flying dust.
The approaching low-pressure blizzard will bring strong local rainfall on some parts of Southern California’s coast.
There may be total precipitation above 13 mm, which could cause smaller streams of debris and slippery roads.
This will be the first rainfall in the region.
On Sunday evenings and Monday mornings, unique tropical excesses will begin to approach Arizona, and on Monday evenings and Tuesdays, rain will increase.
On Tuesday, heavy rain will spread to the Four Corners and will last until Wednesday.
In October, we can expect intense temperature changes across the U.S. as the Arctic begins to cool, but in the tropical zone it will still be quite warm.
This sometimes leads to sharp temperature changes over short distances.
A great example of significant temperature differences is the center of the USA on Sunday.
The difference between Kansas City in Missouri and Omaha in Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines in Iowa is almost 11 degrees Celsius.
In the next few days, they will try again to extend the resounding summer heat.
In most areas of the central and eastern U.S., a warm start to October is expected with temperatures around 27°C from the southern plains to the northeastern part of the U.S.
In New York City on Tuesday it could be 27°C, which is about 6 degrees above average.
Our long-term forecast shows a high probability of above-average temperatures in the east of the USA in the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh’s interview was watched by more than 20 million people
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels Thursday’s eye-catching testimony of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused him of a sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s.
Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, and voters interrupted routine programs with reports of a sudden turnaround on Friday: an agreement brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that the FBI would conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Christine Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee she was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was teasing her at a high school party and trying to undress her.
Kavanaugh said in a statement that he was 100% sure it didn’t happen.
It is likely that the event was watched by more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen.
The company had average coverage on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The numbers for the other stations that broadcast the statements, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting the people who look in the office.
For comparison, it’s a similar number of viewers who watch football matches in the play-off or the Oscars.
The Fox News Channel, whose moderators strongly supported Kavanaugh’s appointment, had the highest viewership of any station when, according to Nielsen, it was watched by an average of 5.69 million viewers throughout the day’s hearing.
The second station was ABC with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reports that CBS had 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million viewers.
Interest continued even after the negotiations had ended.
The main character of Friday's drama was Senator Flake.
After the office of the moderate Republican issued a statement that he would vote for Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras captured him screaming as he was about to take the elevator to a courtroom hearing on Friday morning.
CNN broadcast live how he stood with his eyes closed for a few minutes and let himself be teased.
One woman said, "I'm standing right here in front of you."
"Do you think he's telling the truth?"
He also heard, “You have power, while many women are powerless.”
Flake said his office had issued a statement, and even before the elevator door closed, he added that he would say more at the commission's hearing.
All cable and television networks were later broadcast live when the Judiciary Committee was supposed to vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to vote for the entire Senate.
But Flake said he would only do so if the charges against the candidate were investigated by the FBI within the next week, which was demanded by a minority of Democrats.
Flake was partially persuaded to talk to his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After talking to Coons and several other senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's voice was important because it was clear that without an investigation, Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of being "politicians" about Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of being “politicians” about Britain’s future and undermining national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another interview that was close to the prime minister on the front page, her former foreign minister Boris Johnson attacked her so-called Chequers plan, saying the proposal for Britain and the EU to collect their tariffs from each other was “absolutely pointless.”
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrested Dyteon Simpson, who is suspected of the death of the LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting of 20-year-old LSU player Wayde Sims.
The Baton Rouge police department said Dyteon Simson, 20, was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder.
Authorities have released a video of a confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and according to police, Sims lost his glasses during the match.
According to CBS’s WABF channel, police secured the glasses at the scene and found Simpson’s DNA on them.
According to police, Simpson confessed after questioning that he shot Waydea.
According to the defense, the bail was set at $350,000.
On Friday, the coroner’s office in East Baton Rouge released a preliminary report saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Refugee Police Unit, state police forensics labs, Southern University police, and local citizens for assisting in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Sports Director Joe Alleva thanked local police officers for "singing and seeking justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
A two-meter forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne also played basketball for LSU,
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said on Friday morning that Wayde's death "shaken" the team and "shocked" him.
"That's what you're still afraid of," Wade said.
A volcano boils ash in Mexico City
The ash falling from the Popacatépetl volcano hit the southern quarter of the Mexican capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention on Saturday warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano after the volcano's activity increased and within 24 hours, 183 gas and ash emissions were recorded.
The center watched a series of thunderstorms and tremors.
On social media, images of windshields of cars covered with a thin layer of ash appeared in some neighborhoods of Mexico City, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists noted an increase in the activity of the volcano, located 72 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of the capital. The last earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017 and had a force of 7.1 degrees.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Before the anniversary of the independence vote, police clashed with Catalan separatists
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police and thousands of people took part in a competition demonstration on the occasion of the first anniversary of the independence vote that divided Catalonia.
Regular police officers blocked a group of masked separatists who threw eggs and powder paint at them. The one on the streets, which are usually flooded by tourists, created dark clouds of dust.
Later, clashes broke out, and the police had to use slippers to calm them down.
For several hours, independence groups chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive" in the face of protesting Union supporters who chanted "Long live Spain".
According to the local press, 14 people were slightly injured during the protests.
A year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, but the separatist Catalans celebrate it, tensions in the region seeking independence remain high.
Voters overwhelmingly voted for independence, but turnout was low because opponents of the secession boycotted them.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police in violent clashes across the region tried to stop voting in polling stations.
Pro-independence groups remained outside on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration took place, but she had to choose a different route.
Narcissus Termes, an 80-year-old electrician who took part in a separatist protest with his wife, said he no longer hoped for the prospect of independence for Catalonia.
“Last year we had some of the best moments.
My parents were happy to be able to vote, but now we are in a dead end," he said.
Despite the important, although narrow victory in last December's regional elections, the Catalan pro-independence parties had to fight to keep things going this year. Many of their best-known leaders either went into exile themselves, or are waiting in detention for a referral to the Referendum.
Forty-two-year-old Monter Joan Puig recorded a protest in support of the police on his phone, saying the conflict was fueled by politicians on both sides.
"The situation is increasingly tense," he adds.
Oriol Junqueras, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been awaiting trial since the end of last year, announced on Saturday that he will run for the European Parliament next year.
“Candidacy in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression that we are witnessing from the Spanish government,” he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crash at home
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after the car repeatedly ran into a house in Londonderry.
The event took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said there was damage to the gate and the house itself.
At one point, too, someone might have shot the car out of the bush.
Meng's hit secured Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secured victory
Livingston, who had moved from the lower division, shocked the Rangers and gave Steven Gerrard only the second defeat of 18 games in the role of the club's manager from Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's hit proved decisive when Gary Holt's team reached Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard’s team is yet to win the Premiership this season on the guest pitch and will face the first Hearts team to lose eight points next Sunday.
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the European League on Thursday.
Livingston has extended a series of non-defeat matches in the division to six games, so head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, has not yet experienced a defeat.
Livingston didn't take a chance against the inconspicuous guests
Holt's team was supposed to lead long before the goal, because his straightness caused the Rangers a lot of problems.
Scott Robinson penetrated the defense, but failed in front of the gate, then Alan Lithgow slipped just past Craig Halkett's head in front of the gate.
It was enough for the housewives to watch the Rangers play in front of them, because they knew that they could punish the guests with standard situations.
And so came the key goal.
Against the Rangers, a free kick was ordered and Livingston created a shell, Declan Gallagher and Robinson together sent Mengu, who ran and scored the ball in the middle of the penalty area.
At this stage, the Rangers dominated possession, but the home defense was impenetrable for them and goalkeeper Liam Kelly mostly didn't have much work to do.
The same image of the game was in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to intervene.
Scott Pittman was stopped by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor and Lithgow did not come out of another standard Livingston situation.
The penalty area of Livingston was constantly flown by the centers that the players were constantly cleaning, and two penalty kicks came in vain – after Halkett’s attack on substitute Glenn Middleton and another at hand.
"The phenomenon" from Livingston - analysis
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at Tony Macaroni Arena
Phenomenal performance and result for Livingston.
They were, without exception, excellent and on their way up they still exceed expectations.
Their style of play and the team have hardly changed since their return to the top, but Holt deserves great praise for the way the team has bounced since their arrival.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was huge, leading a well-ordered defense, while Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on standby the whole time.
The Rangers lacked inspiration.
They used to be good under Gerrard, but they no longer meet these standards.
Their end was weak – they only made it home once – and for the Rangers it should be an alarm clock because they are in the middle of the table.
Erdo<0xC4><0x9F>an received a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday (September 29th), the sky was blue and everyone was smiling.
This is the last day of President Erdogan’s controversial visit to Germany, aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They disagreed on a number of issues, including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then headed for Cologne, where he opened a huge new mosque.
In this city is the largest Turkish population outside of Turkey.
Police prevented 25,000 people from meeting outside the mosque for security reasons, but there were many supporters in the area who wanted to see their president.
Hundreds of people were also heard – many of them Kurds – protesting against Erdogan, who condemned his policies and the German government’s decision to welcome him into the country.
The conflicting protests reflect the controversy of the visitor, who was hailed by some German Turks as a hero and cursed by others as an autocrat.
Deptford accident: Cyclist died after collision with car
In London, a cyclist died after a collision with a car.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 a.m. local time near the intersection of Bestwood Street and busy Evelyn Street in Deptford in the southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and soon an ambulance arrived, but the man was dead on the spot.
The death came just months after another cyclist died about a mile and a half from the scene of Saturday's tragedy in an accident on Childers Street when the driver fled the scene.
The Metropolitan Police said police are now trying to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road is closed, buses run on alternate routes and motorists are advised to avoid this area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Guardsmen Injured in Riots
According to the prison office, six guards were injured in high-security riots in a male prison.
The riots broke out at Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire on Sunday around 9:30 a.m. local time and are still ongoing.
To deal with the riots, in which eight prisoners in one wing were involved, specialized guards from the team "Tornado" were called.
The guards suffered minor injuries and were treated on the spot.
A prison service spokesman said: “In order to deal with the ongoing incident at Long Lartin Prison, specially trained prison staff have been deployed.
Six members of staff were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that those responsible will be handed over to the police and can spend longer behind bars.”
There are more than 500 prisoners in Long Lartin Prison, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June, it was announced that the director of the prison had ended up in the hospital after the inmate was attacked.
And last October, security forces were called to the prison because of serious unrest, in which the personnel were attacked by billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens floods in Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City (an area where it is dry, can benefit)
It’s not common for Arizona to be hit by a low-pressure tropical blizzard, but that’s probably what will happen early next week, when the remaining energy of Hurricane Rosa will surpass the desert southwest and bring the risk of flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona for southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including cities such as Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to make a direct trip through Phoenix on Tuesday and bring rain on Monday night.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said on Twitter that “since 1950, only ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm status or pressure below within 320 km of Phoenix!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane another 64 km from the Arizona border.
The latest models of the National Hurricane Center predict rainfall of 50 to 100 mm, in the area of Mogollon Rim in Arizona places up to 150 mm.
In other areas of the desert northwest, including the center of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is likely to fall 25 to 50 mm, with local aggregates up to 100 mm.
For those who are not at risk of flooding, the rain of Russia can be a blessing, because the area has been hit by a drought.
Floods are a very serious matter, but they may help somewhere, because the southwest of the United States has just hit a drought.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least “extreme drought,” the second-highest category.
The path of Hurricane Rosa will first lead to the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still strong with a maximum wind speed of 137 km/h, then on Sunday morning will be 620 km south of Punta Eugenia in Mexico and will move at a speed of 19 km/h to the north.
Then the storm meets the colder waters of the Pacific Ocean, and thus loses its strength.
It is expected to arrive in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening as a tropical storm.
In some parts of Mexico, rainfall will be strong, posing a high risk of flooding.
“In the area from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, total precipitation is expected to be 75 to 150 mm, with a potential of up to 250 mm,” the weather.com server said.
Rosa then travels as a tropical storm through Mexico to the north and arrives at the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, then passes through Arizona and enters South Utah late on Tuesday evening.
"The main risk for Russia or its remnants is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the desert southwest of the United States," the National Hurricane Center said in a statement.
These rains are expected to cause deadly torrential flooding and streams of debris in deserts and landslides in mountainous terrain.
Midsomer Norton Attack: Four Arrested for Attempted Murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man were arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a stabbed 16-year-old boy was found in Somerset.
The injured boy was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton on Saturday at approximately 4:00 a.m. local time.
He was taken to the hospital and his condition is now "stable".
According to police in Avon and Somerset, young men between the ages of 17 and 20 were detained overnight in the Radstock area.
Police are looking for witnesses who could have a record of what happened on their mobile phone.
Trump Says Kavanaugh 'Tested the Wickedness and Anger' of the Democratic Party
“The vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a rejection of the reckless and outrageous tactics of the Democratic Party,” Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh had "experienced the wickedness and anger" of the Democratic Party during the process of his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, where he resolutely and emotionally rejected Christine Blasey Ford’s accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago, when they were teenagers.
Ford has also spoken out on the charges against her.
The president said on Saturday that on that day, “Americans witnessed Kavanaugh’s excellence and quality and courage.”
He told a crowd of his supporters in West Virginia that “the voice confirming Judge Kavanaugh is a confirmation of one of the greatest legal minds of our time, a lawyer who has an outstanding public service on his account.”
The president has indirectly come across Kavanaugh’s nomination when he talks about how important it is for Republicans to take part in mid-term elections.
“Five weeks before one of the most important elections in our lives.
I’m not running, but I’m still on the move,” he said.
"That's why I'm fighting for great candidates everywhere."
Trump said the Democrats had opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
A Republican Party executive adviser told CNN that the first key procedural vote on Kavanaugh’s Senate nomination is expected no later than Friday.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia have killed hundreds of people and the number of victims is still growing
Authorities said on Saturday that after the Indonesian island of Sulawesi was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami, at least 384 people were killed, many of whom were swept away by huge waves that flooded the beaches.
On the beach in Palu on Friday, hundreds of people gathered at the festival, but at dusk, the coast was hit by up to six meters of waves, which killed many people and destroyed everything that stood in their way.
The tsunami wave was preceded by an earthquake of 7.5 degrees.
“When the tsunami threat arose yesterday, people continued to operate on the beach and did not immediately flee, so they fell in waves for the victim,” BNPB spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami wave did not go alone, it took cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground," Nugroho said, adding that before the impact on the coast, the tsunami on the open sea spread at 800 km/h.
He said that some people fled to the trees before the wave and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Mitigation Agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The consequences shook the coastal city on Saturday as well.
The series of earthquakes was felt in an area where 2.4 million people live.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday’s powerful tremors was about 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped during World War II on Hiroshima.
The city lies at the end of long, narrow bays, which could have made the tsunami wave even bigger.
Nugro described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had been destroyed.
He mentioned that the bodies of some of the victims were found buried under rubble of demolished buildings, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugro reported that the number of casualties and damage may be greater on the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is near the epicenter of the earthquake.
According to him, the communication was “completely blocked without any information” from Donggala.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live in the area, adding that its workers and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"It's a tragedy, but it could get much worse," the statement said.
The agency received considerable criticism on Saturday for failing to report that Palu was hit by a tsunami wave, although authorities said the waves came at the time the warning was issued.
On amateur footage shared on social media, they hear a man on the upper floor of a building yell desperately warning people on the street against the approaching tsunami.
Within a few minutes the coast is hit by a water wall that carries away buildings and cars.
Reuters was unable to verify the recording immediately.
Earthquakes and tsunamis caused a large power outage that disrupted communications around Palu, so authorities could only barely coordinate rescue work.
According to the authorities, the army began to send cargo planes with help from Jakarta and other cities, but the evacuated people still necessarily need food and other basic needs.
The airport in the city was reopened only to transport aid and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was due to visit the evacuation centers in Pal on Saturday.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has climbed to more than 800.
That's too bad.
When employees of World Vision from Donggala came to the city of Paul, where employees hid in the shelters of the cells built in the courtyard of the office building, they saw images of destruction along the way, says Mr. Doseba.
"They said they saw a lot of destroyed houses," he adds.
It's too bad.
When relief groups launched a sad disaster relief effort, some of them complained that foreign workers with great experience were not allowed to come to Paul.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can begin to flow to the site of the calamities only when a national disaster zone is declared.
That hasn't happened yet.
"It's still a disaster at the provincial level," said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for Indonesia's Red Cross.
“Once the government says ‘OK, this is a national disaster,’ we can start international aid, but that’s not the case yet.”
When the second night after Friday’s earthquake and tsunami occurred in Paul, the friends and relatives of those who are still missing still hoped that their loved ones would be the miracles that lighten the gloomy stories of natural disasters.
On Saturday, they pulled a little boy out of the canal.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been imprisoned for two days under the rubble next to her mother’s body.
Gendon Subandono, head coach of Indonesia’s paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders at the Asian Games that ended in Indonesia this month.
Another of the people imprisoned at the Roa Roa hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, were his students.
“As a person who has been paragliding for a long time, I have my own emotional burden,” he says.
Mr Gendon described how, in the hours that followed after the paragliding community learned of the collapse of the Roa Roa hotel, he was desperately sending messages via WhatsApp to competitors from Pal, who took part in the beach festival.
But instead of a pair of blue badges, his messages ended with a gray badge.
"I think that means the messages weren't delivered," he says.
Thieves took $26,750 while filling an ATM in Newport on the Levee
According to a press release from the Newport Police Department, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee on Friday morning as they refilled an ATM in Newport on the Levee.
As Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report, the driver of the car emptied the ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to put more money into it.
As he did so, another man “runs out of Brink’s employee” and steals the bag with money to be put into the ATM.
Witnesses said they saw several suspects fleeing the scene, but police did not specify the number of people involved in the incidents.
If you have any information about the identity of the suspects, call the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changed his name to Ye.
He announced the change on Saturday on Twitter, writing: "An entity formally known as Kanye West."
The 43-year-old West has been nicknamed Ye for some time and used the pseudonym as the name of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
In the show, she replaces singer Ariana Grande, who canceled her appearance for "emotional reasons," according to the show's creator.
West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him, in addition to shortening the current professional name.
"In my opinion, 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, where 'you' is," West said earlier this year when speaking to radio host Big Boy about his album.
"So it's you, it's us, it's us.
It has changed from Kanye, which means the one, to just Ye – as a mere reflection of our good, our evil, our confusion, everything.
The album is such a reflection of who we are."
Many other famous rappers have also changed their names.
Sean Combs was known at various times as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator JAY-Z also alternately wrote his name with and without a binder, and in large and small letters.
Mexico’s president has vowed not to use the military against civilians.
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students, newly elected Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged never to use military force against civilians.
Lopez Obrador on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza vowed to “never use the military to oppress the Mexican people.”
At a time when the left-wing student movement was spreading throughout Latin America, on October 2, 1968, soldiers began shooting at people at a peaceful demonstration in the square, killing up to 300 people.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by paying monthly support to those who study, and by opening other free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education draw young people into criminal gangs.
The U.S. should double funding for artificial intelligence
According to AI investor and AI expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple, China is increasingly active in artificial intelligence (AI) and the US should double the amount it spends on research in this area.
The comment comes after various parts of the U.S. government published announcements about AI, even though the U.S. as a whole has no formal strategy for artificial intelligence.
In the meantime, China introduced a plan last year that aims to be a leader in AI innovation by 2030.
“Duplicateing the AI research budget would be a good start given that all other countries are far beyond the U.S. and we are looking for another breakthrough in AI,” Lee says.
Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling funding could double the chance that the next big AI discovery will be made in the US.
Lee, who published his book “The Superpowers of AI: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order” at Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China’s most significant AI companies, Face++.
At Carnegie Mellon University in the 1980s, he worked on an AI system that outperformed the best American player in Othello, and later was a senior research fellow at Microsoft and president of Google’s Chinese branch.
Lee praised previous U.S. government technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency’s Robotic Challenge, and asked when there would be more to help identify new visionaries.
According to Lee, researchers in the U.S. often have to work hard to get government grants.
"Academic excellence is not driven by China, it's by corporations," Lee says.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired the best university experts in recent years to work on artificial intelligence.
According to Lee, changes in immigration policy could also help improve efforts in the field of AI.
“In my opinion, AI PhD holders should be offered green cards automatically,” he says.
The State Council of China released the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan in July 2017.
The Chinese National Science Foundation provides funding to people in academic institutions in a similar way as the National Science Council and other government organizations give money to researchers in the US, but the quality of academic work is worse in China, Lee says.
This year, the U.S. Department of Defense established the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence to involve industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And DARPA announced this month that it is investing $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
As for the NSF Foundation, it now invests more than $100 million a year in AI research.
However, U.S. legislation that wanted to create the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has failed for months.
Macedonians vote in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia," which would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocks requests for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece has a province called Macedonia and claims that the name of the northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory, and therefore vetoed Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on a proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the change weakens the ethnic identity of the majority Slavic population in Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign calling for a boycott has raised doubts about whether at least 50 percent of the voters needed for the referendum to be valid.
The question in the referendum was: "Are you for membership in NATO and the EU with the acceptance of the agreement with Greece?"
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price worth paying for Macedonia, one of the successor countries of the former Yugoslavia, to join organisations such as the EU and NATO.
“I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for young people in Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the roof of the European Union, because this means a safer life for all of us,” says 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska from Skopje.
The referendum is not binding, but enough members of parliament have said they will follow the outcome of the vote.
A change of name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The state election commission said no problems had been reported by 1 p.m.
Voter turnout, however, was only 16 percent compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters eventually cast their votes.
"I went to vote for my children, our place is in Europe," says Gjose Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter from the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko cast their votes in a Macedonian referendum to change the name that would open the country's path to NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepares a small stage and pulls out chairs in front of tents built by people who are boycotting the referendum.
“We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to enter them with our heads held high, not the door for the servants,” says Kavadarkov.
“We are a poor country, but we have our pride.
If they don’t want us as Macedonia, we can turn to others, such as China and Russia, and become part of Eurasian integration.”
Prime Minister Zaev says NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, which has an unemployment rate of more than 20%.
"I think a large majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are for the EU and NATO," Zaev said after the vote.
The “yes” result would be a “confirmation of our future.”
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research, between 30 and 43 percent of voters could take part in the referendum – which is less than the required turnout.
Another survey, conducted by the Macedonian TV station Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents were going to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote yes.
In order for a referendum to be successful, it must be attended by 50 percent plus one voter.
The failure of the referendum would be the first major blow to the pro-Western government’s policy since it came into force last May.
Watch: Sergio Aguero from Manchester City has come for the goal through Brighton’s entire defence
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling managed to defend Brighton on Saturday, securing a 2-0 win for Manchester City at Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
In Aguera's presentation, his goal in the 65th minute looked ridiculously easy.
It all started with a pass that the Argentine striker received in the middle of the field.
He sprinted between the three Brighton defenders and got into the open space.
Aguera was surrounded by four green jerseys.
On the edge of Brighton's penalty area, he bypassed one defender and overran several others.
He found Sterling's next pass on the left.
The English striker hit the ball in the penalty area back to Aguer, who right-handedly overtook Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot to the right of the net.
"Aguero has a foot problem," City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
“We thought he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
And so it was.
We were lucky to get a goal at the time.”
The initial advantage for the Sky Blues in this Premier League match, however, was provided by Sterling.
This goal fell in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in Brighton.
On the left, he sent a beautiful ball to Leroy Sane.
Sane processed the ball and then sent Sterling to a distant pole.
The Sky Blues attacker slammed the ball into the net just before slipping off the pitch.
City will play Tuesday at 12:55 with Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to ruin the joy of the Rockies
When the Nationals were eliminated from the playoff game, there wasn't much reason to re-enter.
But the eternally competitive Scherzer hopes to take the pitcher’s place on Sunday in a game against the Colorado Rockies – but only if the Rockies, who lead the NL West for one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers, have any hope of a playoff.
The Rockies secured at least a wild card 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday night, but they still want to win their first title in the division.
“Even if we don’t play at all, we can at least get started, because the atmosphere here in Denver is amazing and the second team will play with the greatest effort I will experience this year.
Why wouldn’t I want to play it?”
The Nationals have not yet announced who will start on Sunday, but are reportedly bent on pitching Scherzer in such a situation.
For Scherzer, this would be his 34th start, and he would train and pitch on a Sunday when he was usually on leave.
Washington's right-handed pitcher has 18-7 stats this season with 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 shifts.
Trump speaks at a rally in West Virginia
The president spoke indirectly about the situation around his candidate for Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh when he spoke about how important it is for Republicans to take part in mid-term elections.
“In November, everything we’ve been able to do will be at stake.
There are five weeks left in one of the most important choices of our lives.
It’s one of the big, big ones – I’m not running, but we’re still on the move and I’m fighting everywhere for great candidates.”
Trump continued, “You see this horrible, horrible group of Democrats, you see this is happening right now.
And they are determined to take power by any means necessary, you see the wickedness, the revulsion.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to roll over to gain power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we don't give it to them."
According to him, the Democrats opted for “resistance and obstruction.”
"And you've seen it in the last four days," he added, adding that the Democrats are "angry and evil and disgusting and lying."
He mentioned on behalf of the oldest member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which led to a loud squealing of the audience.
“Do you remember her answer?
Did you bring out the document?
Uh, what?
No, no, wait – it was really a bad body language – the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The Labour Party is no longer a diverse current of opinion.
It is intolerant of those who express their opinions.
When Momento activists on my local side voted for my warning, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a number of Labour MPs to be told they are not welcome – because they have honestly said their opinion.
My fellow Member of Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated similarly because she resolutely opposed anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, paradoxically similar issues, on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The announcement of Friday's meeting of the Labour Party in Nottingham East said that "we want the meetings to be accessible and productive."
Most of the eight years that I was a local member of parliament for the Labour Party, the GC meetings on Friday night were exactly like that.
Unfortunately, most meetings are not taking place today, and the promise of a “kinder, kinder” policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated on the Labour side, and every opinion is judged to be acceptable to the leadership of the party.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader. Colleagues, who I thought we had similar political views, all of a sudden expected me to turn 180 degrees and stand up for positions that I would otherwise not agree with – whether it was national security or the EU itself.
Whenever I speak in public – and it doesn’t matter what I say – there’s a tirade of social media pushbacks calling for my appeal, condemning Wednesday’s policy, and telling me I shouldn’t be on the Labour side.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I’m more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the comments directed at me are usually political.
I have respect for the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face the insurgency of sexist or racist insults every day, but will never resign.
One aspect of this era of politics, of which I am most disappointed, is how insults become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The fact is that we are no longer the diverse stream of opinion, and with each proposal to express distrust or change the rules of selection, the party becomes more limited.
For the past two years, I have been advised many times to hold back, not so much, and then “I’ll be fine.”
But that's not why I went into politics.
Ever since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the carelessness of Margaret Thatcher’s government, which had let my general school class literally fall apart, I have tried to fight for better public services for those who need them most – whether as local councillors or ministers.
I’ve never had my politics covered, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been surprised by my political positions and areas in which I disagreed with the current leadership.
To those who supported the proposal on Friday, I would just say that as the country pushes for a Brexit that will damage homes, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the leader of the Labour Party.
However, my main message is not intended for the Moment in Nottingham, but for my constituents, whether they are members of the Labour Party or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of appeal or political pragmatism will deter me from acting as I see fit.
Chris Leslie is a Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 – 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr climbs to the top
The two late fives slightly distorted the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to triumph in this amazingly entertaining match of Tennent's Premiership.
Now they're at the top of the table as the only non-defeat.
In the end, it was an excellent defense and better use of chances, which helped the home team to win, and coach Peter Murchie had the full right to be satisfied.
“We’ve been through a lot in our games and we’re still undefeated, so I have to be happy,” he says.
Melrose’s Robyn Christie says, “All honor to Ayra, they took a better chance than we did.”
Grant Anderson's five in the 14th minute, transformed by Frazier Clim, sent Ayr forward, but a yellow card for Scottish representative Rory Hughes, who was released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to take advantage of the numerical advantage and Jason Baggot won the unconverted five.
Climo increased Ayra's lead by a penalty and then scored and changed the solo attempt exactly in half, so he adjusted to 17-5 for Ayr.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson, transformed by Baggot, reduced the lead by five points.
Then followed a longer delay due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who had left the pitch on stretchers, and when he started playing again, Ayr bounced back thanks to Stafford McDowell's five, which he transformed into Climo.
Ayra's deputy captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and Melrose again used the player extra thanks to Bruce Colvin's unconverted five after a short strong pressure.
The homers returned, however, and when Struan Hutchinson was yellowed for attacking Clima without a ball, MacPherson of the penalty line put the ball behind the advancing maul of Ayra.
Climo changed, again almost from the beginning, after Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong's kick and sent Gregor Henry's wing for the fifth five homers.
Star Still Game launches a new career in hospitality
The star of the series Still Game Ford Kieran seems to be moving into the hospitality industry. It turns out that he was appointed director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor stars as Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC television show, which he writes and stars alongside long-time comedy partner Greg Hemphille.
The pair have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the last series in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to the official register, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the report, but a source in the Scottish Sun newspaper indicated that Kiernan wanted to get involved in a "prosperous restaurant business" in Glasgow.
"The sea is ours": inland Bolivia hopes that the court will reopen the way to the Pacific Ocean
Sailors are patrolling in front of the naval headquarters in La Paz, which is decorated with ropes.
Above the public buildings there is a blue flag in the colour of the ocean.
The naval bases from Lake Titicaca for the Amazon are described by the motto: “The sea is our right.
It is our duty to get it."
Throughout inland Bolivia there is still a vivid memory of the coast that the country lost to Chile in the bloody 19th-century resource war – as well as a desire to re-float the Pacific Ocean.
These desires are perhaps the greatest in a few decades, because Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice, which should fall on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
“Bolivia has the energy, the spirit of unity and peace and, of course, expects a positive result,” said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians will follow the decisions of the MSD on big screens across the country in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will decide in favor of the Bolivian claim that – after many decades of interrupted talks – Chile is obliged to act on the provision of a sovereign access to Bolivia.
Bolivia’s charismatic indigenous president Evo Morales – who has a controversial battle ahead of him for re-election next year – is also very interested in Monday’s decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean," he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe it is unlikely that the court will rule in favor of Bolivia — and even if it did, much would not change.
The United Nations body, based in the Netherlands, has no power to assign Chilean territory to anyone and said it will not determine the outcome of possible talks.
The fact that the MSD’s decision comes just six months after the last arguments were made shows that the case “wasn’t complicated,” says Paz Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the last four years have not only failed to support the Bolivian cause, but perhaps rather derailed it.
“The current Bolivian government has taken over the issues of access to the sea,” Z<0xC3><0xA1>rate says.
He adds that Morales’ offensive rhetoric has weakened all the remaining goodwill of Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will once again begin to act, but after that it will be extremely difficult to hold discussions.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Veltzé, Bolivia’s representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court’s decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, he said, it would bring “an exceptional opportunity to usher in a new era of relations with Chile” and a chance “to end 139 years of disagreements with each other’s benefits.”
Calzadilla also denied that Morales – still one of the most popular presidents in Latin America – would use the issue of the sea as a political Berliner.
"Bolivia will never give up its right to have access to the Pacific Ocean," he added.
“Judgment is an opportunity to find out that we need to deal with the past.”
North Korea says nuclear disarmament won’t happen unless the U.S. can trust it.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never arm its nuclear weapons first if it can't trust Washington
Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to deliver on the promises made at the summit of the leaders of both rivals in Singapore.
His comment comes after it appears that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to restart nuclear diplomacy, which has stalled at a dead end, for more than three months for a Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says he is “planning for hope” that the ongoing US sanctions and opposition to a declaration ending the Korean War could sometimes bring the North to its knees.
Washington is cautious about agreeing to the declaration unless Pyongyang first takes significant steps to disarm it.
Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a second summit.
However, there is widespread skepticism that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning this arsenal, which the country probably sees as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo wants to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows show that the latest trend of huge head coverings will soon arrive in your fashion stores
If you want to expand your hat collection or completely block the sun, your search is over.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of shriveled huge headgears for their spring/summer 2019 collections at a show that captivated everyone at Paris Fashion Week.
Very impractical hats flooded Instagram this summer and these designers sent their exciting creations to the pier.
An exhibition piece by Valentino was an exaggerated beige hat with a wide edge resembling a feather, which flooded the heads of models.
Other oversized accessories were decorated melons, a witch hat and even pineapple – but not designed to warm the head.
Thom Browne also introduced a selection of bizarre masks – and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have sewn lips and resemble Hannibal Lecter rather than high fashion.
One creature resembled diving equipment with snorkels and glasses, while the other looked like a grain of melted ice cream.
And if you continue with a huge fashion – you’re in luck.
Fashion experts predict that huge hats could arrive in fashion stores as well.
The oversized hats come after “La Bomba”, a straw with a half-meter wide cremation, which was worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand behind this very impractical hat, which flooded social media, sent another huge creation to the parade pier – a straw beach bag that is almost as big as the model in the swimsuits that wears it.
A dark orange raffle bag lined with raffle shackles and fitted with a white leather handle was the showpiece of Jacquemuse’s Spring/Summer 2019 La Riviera collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: “I expect big hats and beach bags to show up in fashion stores for next summer – given that the designer has been so successful with them, it would be hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories.”
John Edward: Language skills are a necessity for global citizens
Scottish independent schools have a number of academic successes, and this continues in 2018 with other excellent test results. Individual and group successes in sports, art, music and other community activities only underline this.
The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS) represents more than 30,000 students across Scotland and strives to provide the best possible level of service to its students and parents.
Independent schools prepare their students for further and higher education, the career they choose, and their place as global citizens.
As a sector of education that can design and implement individually tailored school curricula, we observe that modern languages are still popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, “If you talk to a person in a language they understand, it goes straight to their head.
If you talk to him in his own language, it goes straight to his heart.”
It is a significant observation that if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we cannot rely only on English.
The latest results of this year's tests show that languages are at the top of the tables, with no higher level of success than independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who learned a foreign language achieved the best grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools show that the highest grade A reached 72 percent of Mandarin students, 72 percent of German students, 69 percent of French students, and 63 percent of Spanish students.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as important skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Languages as subjects chosen by students are as important in the curricula of independent and other schools as STEM subjects (science, technology, technical fields and mathematics).
A survey conducted by the UK’s Employment and Skills Commission in 2014 showed that, for reasons that employers cite as problems in filling vacancies, 17 percent of them do not have sufficient language skills.
Therefore, language skills are increasingly becoming a necessity in preparing young people for their future careers.
As more and more job opportunities require languages, these skills are a necessity in a globalised world.
Whatever career you choose, if you have learned a second language, you will have the real advantage in the future that you have such a lifelong skill.
Thanks to the ability to communicate directly with people from foreign countries, a person who speaks multiple languages will automatically gain an advantage over the competition.
According to a survey conducted by YouGov in 2013 among 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent of them were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to conduct a conversation, with the only language spoken by a two-digit percentage of people, specifically 15%, being French.
That is why it is important for today’s children to invest in language learning.
If children learn more languages, especially languages of developing economies, they will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, every school is different in the way it teaches languages.
A number of schools focus on more classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered the most important for the UK in view of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever the child is interested in, he will always have in independent schools a choice of several languages with teachers who are experts in the field.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future holds.
At the moment, it cannot be denied that languages are essential to the country’s future in a global business environment, so this must be reflected in education.
In fact, modern languages should be considered “international communication skills.”
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice, diversity and excellence.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron will perform in the Lakers for the first time on Sunday in San Diego.
Fans who are looking forward to LeBron James joining the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time are looking forward to it soon.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in Sunday's opening game of the San Diego preseason against the Denver Nuggets.
It is not yet clear how many minutes he will play.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48," Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play only a limited number of minutes.
Last week after training, James was asked about his plans for six Lakers games in the preseason.
"At this stage of my career, I don't need pre-season games," he said.
Trump's speech in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will launch a wave of campaign speeches tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It’s the first of five rallies scheduled for next week, including stops at friendly venues such as Tennessee and Mississippi.
Given the suspension of the vote on the confirmation of his candidate for a vacant seat in the Supreme Court, Trump wants to gain support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans face the risk of losing Congress in the November election.
What time does Trump’s speech start tonight and how can you watch him online?
The Trump rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump’s rally in West Virginia online below via live YouTube feed.
Trump is likely to talk about hearing the candidate in the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh, which took place this week and was very tense due to accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior. The Senate confirmation vote is expected to be delayed by a week before the FBI investigation takes place.
But the main goal of this wave of rallies is to help Republicans gain momentum ahead of the November election.
According to Reuters, Trump’s campaign organizers say the five gatherings next week are aimed at “energizing volunteers and supporters so that Republicans can try to protect and expand the majority they have in the Senate and House of Representatives.”
"Control of the Senate is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible in this busy campaign season," Trump's campaign spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News radio station, supporters from “Ohia and Pennsylvania” could come to the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling today’s rally and be followed by the Pittsburgh media.
On Saturday, it will be the second time in the last month that Trump will visit West Virginia, in which he earned more than 40 percent points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is lagging behind in the polls.
“It’s not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to help him with his research,” said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at the University of West Virginia.
2018 Ryder Cup: U.S. Team Shows It Has Stomach Fight to Keep Hope Ahead of Sunday Singles
After three one-sided games, Saturday’s pairings could be exactly what the Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum is a completely invented sports concept, but players really believe in it, and most of all in such competitions.
So where's the pendulum going now?
"They led by six points and now it's four, so we take it that the pendulum is probably moving a little towards us," Jordan Spieth said at the end of the day.
Of course, Europe has an advantage, it leads by four points and there are still twelve.
As Spieth says, Americans feel they have a little wind in their sails, and there are many things that can encourage them, such as the form of Spiethe and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and everyone can boast three points out of four.
Spieth was fatal in his transition from the field to the green, and he sets an example.
Glorious screams intensified as he continued his lap as he managed to get the key to win the entire game when they were two holes behind with Tomas.
His putt, which won them a 15-hole game, met with a similar cry that tells you the American team isn’t out yet.
"You really had to go deep and take care of your own game," Spieth said.
That's all that each of these players left behind.
18 holes to leave a trace.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, arguably the main story of the Ryder Cup.
Strange, but adorable couple from Europe are four out of four and do nothing wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only couple who didn't hit the pit on Saturday afternoon, but passed on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon, and again on Friday morning.
The course and the way in which the energy flows both towards the stormy audience and from it confirms that these are the players destined for Sunday’s victory, and that by sunset over Le Golf National there will be no more favorite player than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's best to put them both in a different hole at the same time.
However, the talk of European fame remains premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly collaborated with Sergi Garc<0xC3><0xAD>a, the hero of the morning four-ball game, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The pits and two ravines at the front nine buried the Spaniards and the Swedes in a chasm from which they no longer climbed.
No one will help you on Sunday.
Games of two pairs on two balls are so fascinating when you closely follow the interactions of people in a couple, the advice they give, the advice they don’t give, and the way in which the strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has so far played better as a team and has taken a significant lead to the last day, but this game of two pairs also showed that the US team has a stomach for the fight, which some, especially from the states, doubted.
To the final day of the Ryder Cup, Europe leads with a score of 10-6 points
Europe will gain a healthy advantage until the last day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's doubles games with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired by the duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who allegedly won almost twice over the struggling Tiger Woods, they decided to make four innings at Le Golf National.
The European side with Thomas Bjorn, who decided two years ago to keep the trophy they lost at Hazeltine, dominated in the morning games on two balls with the American side, which failed in the series 3-1.
The U.S. showed more resistance in four, won two games, but could not get into the deficit.
Jim Fury's side need eight points from Sunday's 12 games to keep the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were nicknamed "Molliwood" after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points out of their four opening games in Ryder Cup history.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the two-ball game, they beat the tired Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau even more strongly 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday, showed occasional glimmers of brilliance, but has now lost 19 of his 29 games in a pair game to two balls and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, rested after a morning game on two balls, returned to partner Henrik Stenson in a pair game on the 2&1 defeat of Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - 1st and 3rd in the world rankings.
But Europe did not have it on this pleasant, fresh day south-west of Paris, won on the whole line.
Three-time main winner Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas scored two points for the Americans on Saturday.
They won a rough 2&1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in a two-ball game and later returned to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in a pair game, despite losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup does the team return from a four-point deficit to a two-game draw, although as a defender Furyk's side only needs a draw to win the trophy.
After the second day was the best in two days, it seems that the Sunday counterattack is behind them.
North Korea says it won't "under any circumstances" arm itself unilaterally and without confidence
North Korea’s foreign minister said on Saturday that continued U.N. sanctions had deepened their mistrust of the United States, and under such circumstances the country would never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told his annual general assembly that North Korea had taken “significant goodwill measures” in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site, and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
“We don’t see a proper response from the United States,” he said.
“Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances it is not possible to disarm unilaterally.”
While Ri reiterated North Korea’s well-known complaints about Washington’s opposition to the “gradual” approach to denuclearization, according to which North Korea would be rewarded for every step of the way, his statement appeared to be significant in that it did not reject unilateral denuclearization because it was so insistent on denuclearization.
Ri mentioned a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work on “denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,” while Trump pledged to ensure North Korea’s security.
North Korea is seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 war, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for the release of tough international sanctions against North Korea.
“The United States insists on ‘denuclearization first,’ and increases the pressure on sanctions to enforce their goals, and even opposes ‘declaration of the end of the war,’” Ri said.
“The idea that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of people who know nothing about us.
The problem, however, is that continued sanctions deepen our mistrust.”
Ri made no mention of the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the U.S. leader stressed at the United Nations earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, adding: “If South Korea were to side with denuclearization, not the US, then the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have come to such a standstill.”
However, the tone of Ri’s speech was dramatically different from last year’s when he told the UN General Assembly that targeting North Korea’s missiles on U.S. soil was inevitable after “Mr. Evil President” Trump called Kim a “rocket man” on a suicide mission.
Trump, who threatened North Korea’s “total annihilation” last year at the United Nations, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much work still needs to be done and the sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is fully denuclearized.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame, saying, “If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn’t matter.”
China and Russia say the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the measures it has taken.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that “the enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and non-stop until we become aware of complete, final, verified denuclearization.”
The Security Council has unanimously supported sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an effort to curb funding for Pyongyang’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo and Ri met at the U.N. General Assembly and Pompeo said he would visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip did not end well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said progress had been made only to be told by North Korea in a matter of hours that he was making “gangster demands.”
North Korea has pledged to meet with Moon this month to dismantle the missile range and also the nuclear complex if the United States takes “appropriate action.”
He said Kim had told him that the "appropriate measures" he hoped were security guarantees Trump had promised in Singapore and were aimed at normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take part in a course designed to teach them enough rest
A new course at Harvard University this year has prompted all of its students to sleep more, in an effort to fight the growing culture of macho studies all night long when students are not sleeping and encouraged with caffeine.
Academics have found that students at the world’s most famous university are often helpless when it comes to the basics of self-care.
The course was designed by Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham Hospital and Women’s Hospital, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after he lectured on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
“At the end, a girl came up to me and said, ‘Why are you just telling me this now, in my last year?’
She said no one ever told her about the importance of sleep — which surprised me," he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was introduced for the first time this year, explains to students basic information about how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance and improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university’s health services, said the university decided to introduce a course after finding that students were really, really sleepless during the week.
The hourly course includes a number of interactive tasks.
In one part is a picture of student dormitories where students click on cups of coffee, curtains, sneakers and books about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by lack of sleep and the importance of proper sleep habits.
In another section, participants are informed about how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to think about their daily routine.
“We know that the behavior of students will not change immediately.
However, we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking cigarettes," added Professor Czeisler.
A culture of pride in “studying all night” still exists, he added, adding that modern technology and ever-increasing pressure on students mean that the problem of lack of sleep is also growing.
Getting enough quality sleep should be a student’s “secret weapon” to fight stress, exhaustion, and anxiety, he said — even to prevent it from happening because sleep deprivation switches the brain into starvation mode, so a person is still hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student in chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design a course that one of his classes took last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said the course opened his eyes and inspired him to push the whole course.
He hopes that the next step will be to ask all postgraduate students to complete a similar degree program before entering a competitive institution.
The professor advised students to consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed, as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of “blue light” emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can disrupt your circadian rhythm, leading to trouble falling asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Goal Menga sunk Gerrard's men
The Rangers suffered another loss when Dolly Mengy's hit solidified Steven Gerrard's unhappiness with a 1-0 defeat at Livingston.
Ibrox tried to score their first win at St Johnstone from 4 to 1 February, but Gary Holt's team only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager to leave his post eight points from leading Ladbrokes Premiership Hearts.
Menga hit seven minutes before halftime and the Rangers seemed uninspiring and determined to make up for it.
While the Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and immediately behind the Hibernian team in contrast to one goal.
And there could be other problems with Rangers after the line referee Calum Spence had to be treated with a head injury after he was apparently hit by an object from the vantage point.
Gerrard made eight changes to his side, which overtook Ayr in the semifinals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt went with the same Livi 11, who picked up a Hearts point last week and would be delighted as his well-trained team strangled their opponents at every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered possession, but Livingston did more with the ball on their side.
They were supposed to score just two minutes after the start when Menga first dropped Scott Pittman on Allan McGregor's goal, but the backman buried his big shot.
Keaghan Jacobs then found Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only bite at the rear post.
The Rangers took control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in the last third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that he should have a penalty for a quarter-hour mark when they clashed with Steven Lawless, but referee Steven Thomson threw the Colombian challenge off the table.
The Rangers managed only two shots to the goal in the first half, but former goalkeeper Ibrox Liam Kelly was surprised by Lassana Coulibaly's header and Ovie Ejaria's short shot.
While Livi’s opener could have been against the game after 34 minutes, no one can deny that they deserved it for the run.
The Rangers again failed to deal with Jacobs' deep set.
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was calm and got Menga to an easy finish.
Gerrard took action during the break and traded Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the exchange had an almost immediate result when the wing crashed into Morelos, but the imposing Kelly broke through the line and blocked the attack.
But Livingston continued to draw visitors into the game of exactly the kind that they liked when Lithgow and Halkett hit one long ball after another.
Holt's side could have deepened their lead in the final stages, but McGregor stood up well to block Jacobs before Litgow ran out of the corner.
Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton had another late claim to the penalty when he messed up with Jacobs, but Thomson turned away again.
Almanach: Inventor of the Geiger counter
And now the page from our Sunday morning almanac: September 30, 1882, today it is 136 years old, and still increasing... the day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to a device known as the Geiger counter.
Geiger Counter science has also become a staple of pop culture, as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What the hell is that?"
Rogers: “It’s a Geiger counter that’s used to locate radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you put on these headphones, you can really hear the effects of atoms emitted by radioactivity in minerals.
Evans: "Well, it's really cracking now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New Cancer Vaccine May Teach Immune System to ‘See’ Dangerous Cells
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to ‘see’ dangerous cells and kill them
Vaccine Teaches Immune System to Recognize Dangerous Cells as Part of Treatment
The method includes the extraction of immune cells from the patient and their transformation in the laboratory
Then they can “see” the protein that is common to many cancers, and then re-inject the rivet.
The trial vaccine shows promising results in patients with multiple types of cancer.
A woman treated with a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize dangerous cells has been missing ovarian cancer for more than 18 months.
The method involves the extraction of immune cells from the patient, their transformation in the laboratory, so they can “see” the protein common to many cancers called HER2 and then be re-applied to the cell.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: “Our results suggest that we have developed a very promising vaccine.”
HER2 “directs the growth of several types of cancer,” including breast, ovarian, lung, and colorectal cancer, Prof. Berzofsky explained.
A similar approach, in which immune cells were removed from patients and “taught” to focus on cancer cells, was already being promoted in the treatment of leukemia.
Kanye West attended a pro-Trump sermon, in his magic hat, after his performance on SNL.
It didn't go very well
Kanye West was booed at Saturday Night Live after a bewildered performance in which he praised U.S. President Donald Trump and said he would run in 2020.
After singing the third song that night called Ghost Town, in which he wore the Make America Great Again hat, he began spitting on Democrats and repeated his support for President Trump.
“I often talk to white people and they say, ‘How can you like Trump, he’s a racist?’
“If I had any problem with racism, I wouldn’t have been in America a long time ago,” he said.
SNL kicked off a show of parody with Matte Damon in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on charges of raping Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's theatrical speech was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to make West laugh.
West also complained to the audience that his head ornaments had been eaten in the background.
“I was bullied behind the scenes.
They said, "Don't go in there with that hat."
That's bullshit!
They also said I was in the wrong place,” he told the Washington Examiner.
West continued, “Do you want to see the wrong place?” and added that he would “put on his Superman suit because it means you can’t say what to do.” Do you want the world to move forward?
Try love."
His comments only earned the audience’s buzzing at least twice, and members of the SNL looked embarrassed, says Variety, and one person even said, “The whole studio is completely silent.”
West was invited as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West confused many present by singing the song I Love disguised as a bottle of Perrier water.
West received support from TPUSA’s lead conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: “To one of the bravest characters: THANK YOU FOR MAKING DAVA.”
But guest talk show host Karen Hunter wrote on Twitter that West "was just who he is, and that's absolutely amazing."
“But I don’t want to reward someone (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his ‘arts’) who I believe represents and broadcasts to the world an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free.
Just like us," she added.
Before the performance, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said he was now "formally known as Kanye West".
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
A fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly called Snoop Lion and of course the late musical legend Prince, changed his name to the symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Accusations of attempted murder in Belfast

The defendant is scheduled to appear in court in Belfast on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the State Attorney's Office.
Game Thrones star Kit Harington has embarked on a toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is known for his role as Jon Snow with a sword in hand in the violent medieval fantasy HBO series.
However, the 31-year-old actor stepped out of the stereotype of macho heroes and said that such roles on the screen mean that young boys often feel they have to be assertive to earn respect.
He told The Sunday Times Culture Kit that he believes “something is wrong” and asked how to solve the toxic masculinity problem in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Star of Thrones star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he is “quite strong” on the issue.
"Right now, I personally feel, quite strongly - what's wrong with masculinity?" he said.
"What do we teach teenage men about the problem we're seeing here now?"
Kit believes that television can be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its very male characters.
He continued: “What is innate and what is learned?
What do boys learn on television, on the streets, from them, growing the feeling that it is necessary for every man to have such a page?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time - how to change it?
Because young men have certainly changed something for the worse.
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not play in any prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series is over, because he already has enough "fights and horses".
From November, Kit will play Sam Shepard in the restored Right West, which is the story of the film producer and his brother, the robber.
The actor recently revealed that meeting his current wife Rose for the best that came out of Game of Thrones.
“I met my wife on the set of the series, so she gave me my future family and my whole subsequent life,” he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love object of Kit’s character Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple got married in June 2018 on the grounds of Leslie’s family home in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% increase in the number of its citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
According to official figures, more than 820,000 people are affected by the virus.
In the second quarter of 2018, approximately 40,000 new cases were reported.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted by sex, which meant a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV spreads across parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
The number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 annually.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in the Chinese LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reportedly still widespread.
Given the country’s conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Many of the transmissions of the disease come from lack of sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised a universal approach to HIV treatment as part of an effort to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff would let the GOP senators’ data escape, citing the terms “dangerous lies” and “conspiracy theories.”
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that a member of her staff sent personal data of three Republican U.S. senators to lawmakers' wiki pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed the accusations were supported by “ultra-right” scientists and websites.
"Lies, lies and other despicable lies," Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The release reportedly included home addresses and phone numbers for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday and was published by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on charges of sexual abuse by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leaks came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh at one point.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have announced that the IP address that is the source of the posts is linked to Waters’ office and has released information about Waters’ staff members, Hill says.
“This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false and an absolute lie,” Waters continued.
"A member of my staff - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations - was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This unsubstantiated claim is absolutely false and an absolute lie.”
Waters' statement quickly earned online criticism, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry," Fleischer wrote.
"That means he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress."
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they can't be angry.
He can't be resistant.
He must not question the applicant's motives.
He has to be calm and not get excited.”
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, whom they criticized for appearing too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate who campaigned against Waters, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"If it were true, it would be something," he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had alerted “the relevant authorities and authorities active in criminal proceedings to these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed," she continued, "and that they are legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to everyone and all members of my staff."
Johnny English Hits Reviews Again – Weakened Espionage Parody by Rowan Atkinson
It is already common to look for Brexit in every new film with a British trend, which seems to be the case of this revival of Johnny English in a series of action parodies - which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will this bold satire on how obviously bad a nation we are, our new export opportunity?
In any case, this cheeky, incompetent, rubber-faced Johnny English had his license to pack things up again in a whole new way - that name more than anything else by signaling that it was a broad comic piece intended for a non-English-speaking cinematic audience.
He is, of course, the stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour, has a little bit of Inspector Clouseau, a pinch of Mr. Bean and a great temptress of the guy who set the only tone in the tune of Chariots of Fire at the 2012 London Olympics.
The character is also originally based on a traveler and an international mystery man who Atkinson once played in the already forgotten Barclaycard television commercials, and who left chaos behind.
In this last edition of JE you will find one or two nice moments.
I loved Johnny English as he approached the helicopter in medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly squinted at his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humor feels quite undersized and strangely superfluous, especially when "serious" film labels like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves are now offering comedy as a certain component of their production.
Humor is more like being directed at children than adults, and for me, Johnny English’s crazy trampolines are as inventive and focused as Atkinson’s silent film gags in Mr. Bean’s person.
A persistently current assumption is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain's super-secret web network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents in the field, to the dismay of an agent in the service - a role too small for Kevin Eldon.
It’s the last straw for a prime minister who’s a pompous and enthralling figure who’s already suffering from a complete collapse of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson is playing the best of Theresa May’s character, but there’s not much in the script.
Her intelligence advisers inform her that as soon as her active spy is threatened, she will have to return someone from retirement to work.
This means that Johnny English himself, who is now employed as a director in some luxury facility, but at the same time gives a record lesson on how to be a secret agent: here are a few nice gags, because English offers a spy academy similar to the School of Rock.
English returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and met with his long-suffering ex-partner Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man who lives with the submarine commander, an affectionate character who may be a bit wasted on Vicki Pepperdine's talent.
So Batman and Robin are back in action, packing up tasks for Her Majesty's Secret Service, and they meet beautiful femme fatale Ophelia Bullet, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer crimes: the villainous Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their odyssey full of frazzled patalias: masquerading as waiters sets fire to a French restaurant; creates chaos when they sneak aboard Volta's luxury yachts; and English launches pure anarchy when he tries to use virtual reality to get to know the interior of the Volto domus.
All the aces are certainly ready for this last sequence, but no matter how kind and stormy it is, it has something of a children's TV in it.
It's a pretty moderate thing.
And like Johnny English’s other films, I couldn’t help but think: Can’t the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really matches his talent?
Labour denies they would develop a plan for the English to work four days a week to get paid in five days
Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour Party is to consider a radical plan in which the British will work four days a week and get paid for five.
The party reportedly wants the bosses of the companies to pass on to the workers the savings that will result from the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still receive the same reward.
Sources say the idea would “fit” into the party’s economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favor of workers.
The transition to a four-day work week was approved by the Trade Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of changing economies.
A long-time Labour member told the Sunday Times: “It is expected that an evaluation of this measure will be announced by the end of the year.
It won’t happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a wish that fits into the party’s attitudes toward balancing the economy for the benefit of the worker and the party’s overall industrial strategy.”
The Labour Party will not be the first to support such an idea, the Green Party promised a four-day work week during its general election campaign in 2017.
However, this aspiration is not currently endorsed by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: “The four-day work week is not our party’s policy and the party does not take it into account.”
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used a working conference last week to fulfill his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to return energy from “anonymous directors” and “experts” in utility companies.
The shadow chancellor’s plans also mean that current shareholders in water companies don’t have to return to their overall stake, as the Labour government could make “collisions” on the basis of perceived guilt.
He also confirmed plans to place workers on company boards and create equity funds that will transfer 10% of private enterprise equity to employees who are entitled to pay annual dividends of up to <0xC2><0xA3>500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy said on “60 Minutes” whether FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI’s investigation into the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh delayed the last vote on his appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and raises the question of whether finding the office could swing some Republican senators to campaign for their support.
In an interview from Sunday's "60 Minutes," correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI could reveal anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy looked more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course," Kennedy said.
"I said I went to the hearing, I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him when it happened, when the accusation came out, and he said, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, determined, clear."
Graham's decision, however, is unshakable.
"I've already made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh, and that would be a really explosive charge," he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know one thing: Brett denied it harshly," Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And none of the people she named could verify that.
It's been 36 years.
I don’t see anything changing.”
What is Global Citizen Festival and what did it do to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, the annual Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York, offering a very impressive array of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty.
In its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will welcome tens of thousands of people who will meet in Central Park to enjoy not only artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the real purpose of the event, which is the end of extreme poverty by the year 20.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty project, an international group to support ending poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To be able to get a free ticket to an event (if you weren’t willing to pay for a VIP ticket), visitors had to complete a series of tasks or “actions” such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending the scam.
But how successful was Global Citizen now 12 years before it achieved its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really the way to convince them to demand action, or is it just another case of so-called “clicktivism” – people who feel that signing an online petition or sending a tweet will change something?
Global Citizen says that since 2011, it has seen more than 19 million “actions” from its supporters, trying to achieve various goals.
He says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and measures worth more than $37 billion that are expected to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group announced 390 commitments and announcements resulting from its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been paid or funded.
The group estimates that the secured funds have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include the Power of Nutrition project, a British partnership of investors and developers who have committed to “helping children grow to their full potential”, promising to provide Rwanda with $35 million to help end malnutrition in the region after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Ci.
“With the support of the British government, donors, national governments and Global Citizens, like you, we can only make a note of social injustice in the form of malnutrition in history,” Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the U.K. to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most common questions on their website with the question, “Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?”
The global citizen replied, “It’s going to be a long and hard road – sometimes we fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and the anti-apartheid movement, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mon<0xC3><0xA1>e are among the performers at this year’s New York City show, which will host Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
U.S. could use navy for 'blockade' to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
Washington can resort to the Navy “if necessary” to prevent Russian energy from entering markets including the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke revealed, according to the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria - particularly where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
“I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to mediate energy as well as in Eastern Europe, in the southern belly of Europe,” he said.
And according to the official statement, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the opportunity, with the help of our navy, to make sure that sea lanes are open and, if necessary, blocked, to make sure that their energy is not directed to the market," he said.
Zinke addressed participants in an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that is seen in the U.S. as “the voice of the energy consumer.”
He compared Washington’s approach to the negotiations with Russia and Iran, noting that they are practically the same.
"The economic option for Iran and Russia is to invest more or less in or replace fuels," he said, citing Russia as a "single-purpose" player with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy.
The statement comes as the Trump administration is on a mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and has replaced Russia, which is a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To this end, Trump administration officials, including U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to back down from the “inappropriate” Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin “captives” of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is designed to double the existing capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington’s fierce opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for pressure development and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers," Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The United States took a stand from Germany, which reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany’s largest industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industry (BDI), has urged the US to avoid EU energy policies and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supplies," Dieter Kempf, head of the German Federation of Industry (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren vows to “look closely” at 2020 presidential candidacy, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that after midterm elections, she would "look closely" at her candidacy for president.
During a town hall meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed she was considering a candidacy.
“It’s time for women to come to Washington and fix our broken government, including the top female position,” she said.
“After November 6th, I’ll take a closer look at the presidential candidacy.”
Warren also mentioned Donald Trump during the meeting and said she was “leading this country in the wrong direction.”
“I’m scared to the core of what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy,” she said.
Warren was open in her criticism of Trump and his appointment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren said on Twitter: “Of course we need an FBI investigation before the vote.”
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters don’t think she should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "probable" voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run, according to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent would support the candidacy.
The poll showed greater support for the candidacy of former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent for the candidacy and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed in connection with the potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially decide in January, according to the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin mentions PTSD Track Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent one year in Iraq after being added to the list in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
“What my own son is going through, what he’s going through after his return, may relate to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries our troops are coming back with,” she told the audience at a meeting with Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest “an elephant in the room” and said of her son and other war veterans that “someone else is coming back, some are coming back, they’re coming back, they’re coming back, and they’re asking if there’s any respect for the things that their fellow soldiers and airmen are doing, and every other member of their team is doing.”
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, interfering with a domestic violence report, and possession of a gun in a drunken state, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla's police department.
18 states, D.C. supports call for new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to new U.S. government measures that deny asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the Washington district issued a brief message on Friday to support asylum seekers and challenge the measure, NBC said.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against federal policy was not disclosed.
She said her partner "and his sons and members of the violent gang" abused her, but U.S. officials turned her down on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State attorneys supporting Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce large numbers of asylum seekers in the U.S., as nations facing ubiquitous problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the U.S. Immigration Appeals Board that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Attorney General Karl Racine of D.C. said in a statement on Friday that the new measure “ignores decades of state, federal and international law.”
“Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the specific facts and circumstances of the application, and such an obstacle violates this principle,” the brief friend said.
Lawyers also briefly argued that a policy that denies immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy and says they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and “do the necessary work.”
Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered immigration judges not to grant asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence in June.
“Asylum is available to those who leave their home country for persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or because of political opinion,” Sessions said in a June 11 statement.
Asylum has never been aimed at alleviating all the problems — not even all the serious problems — that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue attempts in Pal, where the number of victims has already doubled, race to find survivors over time
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse and worse.
"It's very tense," said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was comforting her feverish boy at an evacuation center in the parched city of Palu.
“Every minute the ambulance brings in more bodies.
“Clean water is rare.”
The inhabitants have been seen returning to their ruined homes, picking themselves up through the soaked things and trying to save whatever they find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals, which were destroyed by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake, were crippled.
Some of the injuries, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a fractured spine and shoulder, rested at Palu's Army Hospital, where patients were treated outside for continuing severe subsequent shocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he portrayed the feeling that a violent earthquake shook the hotel room on the fifth floor, which shared a room with his wife and daughter.
“There was no time to be saved.
I think I’ve been dragged into a wall collapse,” Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
“I heard my wife calling for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
Maybe they're all right."
U.S. ambassador accuses China of ‘bullying’ with propaganda ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in an American newspaper devoted to the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday mentioned a paid China Daily surcharge on the Des Moines Register - the state's biggest selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6.
Trump’s accusation that Beijing was trying to meddle in the U.S. election signaled what U.S. officials said was a new phase in Washington’s escalating campaign to exert pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise in support of trade, Beijing and Washington are currently stuck in an escalating trade war, which manifests itself at the level of mutual imports.
China’s retaliatory sanctions at the start of the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump’s Republican Party, Chinese and U.S. experts said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing had hurt U.S. workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote in an op-ed in Sunday’s Des Moines Register that China is now doubling this bullying by publishing propaganda ads in our own free press.
“In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using America’s valuable tradition of free speech and free press by placing paid advertising in the Des Moines Register,” Branstad wrote.
“In contrast, in a newspaper stand on the street in Beijing, you will find limited dissenting voices and you will not see any real reflection of the disparate views that the Chinese might have on China’s worrying economic trajectory, given that the media belongs to the “Chinese Communist Party” company.
He added that "one of the most important Chinese newspapers refused to publish" his article, although he did not say which newspaper.
Republicans leave their electorates ahead of elections over Kavanaugh's debacle, analysts warn
As many top Republicans defend a candidate for Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who faces several sexual assault charges, the analyst warned that during the upcoming midterm elections, they will hear back, especially from women.
Emotions around the case were extremely high and most Republicans on record are already saying they want to continue voting.
These things cannot be brought back," said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University.
Reeher said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) would be enough to reassure voters at the last minute to pursue an FBI investigation.
"Women won't forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November," Karine Jean-Pierre, lead consultant and spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, told the D.C. newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted “November is coming!” at a demonstration in the Senate Hall where Republicans, who are in charge of the Judiciary Committee, decided to name Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic said.
“Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will break records,” said Stu Rothenberg, an impartial political analyst.
"People say it's already been high, that's true."
But it could be higher, especially among hesitant female voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who don’t like the president but often don’t go to the polls.”
Even before Ford’s public testimony detailing her allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court candidate, analysts suggested that if Republicans confirmed it, it could follow resistance.
“There was a confused mess for the GOP,” Michael Steele, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee, said earlier this week, according to NBC News.
“It’s not just about the vote in committee or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh will sit on the chair, it’s also about how the Republicans handled it and how they handled it,” said Guy Cecil, the U.S. director of priorities, a group that helps elect Democrats.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided in their opinion of who to trust in the light of Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony, with somewhat more sympathy for the other named.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or likely believed Ford’s testimony, while 35 percent said they certainly or likely believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh likely or certainly lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford, as well as at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian said.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee under oath last week that Kavanaugh had assaulted her drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the Supreme Court candidate showed her her genitals at a party during her studies at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet and ahead of Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of technological legend, Inrupt, is a company that builds on the Open source platform of Berners-Lee called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to the information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company Berners-Lee joked that the goal of the Inrupt project is "world domination."
"We have to do it now," he said of the startup.
"It's a historic moment."
The application uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own “personal online data storage” or POD.
It can contain contact lists, task lists, calendar, music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It’s like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are available in one browser and all at the same time.
What is exceptional about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to determine who will have access to what kind of information.
The company calls this “personal empowerment through data.”
According to John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, the purpose of the project is to bring resources, processes and relevant skills to help the Solid platform be available to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, some employees working on the project have collaborated on the project and the community of volunteer programmers.
As of this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team with Facebook and Google are not talking about introducing a complete change where all of their business models are turned upside down overnight.
"We don't ask for their permission."
Berners-Lee wrote in a media post on Saturday that Inrupt’s mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem that will help protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based website.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the discussion of net neutrality.
Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
“I’m incredibly optimistic for this next era of the web,” Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of the clergyman who received the Victoria Cross during the First World War
Celebrations have been held for hundreds of years since the sole spiritual Church of England won the Victoria Cross as a warrior during the First World War.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Four days later, however, he was killed by a sniper and he never found out that he had won the highest British military award.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone to him on Saturday at a ceremonial procession in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was “genius symbolic” that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after his grandfather’s triumphant act.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lt Col Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin with a very thick fog and a strong shot from field guns and machine guns.
He later made it to the front line, and with "the utmost courage" led the line forward, before throwing himself into the field of fire and knocking down three separate units.
Lieutenant Colonel Vanna was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said his grandfather’s actions were “something I could never do, but at the same time something that was humiliating.”
Together with his brother Dr. James Vann, they laid the wreath after the show, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he “felt a great honor to be able to participate in the show,” adding that “the courage of a true hero is demonstrated by the support that a lot of people will give.”
MMA fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, instead getting Peppa Pig
Imagine, you’ve been waiting all night to watch the booby-trapped Bellator 206, only to be denied the main event.
The San José ticket contained 13 points, including six on the main card, and the live broadcast took place in the UK all night on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for a match, viewers in the UK were amazed when newscasts turned into a show about Peppa Pig.
Some remained unsatisfied after waking up until the early hours of the morning to watch the game.
One of the fans on Twitter described the change in the broadcast to the children's show as "a certain form of bad joke."
“According to the government’s order, such content is not appropriate at 6 a.m. and it is therefore necessary to broadcast children’s shows,” said Dave Schwartz, Bellator’s senior vice president of marketing and communications, after being asked about the broadcast.
"Peppa Pig," yes.
Bellator President Scott Coker said they would work on the programme so that viewers in the UK would be involved in the future.
"I think when I think about broadcasting, we can probably handle it," Cooker said.
"But there's six o'clock on Sunday morning and we can't make it to Sunday of our time, Monday of their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program changed, there were a lot of textbooks going back and forth and not all of them were exactly friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't, the government could have done it.
I promise you, it won't happen next time.
We reduced it to five games instead of six – as we normally do – and we tried our best to keep the promise to the fans and we failed.
It's an unfortunate situation."
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley Feels ‘Less’ Due to Sexuality
Olympic water jumper Tom Daley says he grew up with a sense of inferiority to everyone because of his sexuality – but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete said he didn’t realize until he entered high school that “not everyone is like him.”
On the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc, introduced by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out loudly about gay rights to give others "hope."
He also said that he was less interested in winning the Olympics due to the possibility of becoming a parent.
Kirsty Young, a regular host of the long-running show, was on sick leave for several months.
Daley, who appeared as a carpenter in Laverne's first program, said he felt "less valuable" than anyone else who grew up with him because "it wasn't socially unacceptable for you guys and girls to like each other."
He said, “Until now, these feelings of inferiority and otherness were real things that gave me the strength and power to succeed.”
He wanted to prove that “Someone” was, he said, not to disappoint anyone who might find out what his sexuality was like.
A double holder of a bronze Olympic medal has become a fighter for the rights of the high-profile LGBT movement and has used his presence at this year’s Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences and wanted to give others “hope.”
This three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man – the American film director Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 – “took him unprepared.”
Daley married an Oscar winner who is 20 years older last year, but said the age difference was never a problem.
“When you experience so much at such a young age — at his first Olympics when he was 14 and his father died three years later of cancer — he said it wasn’t easy to find someone the same age who experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple adopted Robert Ray Black-Daley's son in June and Daley said he had "changed the whole angle of view".
“If you asked me last year, it would be like, ‘I want to win a gold medal,’” he said.
“You know, there are bigger things than the Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie."
His son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn’t settle for dying, and the last thing he asked was if they already had tickets to the London Olympics in 2012 because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him - you won't be in the first place, Dad," he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and the moment he stopped breathing and was dead, I finally realized he was invincible," he said.
A year later, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
“I knew I’d been dreaming about it my whole life – jumping in front of our home team at the Olympics, I don’t know how I felt better,” he said.
This also inspired the selection of his first song – “Courd” by Heather Small – which resonated with him at the start of the Olympics and still evoked goosebumps in him.
Desert Island Discs airs on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, who was out of form, finished on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson would reach a record on Sunday when he played 47 games in the Ryder Cup, but he would have to adjust his form to prevent it from being an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played at events held every two years for a record twelve, was sent by Captain Jim Furyk at Saturday's fourballs and foursomes on the bench.
Instead of being at the center of events, as was often the case in the U.S., the five-time major winner spent his day alternately between cheerleaders and working on a game in a row that he hoped would fix what was troubling him.
This 48-year-old player has never been the most straightforward of drivers, even at the peak of his career, so he is not an ideal choice for the narrow Le Golf National course, where a long, articulated course routinely punishes stray shots.
And if the golf course itself isn’t worrying enough, Mickelson faces the exact champion of the British Open, Frances Molinari, who won all four of his games this week with rookie Tommy Fleetwood.
If the Americans, who had four points less, started 12 separate swords, escaped a quick start, Mickelson's sword could prove to be absolutely essential.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man and did not add anything else.
"He totally understands the role he played today, patted me on the back, put his hand around my shoulder and said he'll be ready tomorrow," Furyk said.
"They believe so much.
He is a member of the Chamber of Deputies and has been so helpful to these teams in the past week.
I don't think I could have imagined he'd play two swords.
I imagined more, but that's how it evolved, and we thought we had to go this way.
He wants to participate, just like everyone else.”
Mickelson will beat Nick Fald's record in most of the Ryder Cup West games on Sunday.
It could mean the end of his career in the Ryder Cup, which never reached the height of his individual record.
Mickelson scored 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk says his presence on the team has brought some intangible results.
“He’s funny, sarcastic, funny, he likes to make people laugh and he’s a great companion in the team room,” he explained.
“I think the younger players also enjoyed the fun when they went after him this week, which was fun to watch.
It’s much more than just a game.”
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows big leadership may soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a great leader heading into the singles of the last few days in the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dane made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where the team led by Captain Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but reached the finish line with a tight 141<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2-131<0xE2><0x81><0x84>2 victory.
“You have to keep in mind that we had a big lead in Valderrama, as well as in Brooklin, where we lost, and in Valderrama, where we won, but only closely,” Bjorn said, in the picture, after watching how they won 5-3 in the 2018 season on Friday and 10 yesterday at the National Golf Club.
So history and every member of that team has shown me that it's not behind us.
You'll be bored tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
It's not behind you until all the points are on the board.
We have a goal and that is to try to win the trophy and that is what we are focused on.
I said I would focus on 12 players on our side, but we also know what to face on the other side – the best players in the world.”
Bjorn, delighted with the way his players were playing on a complex golf course, added: “I would never have done it myself.
There's another animal waiting for us tomorrow.
Individual performances are being prepared tomorrow, and that is too difficult.
It’s great to be outside with your partner when it’s going well, but when you’re there to be yourself, your golfer’s capacity is fully tested.
This is the message you have to pass on to the players, to get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now you leave your partner behind and he has to go and get the best out of himself too.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will take care of his players to play better as individuals than as partners. The exceptions are Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk was personally on both sides of these great upheavals when he was part of the winning team at Brooklin, to then end up defeated when Europe achieved the "Miracle in the Medina".
"I remember every damn word," he answered when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 captain, encouraged his players to aim for the final day.
“We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you would like to start as fast as in Brooklyn, as in Medinah.
When this pace goes in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those midfield matches.
So we set the record up and made sure the boys feel like you know, like we're supposed to be magic tomorrow."
Thomas was given the task of trying to lead the counterattack and confront Rory McIlroy in a top-flight game with players: Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, who are the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
“I went with that group of boys in this order because I think it covers the whole way,” Bjorn said of his selection of singles.
Germany's New Warship Delayed Again
Germany’s newest frigate was recognized in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but it won’t be available for at least another year due to faulty systems and a snowy coast, local media say.
The commissioning of the leading ship "Rheinland-Pfalz", a completely new frigate of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to the newspaper Die Zeit quoting a spokesman of the army.
The ship was supposed to become part of the Navy in 2014, but difficult problems after delivery have upset the fate of this ambitious project.
As a replacement for the ageing Bremen-class frigates, four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class vessels were ordered by the Navy in 2007.
It is obvious that they will be equipped with a powerful cannon, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship ballistic missiles and certain hidden technologies such as reduced radar and infrared and acoustic elements.
Other important features include a long maintenance period – it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside the home port.
However, the constant delays mean that top-of-the-line naval ships – which were supposed to allow Germany to send forces overseas – will be out of date by the time of commissioning, Die Zeit notes.
The notorious F125 frigate got into the news last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the vessel into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned the ship to the manufacturers after handing it over.
Little was known about the reasons for the return, but the German media cited a number of key "software bugs and defects on metal elements" faults that would render the warship unusable when deployed.
The software flaws were particularly significant, as the Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg class vessel would be operated by a crew of some 120 sailors – half the staff needed on Bremen class frigates.
It has also been shown that the ship is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the Navy’s ability to add future innovations.
It is believed that the 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate ship will be twice as heavy as the class-class ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defects in metal elements, the cost of the entire project – including crew training – is also a problem.
It is said that from the original 2.2 billion euros, the price climbed to a staggering 3.1 billion euros.
The problems with the latest frigates have gained importance especially in light of recent warnings that German naval power is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the defence committee of the German parliament, confirmed that the navy is indeed “coming ships capable of deployment.”
This representative stated that the problems had been continuously compounded because the old ships had been decommissioned but no replacements had been provided.
He lamented that none of the frigates of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class was able to become part of the equipment of the navy.
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats
A new study is being conducted at the Scottish Highlands habitat of bats to discover how bats use the landscape to hunt for food.
There is hope that the findings of the research will shed new light on the behavior of unique flying mammals and help manage future activities for the conservation of this species.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow bats whistling and the smallest and brown-long and aquatic in the Inverewe Gardens botanical garden in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed in key areas of this bat habitat, which will monitor bat activity throughout the year.
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using hand-held detectors.
Professional sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of calls of bats and what individual species are doing.
Subsequently, a habitat map and a report will be issued, which will create a detailed landscape image of their behavior.
Rob Dewar, natural resource conservation advisor for NTS, hopes the results will show which habitat areas are most important to bats and how individual species are using them.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as the creation of meadows, and the best practices in maintaining forested areas for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the whole of Great Britain has been declining significantly in the last century.
They are endangered as a result of the construction and territorial development that affect the colonies and the natural environment.
The risk can also be wind turbines and lighting, as well as fly traps and chemical treatment of building materials as well as cat attacks.
In fact, bats are not blind.
However, because they hunt at night, their ears are more useful than their eyes in prey hunting.
They use an ingenious echo-location technique to track bugs and obstacles in flight.
NTS, responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land in the country, takes bats very seriously.
It has trained experts who regularly carry out surveys, colony checks and sometimes rescue work as well.
This organization even established the first and only dedicated bat reservation at the Threeave headquarters in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight out of ten species of bats in Scotland.
City manager David Thompson says it’s the perfect location for them.
"Here at Threave, we have a great area for bats," he said.
“We have old buildings, lots of ancient trees and the best habitats.
But there’s still too much we don’t know about bats, so the work we do here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive.”
It highlights the importance of controlling bats before the start of maintenance work in real estate, because it is possible that the unconscious destruction of one mother nest can kill up to 400 females and cubs, which can destroy the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass, disrupt or destroy their colonies.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish representative of the Bat Conservation Trust, encourages the public to lend a hand and help.
She said, "We have a lot to learn about our bats and a lot of species that we don't know how their populations are doing."
Ronaldo Rejects Rape Charges and His Lawyers Are Going to Sue German Magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations “fake news” and said people “want to be visible” by using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which has reported on these accusations.
This Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorgy in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep the case quiet, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
A few hours after the indictment was released, Ronaldo, 33, spoke to his 142 million followers in a live video on Instagram, calling the information “fake news.”
“No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news," the five-time Golden Ball award winner said to the camera.
“They want to live in my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous when they say my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm happy and I'm fine," the player said with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronald's lawyers are going to charge Der Spiegel with unsubstantiated charges, which they called an "inadmissible notification of suspicion in the private sector."
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for "moral damage in the amount of the corresponding gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times."
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at the nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the casino, where, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada, he allegedly sexually assaulted her.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo knelt down after the alleged incident and told her that he was "99 percent" "slave" and "one percent" disappointed.
The documents allege that Ronaldo confirmed that he paid for the sex, but that he was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs of her injuries taken at the hospital, but later agreed to extrajudicial treatment because she was "fearful of retaliation" and feared "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old woman says she is now seeking retrial because she is still traumatized by the alleged incident.
At the time of the charge of attacking steps from the transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United and this summer it was bought by the famous Italian club Juve for 100 million euros.
Brexit: The UK will regret the loss of car manufacturers forever
Britain "will regret forever" if it loses its status as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, said company secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston plant, near Derby.
"A deal is necessary," Clark said.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of a delay at the borders if no Brexit deal is signed could cost jobs.
At the plant in Burnaston, where Toyota’s Auris and Avensis cars are produced – last year they produced almost 150,000 cars, 90% of which were exported to other European Union countries.
“My view is that if Britain suddenly left the EU at the end of March, we would have seen production stop at our factory,” said Marvin Cooke, chief executive of Toyota in Burnaston.
Other automakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover in the UK, are spreading fears of leaving the EU without a deal on how cross-border trade works.
BMW, for example, says it will close its Mini car manufacturing plant in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concerns relate to what manufacturers refer to as risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota’s production line is in operation on a ‘just-in-time’ delivery basis, with parts delivered from suppliers in the UK and the EU for cars made to order within 37 minutes.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be a breach at the border, which, according to the industry, could lead to delays and shortages of spare parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to have more than one day’s stock at the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and thus production would stop.
Mr Clark said Theresa May’s plans to rekindle future relations with the EU were “precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.”
"We want to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not only the current success, but also the capture of this opportunity," he told BBC Radio 4's Today.
“The evidence not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that we need to be absolutely able to continue what is a highly successful set of supply chains.”
Toyota has not been able to say how long production will be halted, but in the long run it warns that the added costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately be at the expense of jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has been working at Burnaston for 24 years and is the union president at the plant, said that members of the union are becoming increasingly concerned: “I have the experience that once these places are gone, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: “We have put in place a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.”
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House says
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s high-level meeting with acting attorney general Rod Rosenstein could be “delayed for another week” as the fight for the post of Supreme Court Justice with Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates interference in the Russian election, ties between Trump’s associates and Russia, and possible judicial obstruction by the president.
Whether Trump releases a deputy attorney general and threatens Mueller’s independence, the Washington taps have been satiating for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was discussing wearing a camera to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
On Monday, however, he arrived at the White House surrounded by reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, which was at the United Nations headquarters in New York at the time.
Trump said he would not "rather" let Rosenstein go, but then the meeting was delayed to avoid colluding with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were testifying.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Kavanaugh’s allegations, delaying the Senate’s full vote again.
Trump’s press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared in Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about her meeting with Rosenstein, she said: “No date has been set yet, it could be this week, it may need to be postponed for another week in view of everything else that is going on in the Supreme Court.
But we will see and always communicate the current information to the media."
Some reporters disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a press conference with the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said too few press conferences were caused by an aversion to the “theatre” of television reporters, even though she said, “I don’t agree with the fact that they’re going out.”
She then suggested that the number of direct contacts between Trump and the press would increase.
"The president has more questions and answers than any president before him," she added, without giving any evidence. "We looked at the numbers."
The conference will continue to be held, Sanders said, but “if press representatives had the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it would undoubtedly be better than talking to me.
We're testing it, and you've seen that we've been doing it for the past few weeks, and that there's going to be a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States."
Trump regularly accepts questions when he leaves the White House or attends open meetings or press conferences with visiting senior officials.
Separate press conferences are a rarity.
This week in New York, the president has probably shown why with his relaxed and sometimes bizarre appearance in front of assembled reporters.
The Minister of Health writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland not to be afraid of Brexit
The Minister of Health has written to EU staff working in the Scottish NHS to express their gratitude and wish to remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman sent a letter to the European Commission less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish government has already committed to pay the costs of requests for the status of settlement of EU citizens working in transferred public services.
Freeman wrote in her letter: “During the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the withdrawal continue and are heading towards the expected decisions this autumn.
However, the UK government is also taking steps to prepare for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must be a very disturbing time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reassure you once again how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services and are beneficial to patients and the communities to which we provide services.
Scotland is absolutely your home and our fervent desire is for you to stay here."
Christion Abercrombie Performs Emergency Surgery After Head Injury
Tennessee defenseman Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 defeat by rival Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
"He came to the sideline and he just collapsed there," Reed said.
Coaches and medics put Abercrombie on the sidelines of oxygen and then put him on stretchers and prepared him for further assessment.
A Tennessee official told Chrisz Harris of the WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details on the type/range of injuries" are yet available and that the state of Tennessee is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, second in the red jersey, completes the first season for the state of Tennessee after being transferred from Illinois.
Before the end of the game on Saturday, he had five total surgeries, which means a total of 18 surgeries in the season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher property tax when they buy a property in the UK, with the extra money being used to help the homeless under Tory’s new plans.
This act will neutralize the success of Corbyn's move to attract young voters.
The increase in the obligation of higher property tax will apply to persons who do not pay taxes in the UK
An increase of <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year in the state treasury is envisaged – to help the homeless
Foreign buyers will pay a higher tax on the purchase of real estate when they buy a property in the UK, with the extra money being used to help homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
This act will be seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn’s campaign to attract young voters with promises to provide more affordable accommodation and a focus on high-income people.
The increase in real estate tax will apply to individuals and companies that do not pay taxes in the UK, with the money also bolstering the government’s efforts to fight sleepless sleep over their heads.
The surcharge, which is in addition to the current obligation to pay property tax, including the higher levels introduced two years ago at other homes and the purchase for rental purposes, can reach up to three percent.
The state treasury is expected to raise funds by up to <0xC2><0xA3>120 million a year.
Estimates say that newly built properties in London are being bought by 13 percent of non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to climb the ladder at home.
A lot of the country’s rich areas – especially in the capital – have become “spirit cities” precisely because of the high number of buyers from abroad who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new rules came just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in property tax to help more young people move to their own first home.
He accused large construction firms of holding real estate prices high by taking up land but not using it, and urged Mrs May to withdraw quotas from affordable homes to fix Britain’s “hostile homes.”
Mr Corbyn announced a string of proposed housing reforms, including rent management and the end of “innocent” emigration.
It also wants to increase the powers of committees to build new homes.
Mrs May said: “Last year I said that I wanted to dedicate my efforts as Prime Minister to restoring the British dream – so that every new generation has a better life.
And that means fixing our damaged real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and shape life here.
However, it cannot be right to make it easy for entities that do not live in the UK and for foreign companies to be able to buy homes as well as hard-working UK residents.
For a lot of people, the dream of owning a home is too far away and the shame of sleeping without a roof over their heads is too real.”
Jack Ross: 'My highest ambition is to run Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his “highest ambition” is to become Scotland’s manager at a certain stage.
The 42-year-old is looking forward to the challenge of rebuilding the Northeast club, which currently holds the third position in the Premier League, just three degrees below the top.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light after St Mirren brought the Scottish Premiership back last season.
“I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B grade and it was," Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
“But I grew up watching Scotland in Hampden with my dad when I was a kid, and that’s always something that pulls me back.
But such an opportunity would only come if I were successful in running the club.”
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland managers were Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Former Alloa Athletic boss says he didn’t feel any anxiety about the succession of such established names in such a big club when he had previously turned down pre-games from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
“Success for me at the time would be about whether I can bring this club back to the Premier League.
Due to the structure and equipment in this club, he undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League," he said.
“It’s not an easy task to bring him back, but I think I would feel successful if I could bring the club back.”
Ross has only been in management for three years, having previously served as an assistant manager at Dumarton and spent 15 months as a Hearts coach.
He then helped Alloa recover from a stint in the third group and transformed St Mirren from a slump to a championship winner the following season.
And Ross says he has a much better feeling now than he has ever had in his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"They were probably real crossroads," he recalls of the time that Alloa got married.
“I really believed that leadership was the right thing for me, more than just playing.
It sounds weird because I was good, making good money from it and enjoying reasonable heights.
But playing can be challenging.
There are a lot of things you have to go through each week.
I still go through them in terms of the stress and pressure of the work, but I just feel good in leadership.
I’ve always wanted to be a manager and now I’m doing it, I feel like I’m feeling the most in my skin now in my entire adult life.”

Research has found that a great time to pint is on Saturday at 5:30 p.m.
The summer heat wave has increased the incomes of British pubs facing difficulties, but has increased the pressure on the restaurant chain.
The figures show that groups of pubs and bars recorded a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July – but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin of the consulting firm CGA, which produced the final report, said: “The stable sunshine and longer-than-expected participation of England in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern to the previous June, when attendance at the pub increased by 2.8 percent, but the restaurants were even higher.
The decline in restaurant sales by 1.8 percent in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars that attract drinks have behaved the most in the same way as the restaurants have deteriorated.
Hosts whose main revenue is from food have also suffered from the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
Looks like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Between controlled values and bars, beverage sales rose 6.6 percent for the month, while food sales fell three percent.
Paul Newman of Leisure and Hospitality Analytics said: “These results are a continuation of the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales outside the domestic market.
It’s no surprise that restaurant chains continue to struggle, even though the 4.8 percent annual decline in sales will be particularly painful in light of ongoing cost pressures.
A long hot summer cannot be a worse time for food-inducing business operators, and time will tell whether the milder temperatures we experienced in August will bring so much-needed relief.”
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly opened ones, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand presentation.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry sales monitor for the UK’s pubs, bars and restaurants sector collects and analyzes performance data from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over <0xC2><0xA3>9 billion, which is an established industry benchmark in the industry.

One in five children – at the age of just 11 – create social media accounts that they hide from their parents.
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rapid increase in “fake Instagram accounts” on which they share photos.
Reports indicate that there are concerns that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of students said they have a beautified “main” account that their parents know about, while also having a private account.
A mother who came across her 13-year-old daughter’s secret website found that her teenage daughter was encouraging others to “rape her.”
Research conducted by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) association of independent schools has shown that 40 percent of 11- to 18-year-old students have two profiles, with half admitting to having private accounts.
HMC boss Mike Buchanan said: “It’s worrying that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where their parents and educators can’t find them.”
Eilidh Doyle will be the "voice of athletes" on Scotland's athletics committee
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Committee as non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the Steering Committee.
Doyle is the most prized lightweight athlete, and Chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those in sports leadership like those who will benefit from her extensive international experience over the past decade.
"Eilidh has a great deal of respect in the Scottish, British and global athletic community and we are confident that it will be very beneficial for athletics in Scotland if she is a member of the committee," Beattie said.
Doyle said: “I’m excited to be the voice of the athletes and I hope to be really helpful and help lead the sport in Scotland.”
The American, who won 200 and 400 metres at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, won a total of four gold medals and is now a regular BBC expert, could not walk after a transient ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: “I lost an attack a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time will tell if I will recover or to what extent.
It's exhausting, but I've been able to fully heal, I've learned to walk again, and I'm doing the exercise today!
Thank you for all the encouraging news!"
Milk sucker eliciting comparison of mothers to cows shares opinions online
The company involved in the production of vacuum cleaners has divided online opinion by advertising, which compares nursing mothers to nursing cows.
As part of the launch of “the world’s first silent portable vacuum cleaner”, consumer technology company Envi has released an over-the-top music video showing the freedom the new vacuum cleaner gives nursing mothers.
Four real mothers dance in a barn full of hay with cows to a song with the text: "Yes, I'm impressed, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you didn't notice that I don't have feathers, here are my breasts."
The choir continues: “Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump, feed my sweet milk.”
However, the ad, which was posted on the company’s Facebook page, sparked online controversy.
The video had 77,000 views and hundreds of comments and received mixed reactions from those who saw it, with many saying it sheds light on the “horror” of the dairy industry.
“It is a very poor decision to abuse cows for advertising this product.
Just like us, they have to be pregnant and give birth to be able to give milk, but their babies are taken away a few days after giving birth,” says one of the comments.
Vacuum Cleaner Elvie discreetly attaches to nursing breast (Elvie/mother)
Another comment: “Obviously traumatic for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise on the breast pump for mothers who keep their children?"
Someone else added, “This ad is completely off.”
There were also those who defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she considered the song "infective".
“I think it’s a brilliant idea.
I'd get that pump if I was still breastfeeding.
I feel exactly like a cow when vacuuming.
Advertising is a little crazy, but it's about the thing.
It's a brilliant product," one user wrote.
She added: “It’s a fun ad for mothers who suck their milk (often at work or on the toilet) and feel like ‘cows’.
It’s not an advertisement to praise or denigrate the dairy industry.”
At the end of the video, a group of women show that they are all dancing with discreet suction cups hidden under the bra.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the observation that a lot of women who suck their milk say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie vacuum cleaner is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and hides beautifully in a nursing bra, giving women freedom of movement, the ability to hold a baby and even walk when vacuuming.
Ana Balarin, a partner and ECD for mothers, added: “The Elvie is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a significant and provocative launch.
By creating a parallel between nursing mothers and nursing cows, we wanted to point out the suction of milk and all the challenges associated with it, while showing a fun and reliable incredible sense of freedom that the new vacuum cleaner will provide.
This isn't the first time Elvie's vacuum has gone out.
During London Fashion Week, one of the two mothers, designer Marta Jakubowski, who was using the product, appeared on the pier.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children detained has risen sharply despite the fact that monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, especially as the harsh rhetoric and principles introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to place children with escorts.
Most of the escorts were traditionally made up of undocumented immigrants who were afraid of the threat of staying in the country, so they claimed to belong to the child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households must provide fingerprints and that this data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Department testified over Congress that the agency had arrested hundreds of people who were applying for unaccompanied minor escort status.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested did not have prior criminal records.
As many as 80 percent of the people who are sponsors or members of the sponsor’s household are illegal in our country, and a large number of them are criminals.
So we continue to pursue them," Mr. Albence said.
According to asylum workers, in an effort to speed up the processing of children's affairs, officials have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within a month of detention, instead of the previous standard 60 days.
A lot of people appear through video conference calls instead of in person to declare their case legal status for an immigrant judge.
Those who are not eligible for assistance will be quickly deported.
The longer a child is in foster care, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to outbursts of anger or attempts to escape, asylum officials say, and report from the system over the past few months.
Lawyers say these concerns are heightened in a larger facility, such as Tornillo, where signs of the child’s suffering are more likely to go unnoticed, precisely because of the size of the facility.
They added that moving children to a tent camp without enough time devoted to emotional preparation or parting with friends could trigger the trauma that many children are already struggling with.
Syria says U.S., French and Turkish "occupational elements" must be withdrawn immediately
During a speech at the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees to their homes, even though the country is already in its eighth year of war.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces in Syria are illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "it will be dealt with accordingly."
"He must give up immediately and unconditionally," he said at the meeting.
Moualem insisted that "the war on terrorism in Syria is almost over", with more than 360,000 people killed and millions more missing their homes since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue to fight "in this holy battle until we get rid of all Syrian territories" of terrorist groups and "any illegal aliens present."
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and advising Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
In issuing the refugees, Moual said the conditions for their return were good and accused “some Western countries” of “spreading irrational fears” that caused the refugees not to want to return.
“We have called on international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate these returns,” he said.
“They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian matter.”
The United States and the European Union have warned that no recovery aid will be available for Syria until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
U.N. diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone at the last Idlib refugee camp has created an opportunity to move on in political discussions.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-protected Syrian forces in the province where three million people live.
Moualem, however, pointed out that the deal has "clearly given deadlines" and expressed hope that the military intervention would target jihadists, including fighters from the Nusra Front with al-Qaeda ties, who "will be wiped out."
United Nations envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee consisting of members of the government and opposition will soon be held to propose a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set out the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited to "checking the articles of the existing constitution" and issued a warning before stepping in.
Why Trump will win in the second period
According to this logic, Donald Trump would win the next election in 2020 if, as many liberal observers hope, the indictment and scandals prematurely ended his office as president.
In that case, it would undoubtedly be “the most dramatic presidential term finale in history!”
So far, there have been no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, mainstream viewing has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average viewing of 2.4 million in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and The Rachel Maddow Show on MSNBC has increased cable TV viewing to 3.5 million watching prime night news.
"It's a heat that attracts people because it's something we don't understand," Neal Baer, the operator of the "Designated Survivor" show on ABC's drama about the cabinet secretary who became president after the attack destroyed the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, an experienced comedian and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
He remembers driving a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
“He said, ‘Because he’s funny,’” Mrs. Scovell told me.
It's the meaning of fun in chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story taking place in of Washington could predetermine the future of Roe v. Wada, whether immigrant families can reunite and benefit the global economy.
Decorating is a luxury that only the most privileged watchers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond whether you’re an informed citizen when you’re watching a six-hour panel of experts discussing how Bob Woodward uses “deep back-up” resources for his book “Fear,” petrifying Paul Manafort’s $15,000 leather jackets (“and Daniel’s clothes of arrogance” as the Post puts it).
I’m not going to look at Super Maria the same way again.
“Part of what it does and what makes the reality show feel like is that it feeds you something every night,” said Brent Montgomery, head of Wheelhouse Entertainment and author of the Pawn Stars documentary about the rotating N.F.L. Trump show in which he appreciates Kim Jong-un.

When I got in touch with Mr. Fleisse this week, it was a sunny 80 degrees outside on the northern shore of Kauai, but he was stuck inside watching MSNBC and recording for CNN.
He couldn't break away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood up to the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court was in jeopardy.
“I remember when we were doing all those crazy shows and people were saying, ‘This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,’” Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I think it was supposed to be a joke, but it turned out they were right."

Money from outside is flowing into the tightest domestic mid-term elections
It’s no surprise that Pennsylvania’s 17th arrondissement is experiencing an influx of funding thanks to the reorganization of congressional districts that generated two office holders fighting for the same seat.
This recently led to the transformation of the suburban district of Pittsburg by district Democratic Republican Conor Lamb – who won another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb stands against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which heavily overlaps with the new 17.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally divided in favor of the Republicans, the maps were redrawn.
The race in the new 17th arrondissement launched a fierce financial dispute between the main party's financial branches, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
The name Lamb became known in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the watched March special election in the 18th congressional district.
This seat was occupied by a Republican for more than a decade and Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts give the Democrats a slight head start.
U.S. Seeks to Punish Salvador for Support of China, Resigns
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing under moderate pressure from Washington.
President Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and was staying at a hotel in Panama until the partners judicially relocated the Trump administration’s organizing team.
State Department officials have decided to recall U.S. diplomatic mission directors from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama on the basis of "recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan," State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement issued earlier this month.
But the fines were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including funds for drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which included cuts to financial aid and focused on visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
With ongoing internal negotiations, North and Central American leaders have postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity following similar negotiations from the previous year, which was seen as a step forward in efforts to prevent migrants heading to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials had made it clear that they wanted to continue negotiations and effectively end any fines being considered for Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now tasked with resolving the conference currently scheduled for mid-October, as part of a signal the administration is putting on hold, diplomats said.
And the three U.S. envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new unbreakable news from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal negotiations on conditions of anonymity.
Their sources have been confirmed by an external analyst who is close to the government executive and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
History of studies
The final nail in the coffin could be Robert Mueller’s report from the Special Commission on the possible obstruction of Mr. Trump’s exercise of law, which is now well documented in public records.
In his investigation, Mr. Mueller reportedly also addresses whether Mr. Trump’s campaign did not contain a secret agreement with Russia regarding the attack on our election.
If there were to be an exchange of parties in Congress, Mr. Trump would have to take responsibility before this body, just as he is preparing to appear before the voters again, and eventually he would probably be expected by a jury made up of his colleagues.
That’s a whole series of “ifs,” and I don’t want to argue that Mr. Trump’s downfall is inevitable — as is the case with similar politicians in Europe.
Each of us on both sides of the Atlantic has a choice before us that will affect how long the suffering will last.
In 1938, German officers were ready to stage a coup against Hitler, just enough for the Western powers to stand up and support him in Munich, Czechoslovakia.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid the long years of bloodshed that followed.
History revolves around such critical moments that accelerate or slow down the relentless course of democracy.
Americans are now facing a number of similar critical moments.
What do we do if Mr. Trump throws out Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who leads the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein had been bent on this since the report announced that he had proposed secretly recording the president last year, speculating that he was not in a state of health to be able to hold the presidency.
According to Mr. Rosenstein, The Times' versions are inaccurate.
“How do we respond if the newly requested F.B.I. Brett Kavanaugh investigation is not complete or fair – or what if it is upheld in the Supreme Court despite a compelling allegation of sexual assault and a wrongful confession?
And most importantly, will we be voting in mid-term Congress to ascribe responsibility to Mr. Trump?
If we fail in these tests, democracy will have a long dark night ahead.
But I believe that we are not wrong, thanks to the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my ambassadorial home.
She survived, she emigrated to America and 60 years later she sent me to light candles on the table with a swastika on Saturday.
How could I not be optimistic about our future with such a legacy?”

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers is optimistic about the clash with Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday with the knowledge that a victory over the Austrians would give them great hope for progress from the European League Group G after an impressive draw in Spain at Villarreal earlier this month.
The knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from appearing on the pitch for the first time in the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use the result as a stepping stone to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us because Villarreal has a quality team," the 31-year-old said.
“We went into the game with the belief that we could break something, and we took the point.
Maybe we could have multiplied it in the end, but overall the draw was probably fair.
They were probably better in the first half, but in the second half we improved and we were better again.
It will be another big European night on Thursday.
I hope that we can get three points, but it will be difficult, because in the last game they played a good result. However, with the spectators behind me, I am sure that we can push and it will go well.
Last year was tough enough, with all my injuries and changes at the club, but now I feel really good about it.
The team is strong and the guys really enjoy it, the training is also good.
I hope that we can build on that now, throw the past season behind us and be successful.”
Women Are Worried About Retirement Savings
Although the survey participants had a clear idea of how to take care of them, few people talked about it with family members.
About half of the people in the nationwide study said they discussed the price of long-term care with their partner.
Only 10 percent said they talked about it with their children.
“People want a family member to take care of them, but they don’t decide to discuss it with them,” explains Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Company.
You can start like this.
Talk to your partner and children: You can’t prepare your family to provide care unless you reveal your wishes to them in advance.
Together with your counselor and family, discuss where and how to receive care, as these factors can play a big role in determining price.
Invite your financial advisor: A financial advisor can help you find a way to pay for these expenses.
Long-term care can be financed, for example, by traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid cash life insurance to help you pay for these expenses, or by using your own insurance with your own funds – as long as you have the money.
Create your own legal documents: Prevent legal battles as long as you can.
Choose a health care representative, who will be a trusted person who will oversee your medical care and ensure that doctors follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate on your own.
Also consider writing full power for your finances.
You will choose a trusted person who will make financial decisions for you and will ensure the payment of your accounts in the event that you are not eligible for it yourself.
Don’t forget the little details: Imagine that your old parent needs a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about his medications and allergies?
Write down these details in a written plan to be prepared.
“It’s not just the finances at stake, but what are the names of the treating doctors?” asks Martin.
“Where are the medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Have that plan ready at hand.”
A man in Ilfracombe has been shot from an airship several times.
When the man returned home on foot after a night shift, he was hit by several shots from the air conditioner.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when she was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which took place around 02:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim did not see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said the death toll is expected to rise further.
Since communication is out of service, auxiliary units could not obtain any information from the Donggal regency, which is an area north of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the earthquake by a force of 7.5 degrees.
After the disaster, more than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu.
Here are some key facts about the city of Palu and the regency of Donggala, on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of the island of Sulawesi and its population was estimated at 379,800 in 2017.
The city was just celebrating its 40th anniversary when an earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is a regency stretching along more than 300 km (180 mi) along the coast in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The regency, an administrative region under the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main components of the economy of the province of Central Sulawesi are fishing and farming, especially in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also significant in the province, but it is concentrated mainly in Morowala on the opposite coast of the island of Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggal have been hit by the tsunami several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggale killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
The tsunami struck west of Donggala in 1996, when it claimed nine victims.
Indonesia is located on the seismic Pacific Ring of Fire, and earthquakes occur regularly there.
Here is a list of some of the biggest earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 caused a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh province.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, near the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the south of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, causing a tsunami that hit the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands near Sumatra, causing a 10-metre-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and claimed the lives of around 300 people.
2016: A light earthquake struck the regency of Pidie Jaya in Aceh province, causing destruction and panic as it reminded people of the devastating effects of the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunamis were formed, but more than 100 died due to falling buildings.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake has destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily imprisoned.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on domestic violence charges
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of assault.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, a 29-year-old Palin living in Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, violation of domestic violence reports, and obstruction of arrest.
When, according to a police report, his female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, Palin picked up her phone.
Palin has been sent to the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and is being held on an unsecured $500 bond, KTUU reports.
According to the network's report, he appeared in court on Saturday, where he said he felt "definitely innocent" when asked to comment.
Palin faces three Class A offenses, meaning he could be sentenced to up to a year in prison and up to $250,000 in fines.
At the same time, he was charged with a Class B felony, which is punishable by a one-day prison sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has faced criminal charges.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
The alleged attack on the police was reported by his mother, Sarah Palin, by telephone.
The case is currently before the Alaskan War Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, violation of domestic violence reports and possession of weapons under the influence of narcotic drugs in connection with the incident.
He allegedly punched his girlfriend in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized in 2016 by groups of war veterans when she associated her son’s violent behavior with a post-traumatic stress disorder caused by her son’s service in Iraq.
Indonesian Earthquake and Tsunami: Hundreds of Dead
At least 384 people have died after an earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are out of service and the number of victims is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck the island of Sulawesi, which is northeast of Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
On social media, videos have appeared depicting the moment of the disaster.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami struck the coast.
Federal prosecutors demand an exceptional death penalty for a suspect in a terrorist attack in NYC
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfull Saipov, who is suspected of committing a terrorist attack in New York that killed eight people — an exceptional sentence that has not been awarded for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly carried out an attack on a bike path along West Side Highway in the Lower Manhattan neighborhood in October using a rented Home Depot truck to tow pedestrians and cyclists.
In order to defend the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" caused a number of injuries - thus defining the terms of the intention to award the death penalty according to a document approved by the Southern District of New York court.
According to court documents, both numbers would mean the possibility of a death penalty.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury charged Saipov with 22 crimes, including charges of murder in favor of extortion commonly used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime, and charges of violence and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required “significant planning and preparation,” the plaintiffs say, describing the way Saipov’s act was done as hideous, cruel, and perverse.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevi<0xC4><0x87> Saipov has caused injury, pain and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Ferruchi, Hern<0xC3><0xA1>n Diego Mendoza and Alejandro S<0xC3><0xA1>m<0xC3><0xA1>l<0xC3><0xA1>n," said in a statement.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It has been 10 years since the Southern District of New York passed the death penalty.
The defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug suppliers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was actually carried out was in connection with a federal case in New York in 1953, when the married couple Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed, which proved a conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs sat in an electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, expressed minimal regret over the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
According to police, he said he felt good about what he had done.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired by watching Islamic State videos over the phone to carry out the attack.
The police also announced that they also demanded the hanging of the flag of the Islamic State in the hospital room.
He said he felt innocent about 22 of the charges.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said they were "obviously disappointed" by the plaintiffs' decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty instead of accepting a life sentence without the possibility of release will only prolong the trauma of these events for everyone concerned," Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had previously asked the plaintiffs not to demand the death penalty.
Conservative MPs say he should be in charge of Brexit negotiations NIGEL FARAGE
Nigel Farage pledged to “mobilize the army of the people” during today’s protest at the Conservative Party conference.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party has said politicians must “feel pressure” from Eurosceptics – as one of Theresa May’s own MPs suggested, he should negotiate with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone said at a march in Birmingham that the UK “would be out by now” if Mr Farage were Brexit secretary.
But the problem that Mrs May faces as she reconciles her ranks, where there is a deep divide, has been highlighted by conservatives fighting to stay in the EU, who have joined a separate protest against Brexit in the city.
The prime minister is trying to keep her compromise plan from the Chequers going under attacks from Brexit supporters, supporters of staying in the Union and the EU itself.
The allies insist that they will continue to try to reach an agreement with Brussels regardless of the consequences – and will force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between its package and “chaos”.
Mr Bone said the Leave Means Leave group would gather in Solihull, where he wanted to “cash out on Chequers.”
He suggested to Mr Farage that he should become a representative and be responsible for negotiating with Brussels.
“If he were in charge, we would be out today,” he said.
Wellingborough added: “I will stand for Brexit, but we have to give up on Chequers.”
To show his opposition to the EU, he said: “We didn’t fight the world wars so we had to listen.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.”
Mr Bone rejected suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote: “The idea that British citizens would change their minds and want to stay is utterly perverse.”
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns, who also took part in the march, told reporters: “I simply say: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
“Chequers are unpopular with the general public, the opposition won’t vote for them and they don’t like our party members or our activists who are currently filling the streets to get us elected at all.
Forget about Chequers and start listening.’
In a sharp report to Mrs May, she says: “The Prime Ministers will hold their seats if they keep their promises.”
Mr Farage said conservative politicians must “get into an unpleasant situation” if they want to betray their decision taken on the basis of the 2016 referendum.
“Now it’s about trust between us – the people – and our political class,” he said.
“They’re trying to betray Brexit, and we’re standing here today to tell them we’re not going to let you do that.”
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: “I want our political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, to feel the pressure.
“We are now mobilising the army of the people of this country who have secured our victory in the Brexit referendum, and we will not rest until we become an independent and proud Britain that rules itself.”
Proponents of staying in the Union meanwhile marched through Birmingham and then held a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
Several activists waved banners at the Conservatives against Brexit after the party’s weekend start.
Labour MP Lord Adonis made fun of the Conservatives over security concerns about the party's application after the start of the conference.
“These are people who, in their own words, can provide IT systems and technology for Canada plus plus, for smooth borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland,” he added.
"It's all bullshit.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit,” he added.
Warren plans to “consider” her candidacy for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said in a statement that she would "consider" her candidacy for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about her future on Saturday at a town hall in western Massachusetts.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is seeking a November re-election against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who co-chaired the 2016 Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
The Saturday afternoon event in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the town hall since Trump took office.
One of the participants asked her if she planned to apply for the office of president.
Warren replied that the time had come “for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government, and that means a woman in the highest place.”
He was arrested on suspicion of shooting Sims from LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that they had detained a suspect in Friday’s shooting of LSU basketball player Wayda Sims.
The Baton Rouge police department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson, at 11:00 ET news conference.
A video was released of Friday's shooting with a request to identify the man captured on the tape.
Sims, 20, was shot dead Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a fatal gunshot wound to the head that didn't match his life," Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told media via 247sports on Saturday.
Wayde tried to protect his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted that he was moving at the scene, had a gun, and confessed to the shooting of Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot, 6-inch-high Sims, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played 32 games, 10 of which were last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton approaches the title of world champion when the team director takes his victory over Sebastian Vettel into his hands
As soon as Valtteri Bottas finished in Saturday's qualifier ahead of Lewis Hamilton, it was clear that Mercedes' team management would play a major role in the race.
Bottas had a good start from the field and almost got rid of Hamilton when he defended his position in the first two corners and urged Vettel to attack a team-mate.
Vettel entered the depot first and let Hamilton catch the cars circling on the group's tail, which should be decisive.
The rider of the Mercedes drove into the pit about a lap later and after the exit he joined Vettel. However, Hamilton went ahead and in a close fight the Ferrari rider had to reluctantly leave the inner track free so that he could defend in the third corner after the double maneuver.
Max Verstappen took off from the back row of the field and was in charge at the end of the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He then led much of the race because he held on to the original tyres for as long as possible to focus on the quick finish and be able to take Kimi Raikkonen's fourth position.
In the end, he went to the Depot in the 44th round, but in the remaining eight rounds he could not increase the pace and Raikkonen remained fourth.
It's a tough day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend, and when he got the order, he behaved like a perfect gentleman.
The team has done a fantastic job and the prize is the first two places," Hamilton said.
It was a really bad body language
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at Saturday's meeting for insisting she didn't publish a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During his speech at the West Virginia assembly, he did not directly mention Ford’s testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead stating that what is happening in the Senate shows that people are “evil and disgusting and lying.”
“One thing that could happen, and one wonderful thing that happens in the last few days in the Senate, when you see that anger, when you see those people being angry and angry and disgusting and lying,” he said.
“When you look at the release and the release and they say, ‘Oh, I didn’t do it.
I didn't do it."
You remember?
Dianne Feinstein, can you help me escape?
Remember her answer... you published the document – ‘ah, ah, what?
Oh, no.
She didn't publish."
Well, wait a minute.
We published... No, not that," he added, imitating the senator.
The Feinsteins sent Ford a letter detailing the charges against Kavanaugh in July, and the information leaked in early September — but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from her office.
"I did not cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, nor did I disclose the information about the case," Feinstein said, according to The Hill.
"She asked me to keep everything secret and I did exactly what she asked me to do."
However, in her words, apparently, the president did not believe the case, who said at the meeting on Saturday evening: “I will tell you that this is a really bad body language.
She may not have done it, but it’s the worst body language I’ve ever seen.”
The president went on to defend a candidate for the Supreme Court judge, whom three women have accused of sexual harassment, and suggested the Democrats are using these accusations for their own ends.
“They are determined to take back power by whatever means are available.
You see the meanness, the ugliness, they don't care who gets hurt, who has to get into the country to get back to power and to the helm," Mediaite said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars corrected Friday's loss in the Elite League against the Belfast Giants by winning Saturday's match in Dundee, which ended 5-3.
The Giants soon took a two-door lead thanks to the interventions of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie managed to make up for the home run before Dwyer returned the Giants' lead.
Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bouchard then scored for Dundee again, whereupon two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured their victory.
It was the third loss in the Elite League this season for Adam Keefe, who managed to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
The two teams met for the fourth time in the season, with all three previous games being dominated by the Giants.
Dwyer's first goal came in the fourth minute, at 3:35, for Kendall McFaul's assist, while David Rutherford conceded his assist to Beauvillier's second goal four minutes later.
The first third was wild when Sullivan got his home back in the game at 13:10 and then Matt Marquardt prepared a goal for Cownie, who was comparing at 15:16.
Thanks to Dwyer, the Giants went into the cockpit for the first break only in the lead when he scored his second goal in the evening at the end of the first third.
The home team regrouped and Bouchard again managed to make up for the overtime goal at 27:37.
The joint effort of Cownie and Charles Corcoran later helped Nielsen for the first time in the match to side Dundee and the same player secured the lead of his team in the middle of the final third.
The Giants, who have now lost the fourth of their last five games, will play another game on Friday at home at Milton Keynes.
The head of air traffic died to allow hundreds of people on board the plane to escape the earthquake.
Indonesia’s flight chief is hailed as a hero after he died as he watched as a plane with hundreds of people on board safely took off.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, causing a tsunami.
Severe subsequent tremors flooded the area and many people remained trapped in the ruins of the city of Palu.
But despite the fact that colleagues of twenty-one-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung ran away to save their lives, he refused to leave his place in the wildly shimmering steering tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He remained in his position to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, was able to take off safely.
Then he jumped down from the control tower, thinking he was slipping.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait told Australia's ABC News that the decision had helped save hundreds of lives.
We prepared transport by helicopter from Balikpapan to Kalimantan, which was transferred to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"Our hearts are broken by this message," he added.
Meanwhile, authorities have expressed concern that the death toll could reach thousands. The agency responsible for disaster management said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
“The death toll continues to rise as many bodies remain unscathed under the rubble and many still have not been rescued,” said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves in the devastated Palu reached a height of up to six meters. Mass funerals will be held in the city on Sunday.
Both military and civilian aircraft bring aid and supplies to the affected areas.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: “Every minute the ambulance brings in more bodies.
There is a shortage of drinking water.
“Small businesses are being stolen everywhere.”
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: “The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors, but we don’t know what they will find on the spot.
It’s a tragedy, but it could be worse.”
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country’s military units: “I ask you to work day and night to complete all the tasks needed to evacuate.
"Are you ready?" said CNN.
Indonesia was hit this year by an earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini now claims one person is missing after plane crash in lagoon
The airline, which crashed in a lagoon on one of the micronesian islands in the Pacific, now said one person was missing, initially stating that all passengers and crew of a total of 47 people had safely evacuated from the plunging aircraft.
Air Niugini said in a press release that it was unable to find one man on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the missing man.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests to provide details of this passenger, his age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the airport on the island of Chuuk.
Officials said on Friday a total of seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in the hospital on Saturday and were all in a stable condition.
However, what caused the crash and the exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon just before the runway.
Some of the witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said the plane was landing from a very low altitude.
"That was very good," Jaynes said.
Jaynes went on to say that he and the others managed to get water down the deep lane to the emergency exits of the plunging plane.
He also said that the crew members panicked and screamed, and that he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy said sailors who worked nearby to repair the docks helped rescue them with an inflatable boat that carried passengers to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
According to Aviation Safety Network data, a total of 111 people have died in PNG-branded aircraft accidents over the past two decades, but no accidents have occurred to Air Niuguni.
The analyst describes the last moments of a woman who was burned alive
The indictment on Saturday ended its speech in this case, in which the man is repeatedly tried for burning a woman alive in the state of Mississippi in 2014.
The U.S. Department of Justice, in the person of its analyst Paul Rowlett, testified for several hours and provided expert advice in the field of intelligence analysis.
An analyst for the jury designed a scenario of how he used the records from the cell phone of 29 defendant Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers from the night she died.
Rowlett said he obtained location data from several mobile phones that showed Tellis was at Chambers' company on the night of her death, which contradicted his previous statement, The Clarion Ledger newspaper said.
When it was revealed from his cell phone that he had spent the night with Chambers, he said he had been with his friend Michael Sanford, who was then visited by the police.
Sanford stood before a council court and testified that the day in question was not in the city.
When the plaintiffs asked if Tellis was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "lying because my car was in Nashville that night."
Another disagreement was that Tellis stated that he knew Chambers for about two weeks on the day she died.
However, records from the mobile phone indicate that the two had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He cut her out of his life entirely," Hale said.
The defense will begin its final speech on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be heard before the jury later that day.
High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip-hop trio wants to deal with negative opinions about this genre by filling their music with positive messages.
The Bristol-based band High Breed claims that hip hop has moved from its beginnings with political messages and solutions to social problems.
So they want to go back to their roots and re-popularize conscious hip hop.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have met with revival in the recent past thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey in the UK.
Another black woman?!
NEW YORK (AP) — A New York-based educator is suing a couple over her dismissal of a “racist” text message.
A New York-based schoolgirl is suing a couple for her discriminatory eviction after she received an erroneous text message from her mother, in which she was labeled a “further black” text message.
The couple denied they were racists and compared the lawsuit to “extortion.”
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, the mother of two, expressed dismay when she found out on her first day at work in 2016 that her children’s new educator, Giselle Maurice, was black.
"NEED, OTHER BLACK," Fr. Plasco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text message.
However, instead of sending her to her husband, she was sent twice by Father Maurice.
When she understood her faux pas, the “concerned” Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman threw out Mrs. Maurice and said that her outgoing educator, who was African-American, was actually working badly and that she was expecting a Filipina instead, the New York Post reported.
Mrs. Maurice got paid for one job and was sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing a couple for compensation for being fired and seeking compensation of $350 for a day of six-month engagement for which she was initially hired, albeit without a contract.
“I want to show them that this is not happening,” she told the Post on Friday, adding: “I know it’s discrimination.”
However, the couple returned the blow with the fact that they were not racists, but that the termination of Ms. Maurice's employment was an appropriate measure, because they feared that they could no longer trust her after that insult.
“My wife sent her something she didn’t want to say.
She's definitely not a racist.
We are not racists,” her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
“But would you entrust your child to the hands of someone you treated rudely, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Oh, come on.
Plasco likened the lawsuit to “extortion” and said his wife was only caring for a two-month-old child and was in “a very difficult situation.”
“Would you drive someone like that?
That’s not a good thing at all,” the investment banker said.
Although the lawsuit is still pending, the jury on social media very quickly convicted the couple for their behavior and logic.
Publishers of the Paddington Bear stories feared that readers would not identify with the talking bear, according to the latest reports.
Bond’s daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book’s adoption, told the reporter: “It’s hard to feel like someone who’s reading it for the first time before it’s published.
But it’s very fun to know now that we already know Paddington’s tremendous success.”
She said her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write a children's book about a small plush bear, was very disappointed that his work was rejected, adding on the day of the 60th anniversary of the book's publication, which became a "sweetheart" to him.
To Paddington, whom she describes as “a very important member of her family,” she added that her father was very proud of his ultimate success.
"He was quite a quiet man, he was never in any way boastful," she said.
“But because Paddington was such a real character to him, it was like having a child who achieved something you can be really proud of.
I think he looked at Paddington's success with that look.
Even though it was his mere creation and imagination, he always tried to attribute all his successes only to Paddington.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louise Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to save her life.
"Nad called me regularly to tell me that it was really bad and that he didn't expect her to get out of it," Ms Ednan-Laperouse said.
“Then I got a call from Nad, where she told me she was going to die in the next two minutes and I had to say goodbye.
That's how I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you dearly.
I'll be there with you soon.
I'll be there with you.
Medications given to her by doctors to keep her heart running slowly lost their effectiveness and left her body.
She died shortly after, and it was as if everything had closed down.
I just had to sit there and wait, I knew what was going on.
I couldn’t cry or scream because I was surrounded by families and other people.
I just had to keep it inside me.”
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, without revealing what a difficult test she was going through.
"Nobody knew about it," she said.
“I kept my head down, tears were running down my face all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was just during the flight that I felt an amazing understanding of Nada.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.”
Grieving women send postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones as a result of suicide work together to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send out postcards of the Welsh Bridge with inspirational messages and phone numbers on which people can look for support.
Mrs. Davis’ son Tyler was only 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and, as a result, took his own life at the age of 18.
“I don’t want any other parent to have to feel what I feel every day,” she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a gifted young chef with a contagious smile.
"Everyone knew him because of his smile.
They always said that his smile could light up any room."
However, he left work before his death because he was “in a really dark place.”
In 2014, Tyler’s 11-year-old brother found his sibling’s immobile body after he took his own life.
Mrs. Davis says, "I'm always worried about how it's going to affect his life."
Ms Davis suggested a postcard “to inform people that they have people at their disposal who are willing to help them and can talk to them even if they are their friends.
Don’t sit still – you have to talk.”
Mrs. Humphreys, who is Mrs. Davies’s best friend, lost Mark, who had been her partner for 15 years, shortly after his mother’s death.
"Nothing told me he was feeling down or depressed, nothing at all," he explains.
“A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
The worst part was on Christmas Day — when the kids opened the presents, didn’t even look at them, nothing.”
She said that the death of her partner was a huge trauma for them, but that she must gradually get over it: “Such a thing can make a complete hole in the family.
It's torn us apart.
But we all have to go on and fight.”

Brett Kavanaugh's future depends on balance as FBI begins its investigation
"I thought we could get something that he actually asked for - a time-limited investigation, with a limited scope - we could bring in a bit of unity," Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would "fall apart" because both sides were scuttled for the party.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican backers want the FBI to start an investigation?
Their resistance is well-timed.
Midterm elections are only five weeks away from us, November 6, and if Republicans are expected to go wrong, it will lead to a fundamental weakening of their efforts to push the man they want into office at the country’s highest court.
George W. Bush phoned the senators, lobbying them in support of Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for President Bush and through him met his wife Ashley, who was Bush’s personal secretary at the time.
What happens if the FBI compiles its report?
The Senate will vote on it, and there are currently 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
Still, it's unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh can receive at least 50 votes in the Senate, allowing Vice President Mike Pence to break the draw and confirm it at the Supreme Court.
The number of refugees from North Korea to Kim has "decreased"
The number of refugees from North Korea to South Korea since the beginning of Kim Jong-un's rule fell seven years ago, South Korean lawmakers say.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from South Korea’s Ministry of Unification, said there had been 1,127 escapes in the past year – up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park also said it was behind stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher rates required by smugglers at the borders.
Pyongyang has not issued a public statement on the matter.
The vast majority of refugees from the North are now being offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul claims that since the end of the Korean War in 1953, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border.
Most of them run across China, with which North Korea has the longest border and is easier to cross than in the heavily protected demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China views refugees as illegal migrants, not refugees, and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between North and South – which are technically still at war – have improved markedly in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks aimed at halting denuclearization talks.
This was followed by a historic June meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed on broad terms of cooperation in the nuclear disarmament of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Jong-ho accused the United States of making no progress on sanctions.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way we can unilaterally disarm," Ri told the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court
Democratic minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh “hysterical” and said he was unfit to serve in the Supreme Court due to his temperament.
Pelosi made the remark in a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune festival in Austin, Texas.
“I couldn’t help but think that if any woman had ever performed such a show, she would have been called ‘hysterical,’” Pelosi said in her response to Kavanaugh’s Thursday statement before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied all allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford at a time when they were both still in puberty.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and suffocating while discussing his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned Democrats on the committee, saying their accusations against him were a "grotesque and coordinated attack" on organized liberals who failed to get over Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said Kavanaugh's resignation proved he was unable to work at the Supreme Court because he showed he was biased against the Democrats.
“I think he disqualified himself with these statements and the way he leaned against the Clintons and the Democrats,” she said.
Pelosi responded negatively to the question of whether she would seek Kavanaugh’s appeal in the event of his confirmation, even if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I will tell you this - if he does not tell Congress the truth, then he is not eligible not only to work in the Supreme Court, but also in the court he is working in now," Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge at the D.C. District Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential court returns under the Affordable Care Act or Roe vs. Wade because he is considered a conservative judge.
In a hearing prior to his confirmation in office, Kavanaugh avoided answering the question of whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court’s rulings.
"There's no time for a hysterical, presumptuous person to go to court and expect us to just say, 'Oh, that's wonderful,'" Pelosi said.
And women have to control it.
After verbal outbursts, months and years of regret, she could not get rid of it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry," Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think that's unusual, do I?"
She continues: “I was helped a lot by a woman who was a director somewhere and who told me that she also cries when she’s angry, but she created a certain technique. This means that when she was angry and started crying, she said to the person she was talking to: “Maybe you think I’m crying because I’m sad.
But I'm angry."
And so she went on.
And I think that’s great.”
Tears are acceptable as a means of responding to anger, partly because they are misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories comes from my first job, where I worked in an office dominated by men. I once expressed my inexpressible anger there by crying. But an older, always cold manager, who I was always a little afraid of, grabbed me by the neck and dragged me in.
"Never show them you're crying," she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be glad they got you."
Patricia Schroeder, a former Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, collaborated with Gary Hart on his presidential candidacy.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught in a bachelorette party aboard the Monkey Business and had to withdraw from the fight, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, found that there was no reason why she could not explore the idea of her own presidential candidacy.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision," she told me with a laugh after 30 years.
“There were already seven candidates running, and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snowflake and the Seven Dwarfs."
Since the campaign had been running for a long time, she was unable to keep up with the receipts, so she made a commitment not to enter the game unless she received $2 million in donations.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some supporters who would give $1,000 to a male candidate would only give her $250.
"Do you think I'll get a discount?" she thought.
When she announced that she would not formally carry out the campaign, she was completely overwhelmed by her emotions – as an expression of gratitude to the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it harder for her to raise money and focus on the voters rather than on the delegates, and out of anger over sexism, she became so full of herself.
"You might think I had a nervous breakdown," Ms. Schroeder said of how the press reacted to her.
“And you might think that my main sponsor was Kleenex.
I remember thinking about what they'd write on my gravestone.
"Crying"?
Why China-U.S. trade war could be good for Beijing
The initial salvo of the U.S.-China trade war was deafening, and although the battle is far from over, experts say the split between the countries is long-term beneficial to Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump issued the first warning this year by taxing Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
Most of the major escalations, however, saw the light of day this week when new tariffs on $200 billion (<0xC2><0xA3>150 billion) worth of goods were announced, effectively taxing half of China’s trade exports to the US.
Beijing has responded every time, most recently by imposing tariffs on five to ten percent of the 60 billion imports of U.S. goods.
China has been trying to reverse the U.S. with the same coin, and it is unlikely that the world’s second-largest economy will bow to its knees.
Even if China wanted Washington to return to its original tracks, it would have meant giving in to its demands, but publicly submitting to US demands would have been utterly humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts think that if Beijing could play its cards right, the US trade war could positively support China in the long run because it would reduce the interdependence of the two economies.
“The fact is that a quick political decision by Washington or Beijing could create economic conditions that would trigger an economic upheaval in both countries. This is far more dangerous than observers have ever admitted,” said Abigail Grace, a research associate at the Center for American Tank Security in New think.
Syria is ready for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria says it is prepared for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help in rebuilding a country devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today's situation on the ground is more stable and safer thanks to progress in the fight against terrorism," he said.
The government continues to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists into normal conditions.
All conditions are now met for the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave the country as a result of terrorism, as well as unilateral economic measures that have focused on their daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million people have left Syria since the start of the war in 2011.
Another six million people still live in the country with the need for humanitarian aid.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome any help in building a devastated country.
He stressed, however, that he would not accept conditional aid or aid from countries that sponsored the insurgents.
Europe has responded strongly to the victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
Evria won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National on the edge of trouble in France.
The U.S. has now lost the Ryder Cup in Europe for the sixth time in a row since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team reached the 14.5 points needed to defeat the US.
U.S. star Phil Mickelson, who struggled most of the tour, then threw the ball into the water at 3 pairs of 16 holes and conceded victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari then shone in all his rounds and became one of the 4 players and achieved the best result 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament was approved in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was defeated by 5 and 4 players of the European team with the lowest rating, Thorbjorn Olesen from Denmark.
The world's highest-ranked player Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to Ian Poulter of England, who had probably completed his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia has become the best European player overall with 25.5 points earned in his career.
“I don’t usually cry, but I can’t help myself today.
It's been a rough year.
So thanks to Thomas for choosing me and trusting me.
I'm so happy, really happy, that I got the cup back.
It all depends on the team, I'm glad I was able to help," Garcia said after Europe's win.
He handed the cup to his compatriot John Ramp, who defeated American legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, but I grew up watching that guy," Rahm said.
Woods lost all four games in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Strange statistics of one of the best players of all time, who won 14 biggest titles, with which only Jack Nicklaus can compare.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find the fairway, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who performed top-notch golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. Captain Jim Furyk, after the unsatisfactory results of his team, said: “I’m proud of the guys, they really fought.
This morning we really warmed Europe at heart.
We really didn't make it.
I'm squeezing my hat in front of Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played really well.
We will regroup and move forward in cooperation with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee.
I like those 12 guys, I'm glad I could make them captain.
I really need to get a grip.
You’ve played us.”
Red tide update: Concentrations are declining in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota counties
The latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission points to a total drop in concentrations of the red tide in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, stains of flowering water are now reported from the districts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier – this indicates a decreasing concentration.
The blooming water of the red tide has a range of about 130 miles of coastline from the northern district of Pinellas to the southern district of Lee.
Spots were observed about 10 miles off the coast in Hillsborough County, but last week it was already relatively fewer places.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Last week, medium concentrations were reported at the coast or on the high seas at the district of Pinellas. In the district of Hillsborough, low to high concentrations were observed at the high seas, lowest to high concentrations at the district of Manatee, lowest to high concentrations at the high seas, and highest concentrations at the high seas.
Respiratory irritation continues to occur in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Irritation of the airways was not reported in northwest Florida last week.
