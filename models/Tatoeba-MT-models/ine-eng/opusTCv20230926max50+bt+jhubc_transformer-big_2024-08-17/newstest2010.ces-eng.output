Barack Obama will receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth president of the United States.
U.S. President Barack Obama will arrive in Oslo for 26 hours to take over the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president in history.
The $1.4 million diploma, medals and cheque will be awarded, among other things, for exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House will arrive in the Norwegian metropolis in the morning with his wife Michelle and will be busy.
He will first visit the Nobel Institute, where he will meet for the first time with five members of the committee, who selected him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The presidential couple then have a scheduled meeting with King Harald V of Norway and Queen Sonja of Norway.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremonial ceremony at which Obama will receive a prestigious award.
He will be the fourth U.S. president to win the award, but only the third to win it directly in office.
The White House has already warned that Obama will talk about the Afghan war when he receives the award.
The president does not want to avoid this topic, because he realizes that he takes the prize as president, who is currently at war in two countries.
The war effort a few days ago increased even more by sending more troops to Afghanistan, which will not forget to emphasize any of its critics.
During the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, diploma and cheque for ten million Swedish crowns (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to put it for charitable purposes, but has not yet decided on a specific charity.
The President will then be introduced to the banquet, where, in addition to the King and Queen of Norway, the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests will be present.
From the very beginning, Obama has been more cautious about price.
He said, for example, that he felt he did not fully deserve it.
Several times he also repeated that it is not just a price for him, but for all those who strive for the same value as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said he was "calling for action".
Conservationist Accused of Extortion
Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice police have accused the president of the civil association Society of Nature Conservation of Litom<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0x99>ice of extortion.
In several cases in the past year, he appealed to some construction management, for the withdrawal of the appeal he asked investors for money for his benefit, said Litomer police spokesman Alena Romov<0xC3><0xA1>.
The Chairman of the Litomeric Society of Nature Conservationists is Lubom<0xC3><0xAD>r Studni<0xC4><0x8D>ka.
He is now in prison and faces up to three years in prison.
Sorting containers Brno does not smell very much
In Prague, ordinary people can sort their packaging from drinks, in the South Moravian villages you will meet sorting containers at every step.
And in Brno?
There to spare a few minutes before you find the right sink.
I am not saying that waste should not be disposed of at all in Brno.
But it seems to me that the fact that we are the second largest city in the republic, the councillors are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is in the forest waste sorting league not only by the fact that as citizens we can still throw only paper, glass and plastic into sorting containers, but above all by the number of garbage bins for such waste.
Have you ever tried, for example, throwing a PET bottle into a collection basket in the centre?
It's a ready-made cucumber, mainly it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I’ve come across so far is in Moravian Square opposite Potrefené Husa.
Don't let Mr. Onderka and his colleagues get mad at me, but I don't give a damn.
Not to mention the fact that in other parts of the world there is no sorting of waste.
A lot of my friends don't like waste management.
Laziness.
They're too far from the trash cans.
I'm not surprised.
After the party, I offered to throw away a couple of glass and plastic bottles.
But on Kounicova street I did not see any colored ashtray in sight.
Fortunately, I came across the right place on my way to the country side.
However, the waste from it overflowed.
After all, it is still the center of Brno, which perhaps represents the city the most, right?!
But the ecology and some aesthetics of the Brno socialists are of little interest.
Those cities would rather buy a hockey extra league that would shame us all over the republic than buy a few extra containers and offer sorting of other raw materials for cleaner Brno.
I am glad that I was able to confirm my assumption after a while browsing the Internet and official statistics.
According to EKO-KOM, Brno is the worst in the entire South Moravian Region.
"Paroubk's" budget took money for pensions and sick leave
After the left has added in spite of the government’s opinion to farmers or officials, there may not be money in the budget for pensions, sickness or building savings.
But also on interest on public debt or on international litigation.
This will cause problems for those who will rule in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed for a raise for some groups, they relied on a sensitive spending, pension, or sick government to lend extra money. "It's just putting problems off in the future, putting mines," says Janota.
After all, the borrowed money pays higher and higher interest rates and sometimes has to be returned.
The state has no power to choose where to take it.
If they do not reduce social benefits or the cost of running the state, they must raise taxes.
To all those to whom the left has now added: firemen, teachers, farmers.
And later, their children.
Pensions or sickness benefits, of which 1.8 billion have disappeared from the account, people do not have to fear, they will get them.
However, at the cost of being more indebted to the state – next year will not be missing in the treasury only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will grow faster and with it the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay for it and it will no longer be enough to slightly increase VAT or reduce the maternity rate, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the transfer of money in favor of several groups of voters, next year will also be missing five billion for the construction of highways and railways.
These are mainly already competitive and deployed sections, which can not be redesigned and, if necessary, discounted.
The best way is to reserve, which is also not free.
This means delaying or halting thirty large buildings, and the pumping of European money is also at risk, warns the spokesman of the Ministry of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
<0xC4><0x8C>SSD proposed that the loss of money be solved by shalamunsky – it reaches the dividends of <0xC4><0x8C>EZ, which the state mostly owns, and from them the transport fund will contribute.
The problem is that the amount of dividend is never certain, and it is no longer a pointless source.
Last year, <0xC4><0x8C>EZ entered the budget of 18 billion.
Every year, dividends are paid for the elimination of environmental damage, supplementing the pension account or serving as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
Moreover, this trick under EU rules increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP.
But the carnival doesn’t end there.
Nearly three billion were lost in the budget to various compensations for victims of communism and crime, or to expenses for litigation, even for building savings.
If he can do without that money, he’s not sure.
It's a lottery.
If we lose an international dispute, we’ll have to pay for it anyway,” Janota said.
The minister will then have to save money inside the department or at worst reach the government budget reserve.
One hundred million are also missing from the already launched two billion dollar project of the State Treasury, which is supposed to allow online monitoring of what the individual authorities are spending.
The first phase starts in January.
If the finance minister could not find the money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions will come, warns Janota.
Your next smartphone will handle two operating systems
Americans in the future rely on a mobile phone, on which the user will switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The revealed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and from Windows Mobile you will be transferred to Android within seconds.
This is precisely the goal of the American company VMware, which focuses mainly on the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your mobile.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will be working at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was first shown a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smartphones is not a fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM of 128 MB, which was running alongside the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. operators to test the virtualization of smartphones, and the devices are expected to reach customers during 2012.
Lack of snow on the mountains bothers hoteliers
The bare slopes are not only of concern to the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e skiers.
The lack of snow also discourages people from booking ski stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That is why in the Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter dates including Christmas and New Year’s Eve.
We have a lot of visitors to our site.
People go through offers, find out prices, but so far they are afraid to order.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or mud," said Spindl.Info information portal operator Martin Jandura.
If you want to stay in Spindleruv Mlyn exactly according to your ideas, you should not hesitate to order.
If you prefer to save money and the quality of accommodation is second only to him, he can still try to wait a few days.
So far, Spindler Hoteliers offer mostly only weekly stays on New Year’s Eve.
I think they'll try to give it up for a while, but then they'll let it go and go for a short time.
And then the free rooms will quickly disappear," Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter periods are still offered by the top travel agency Ingtours.
Now we are most interested in the Christmas week, which has not yet been sold out.
Half of the seats on our offer remain vacant.
That’s why we’ve already booked some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute,” said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains can still be offered by the top travel agency, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fourteen days of February are also good for sales, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year’s interest in winter stays negatively affects the fact that there is still no snow in the Giant Mountains.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If it snows during the week, Christmas will be sold out," says Schiefert.
On the contrary, a little better than last year manages to occupy the rooms of the Hotel Horizont in Pec pod Sn<0xC4><0x9B><0xC5><0xBE>kou.
We're about five percent better at it.
We have the last few spots on New Year's Eve and Christmas.
There is great interest in the Polish holidays in January and it is also selling well in February," said Karel Rada, director of the best Pec hotel.
Out of eighty percent of New Year’s Eve stays, the Omnia hotel is also occupied by the central parking lot in Janské L<0xC3><0xA1>zn<0xC4><0x9B>.
On the contrary, at Christmas, half of the beds remain free in the latest Janskolasen hotel.
We were pleasantly surprised this year by a January, which we already have about sixty percent occupied at the moment.
February is a little weaker so far, but once it snows, the interest in staying in the Giant Mountains will certainly increase, said the director of the Omnia Hotel Erik Sporysch.
However, for the greater part of the snow, the Krkono<0xC5><0xA1>e hoteliers still have to let their taste go.
It's supposed to be cool on Thursday if there's any rain, so there should be snow on the mountains.
But then the warming is to come again, informed Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Jakubsk<0xC3><0xBD> from the castle workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
USA: Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is only comical that Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of the smartest, repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, which he himself considered the stupidest.
When he finally debunked his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he had written it through a copycat from Bush’s Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he did not even hesitate to use the name of Bush's January 2007 statement as the title of his own declaration: "A New Way Forward."
At the same time, he himself criticized Bush’s idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to Iraq suffering from civil war as “irresponsible and, in its aftermath, catastrophic.”
The following months, however, showed that Bush’s strategy based on the recommendations of the field commanders was the only one that was possible and successful enough that there is no mention of Iraq in the news reports today.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, but he objectively left his successor a much more appreciative initial situation than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will happen again.
He was again asked by field commanders to increase the military contingent, especially the top commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, even despite the subordination custom, harshly criticized the hesitant shooters in the White House.
He asked 40,000 men to break the situation for the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he didn't think of anything better, so at least he fooled the general with 10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he was able to make a promise of another 5,000, even though he had originally counted at least 10.
The most problematic thing about Obama’s entire strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in as little as 18 months and to end the process within three years. The whole Obama doctrine raises more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubt that a half-fold increase will produce the same results as the Iraq procedure.
Despite the fratricidal wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well organized, its leaders honor the agreement.
The Afghan situation is marked by the opposite symptom - no one can be trusted and no agreements are respected.
Under these conditions, the Afghan security forces, accustomed every day to change the master according to how it suits them.
Political institutions, even if formally established, will remain only a shadowy village, behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely difficult due to the lack of transparency in the relations that further complicate Pakistan’s and Iran’s influence.
Even building an “actionable state,” which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, doesn’t seem too realistic.
The timing of Obama’s strategy is striking with his voluntarism.
The situation in Afghanistan has only worsened over the past eight years and is now on the verge of an explosion.
Believing that the soldiers sent to war in order to "quickly return home" will cause the miracle done here, only the soul can truly romantic, untouched reality.
From a political point of view, setting the date of the withdrawal of troops is a clear irresponsibility, as the Taliban will see it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is declining.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the Hindu Kush foothills.
Another factor capable of radically affecting the situation is the development of events around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the increased sanctions on Iran do not take effect, the difficult question will arise before the United States whether to try to solve the problem by military force.
It will be necessary to respond to it at a time when, according to Obama, the United States will proceed to a successful withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation.
The only downside for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years left in the presidential election, and therefore enough time left for him to come up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
Goldman Sachs Bank Managers Will No Longer Receive Cash Rewards
U.S. bank Goldman Sachs executives will not receive cash rewards this year.
This was announced by the company, which reacts to the harsh criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 senior managers will get shares that can be sold in five years’ time instead of the money.
In addition, shares can be withdrawn from managers if they take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to combine Wall Street rewards with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the broader direction it needs to go, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after sidestepping nearly $17 billion (nearly $300 billion) in rewards in the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of remuneration in the company for this year, according to Reuters, is likely to exceed $20 billion, despite the measure announced today.
High wages in the banking sector have become a hot political topic in many countries with the onset of the financial crisis.
Britain announced on Wednesday that it intends to charge bankers bonuses exceeding <0xC2><0xA3>25,000 (about <0xC2><0xA3>712,000) one-time for a 50% tax.
France is also taking similar steps.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics.
A record five women in Stockholm today were awarded this year’s Nobel Prize in Professional Categories and Literature by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.
In addition to four scientists among them was the German writer of Romanian origin Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>llerov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with their compatriot Jack Szostak, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The award for chemistry was given to Israeli Ada Jonath along with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for clarifying the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last winner was the Nobel Prize in Economics, won by Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went around without a holder this year was physics.
Charles Kao and George Smith and Willard Boyle won the prize for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, faxes or astronomical telescopes.
Each recipient received a diploma, a Nobel medal, and a certificate of financial reward.
For each category, it reaches ten million Swedish crowns (about 25 million CZK).
If there are more awards in each of them, the reward is divided between them.
Traditionally, the most anticipated Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to US President Barack Obama this afternoon in Oslo, Norway.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversy surrounding his award, as he is just at the beginning of his career and is also at the forefront of a country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But in defense of his policy, he added that in a certain situation, wars are necessary for peace, even if the price for it is high.
Minister Janota is considering resigning. Klaus invited him to the Castle
President V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Klaus will host Finance Minister Eduard Janota on Friday morning, who is considering staying in the government because he does not agree with the shape of the state budget for next year as approved by the Chamber of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is assumed that the budget and possibly even Janot's stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
He says the deficit is too high, further exacerbating the public finances crisis.
The meeting was briefed by the president's spokesman, Radim Ochvat.
Janota wants to discuss her further stay in office with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the budget law, which will now get Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
On Wednesday, however, the House approved proposals by the left to move money and raise money to pay civil servants, run social services and pay farmers directly.
The government blamed the proposals of social democracy for secretly increasing the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other hand, a sharp domestic dispute has arisen because of this, which is why the question about the further action of Fischer's cabinet of officials begins to arise, the formation of which was agreed in the spring by the ODS, the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD and the Party of Soviet Socialist Republics.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by the House, essentially liquidates a package of austerity measures that the Fischer government pushed in the fall and which it says is meant to stop government debt.
Klaus, who may or may not sign the state budget law, said at a breakfast discussion with businessmen today that politicians had long neglected the “serious problem” of an “unsustainable deficit” in public finances.
According to him, he no longer has a good solution.
Only a strong government could bring improvements, which could also rely on a broader consensus of political parties, according to the president.
ODS President Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek said that the budget is frightening and the government should consider further existence.
Deputy Chairman of the ODS Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as told <0xC4><0x8C>TK that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Greens is clearly no longer working.
In response, Prime Minister Fischer called similar words "strong statements".
Head of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD Ji<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD> Paroubek reacted to Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nka by saying that the budget deficit prepared by the former Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nka government for this year, which will exceed 200 billion crowns, is appalling.
On Wednesday, <0xC4><0x8C>SSD declared the approval of the state budget for next year a success.
The people were also satisfied.
Mandel was played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood's novel.
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus: The Undefeated will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggle and its victories, despite some criticism that the main roles are played by American actors.
The story is about sport, race and Nelson Mandela.
A tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in the South African Republic and its first black president Nelson Mandela in his life story, he is portrayed by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said Mandela, 90, asked if he could portray him in Eastwood's film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, 'If I'm going to play you, I'm going to have to have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood’s drama Million Dollar Baby, has already portrayed, for example, the leader of the movement for the abolition of slavery, from which he eventually became a slave, the fictional president of the United States and even the god in Divine Evan, but he is still very, very important.
A former South African statesman has been in prison for 27 years for his active work in ending apartheid in the South African Republic.
He was released from prison in 1990 and became president for four years.
In 1993, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for undefeated and is the name of the poem by the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unify the country. Mandela’s newly elected president knows that his nation still remains racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes that he can connect his people through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players who belong worldwide among outsiders.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela's story on screen.
“I had no other goal than to play this role so that I could bring it as close to reality as possible,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to talk like him.
The actor said that if he and world politicians were from the same area, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandel's hand.
I found that when I squeezed your hand, I took your energy, transferred it, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It’s important for me to try to become a different person.
Matt Damon portrays Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar, the captain of a national rugby team dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A big surprise for him was finally when he first met Pienaar at his home.
I remember ringing the doorbell, he opened it, and the first thing I said to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Pienaar in my life was, ‘I look a lot bigger in the movie.’
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their real-life counterparts under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus: Undefeated has received positive reviews and talks about the ambitions for the Oscars.
Film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment in the words: “It was a very good story, a very well made film.”
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
The secret of the glow over Norway dissolved: the Russians tested the rocket
Above Norway it was possible to observe a special light effect of unknown origin.
The Russian Defense Ministry admitted only yesterday that it was testing an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian borders.
However, the launch was again unsuccessful and the shot, referred to as the "Bulava" type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, slowly became a black nightmare of Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even its repeated presence in the missile tests did not have an appropriate effect on the success of the test flights.
Bulava usually did not take off at all or was damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers, it is already written about "Bulava" as a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly but shines
This, in turn, was the 13th attempt in the beginning.
At the end of the flight, the aircraft was damaged again.
Apparently, the engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time the Bulava was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was sailing under the White Sea.
This type of missile allows firing from a vessel that is in motion and at the same time submerged.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by a closer unspecified flying object was indeed a broken "Bulava".
From the very beginning, the Norwegians had no doubt that it was a Russian missile.
This time, the generals defend themselves and claim that we cannot speak unequivocally about failure.
The first two stages of the rocket lasted and the accident hit the third.
In the previous cases, the engines broke right in the first stage.
Although not a single test launch has taken place without any errors, only six out of thirteen consider the defense ministry to be unsuccessful.
Almost fifty percent of the generals’ success is therefore met with optimism, and so they still claim that “Bulava” will fly without problems once and that it will even take up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Legendary Fetisov signed an annual contract at CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Vyacheslav Fetisov will once again present himself in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner will help his CSKA Moscow team in the emergency and will probably enter the KHL duel against St. Petersburg on Friday.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kulja<0xC5><0xA1> is injured, we need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trains and agreed to help the team.
We just need to solve some formal problems, the AP quoted coach of the Moscow club Sergei N<0xC4><0x9B>m<0xC4><0x8D>inov.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will concern only one match.
I think that Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirits of other players, said the German.
According to the AP, Fetisov will become the oldest Russian professional ice hockey player.
In the NHL, he played for Hartford's legendary forward Gordie Howe for the entire season, scoring 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the jersey of the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic golds, seven world championship titles, and won the Canada Cup and the Junior World Championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where in the Detroit jersey he twice lifted over the head of the Stanley Cup.
He has been a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame since 2001.
Hyundai has satisfied the unions. It will cancel all overtime
The management of Hyundai has agreed with the unions to cancel all overtime.
It was because of the often ordered overtime that the unions declared a strike emergency on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai spokesman Petr Van<0xC4><0x9B>k.
However, the management wants to agree with the experts on one more Saturday shift this year.
We cannot give up on our production plan, it is essential, so it was designed voluntarily overtime on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts being made, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
Server Sedmi<0xC4><0x8D>ka.cz wrote that the company of employees who work out the Saturday shift offered a bonus of 400 CZK.
People will get it back on Saturday, November 28th.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the way employees are motivated for overtime.
They will either have to pay a surcharge for overtime or they can choose a substitute holiday on December 28, and thus extend the Christmas holidays by a day, Van<0xC4><0x9B>k said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will receive paid fares and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and urgent point in terms of the comments and complaints of the professionals, as well as the protesting employees, who stopped production last week, the management yesterday afternoon decided with immediate effect to cancel all monthly overtime.
Until last week, the employees of the car company were forced to work another two hours overtime almost every day after an eight-hour shift.
After signing the agreement, the unions will call off the strike urgency
Further negotiations between the management of the automaker and the experts are scheduled to take place on Friday morning.
Head of trade unions Petr Kucha<0xC5><0x99> said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation in the carmaker escalated last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
The management reiterated that overtime must be done by employees in order to meet the requirements for the delivery of cars.
The trade unionists also demanded in their Monday’s strike notice that no sanctions be imposed on employees who stopped production last Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, trade unions demand that the company reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a reward of 5000 crowns for her this year.
Hyundai’s trucking company now employs 2,000 people.
The company started mass production in November last year.
By September of this year, it produced about 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also takes on 'used' HIV viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also takes on viruses that have already gained immunity against drugs.
This fact in some cases outweighs the fact that the compound on the common variant of the virus does not work as strongly as some already available drugs.
AIDS is not yet curable.
However, patients can significantly prolong the life of a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the multiplication of the virus also results in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which the drugs are no longer effective.
The work of experts from the three institutes of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, from the University of Applied Sciences Prague and from the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the resistance of the virus.
They have shown that substances called metallocarborans act on a protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metal carboranes are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all the drugs used today, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new ‘improved’ compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to viral protein.
Metal carboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages made up of boron atoms, hydrogen and carbon are connected by a metal atom, in this case by cobalt.
Betrayal and resistant virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus, which is necessary for the life cycle of the virus.
Without HIV protease caused by HIV virus cleavage, no mature infectious virus particles would be produced.
When we stop HIV protease, we will also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the researchers explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is further systematically modified.
Slightly weaker but more reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease was tested in a test tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from patients infected with HIV.
The effect of metallocarborans on the normal variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and also their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical modifications both from metallocarborans make interesting compounds for further research aimed at the design of effective anti-HIV drugs, says Pavl<0xC3><0xAD>na <0xC5><0x98>ez<0xC3><0xA1><0xC4><0x8D>ov<0xC3><0xA1>, Head of the Laboratory of Biochemistry of the Structure of Biochemistry and the Head of the Laboratory of Biogenetics.
Dispute over budget. The ODS has joined Fischer, he is defending
The head of the SDO Mirek Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek called the approved budget for next year "terrible" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider a further existence.
The ODS statement was described by the Prime Minister as strong statements.
He said he has time for analysis.
Deputy Chairman of the ODS Petr Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as said that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, ODS and the Green Party is clearly no longer working.
According to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as, the Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to base himself in the House on a minority that is fighting a growing deficit, or whether he wants to remain in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the SDGs and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different, Ne<0xC4><0x8D>as pointed out.
The House on Wednesday adopted a budget for 2010, but with left-wing amendments worth more than 12 billion crowns.
The House increased the money for salaries of state employees, for the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government’s fallacy towards the proposals of social democracy was that they were secretly increasing the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of CZK 163 billion.
The SDGs left the Chamber before the vote, thus satisfying the government's wish that even the amended budget is a less bad option than the budget provisional.
Disappointment and vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and a sense of futility, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government would still assess the current situation.
Some time ago, it was believed that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign if the amendments were adopted, the situation might have looked different.
According to Czech Television, Janota was ordered to the prime minister on Monday after the government.
He indicated that he was considering a further stay in office.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks out for another fight with budget deficit, according to Ne<0xC4><0x8D>a in the government they have nothing to do with the nominees of <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, which pushed for changes in the budget.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House approves other deficit-enhancing laws, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or an amendment to the service law.
Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek: Ministers nominated by the ODS did not fail
This is a matter for Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek stressed in a text message from the US.
He recalled that in several ministries there are people in the post office who are reporting to the TOP 09, which voted against the budget.
Some time ago he stressed that if Fischer decides to resign on the principle of combating the level of public deficit, "it is absolutely logical and correct that he will rely on the left-wing majority that is currently in the House."
But he said he could not count on the support and tolerance of the civil democrats.
I did not think about it, and when it is up-to-date, I will do so, Defense Minister Martin Bart<0xC3><0xA1>k told reporters in the House, which was nominated by the civilian Democrats in the government.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to the European Council meeting in Brussels.
At the request of the Prime Minister, the ODS resigned.
At the same time, he stressed that the SDGs would probably vote against the amended budget on Wednesday in the House if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask the MPs of the Civic Democrats to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel like orphans, we are not small children, he then responded to the question whether the SDGs did not hinder the absence of the party president in the parliament and the Czech Republic during the political negotiations on the budget.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
Even when I gave up on the mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily about the Bolsheviks’ dissolution of the House and the destruction of everything positive, Topol<0xC3><0xA1>nek himself responded.
Under the new <0xC4><0x8C>D rules, fewer trains will run for almost the same fare
From 13 December, the Czech Railways will cancel or limit some less-exhausted speedometers and locales, while other connections will be strengthened.
From the date of entry into force of the new timetable, the total transport volume will be reduced by two per cent compared to today.
Most of the fares, including the basic and customer fare, will not change.
For example, the inhabitants of Ostrava will get more options to connect to the capital, the tracks on this route will add one set of pendolino.
On the contrary, the express train will stop driving to Bratislava.
There are also fewer express trains on the Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice route, with direct connections between Prague and Letohrad being limited.
The regions are planning the largest reduction in transport in the Kralovehradeck<0xC3><0xBD> region, a total of eight percent, while Prague and the surrounding area can enjoy the increase.
There are also two night trains on the route Prague - T<0xC3><0xA1>bor - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice and the operation of several speed trains on the route Prague - P<0xC3><0xAD>sek - <0xC4><0x8C>eské Bud<0xC4><0x9B>jovice is limited to a few days a week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovic to Prague, today Milovi<0xC4><0x8D>t<0xC3><0xAD> has to transfer to Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the suburban system Esko, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of electrification of the line from Lys<0xC3><0xA1> nad Labem to Milovic.
The long-distance connections to the capital will end at the destination station Prague Hlavn<0xC3><0xAD> n<0xC3><0xA1>dra<0xC5><0xBE><0xC3><0xAD>.
<0xC4><0x8C>D will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to <0xC5><0xA0>umperka/Jesen<0xC3><0xAD>k will run at two-hour intervals.
Passengers will no longer travel to Bratislava by pendoline from 13 December.
This year's regional rail account: 200 million more
The Ministry of Transport orders and pays for the rapids, in total to compensate for the so-called demonstrable losses it will give to the railways next year four billion crowns, as well as this year. Locals order the regions, in total they will pay eight billion crowns for them next year, while the state will contribute less than three billion crowns.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The tracks have a new ten-year contract for both locales and expressways, so far the contract has always been for one year.
The tracks praise the system, which is why they apparently failed to raise the prices of the vast majority of tickets.
Changes will only be made for one-day network tickets <0xC4><0x8C>D Net and cheap eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka online tickets.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of <0xC4><0x8C>D Net will increase from CZK 450 to CZK 600.
The price of eLi<0xC5><0xA1>ka will be new from the distance taken, so far it was uniform for the trip between any regional cities and amounted to 160 crowns.
Philippine Armed Forces Detain More Than 50 People, Children Released
Armed forces in the southern Philippines have kidnapped 75 people, including several elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by AFP, which originally reported only 65 prisoners.
All 17 detained children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The kidnapping took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 gunmen are said to be using the hostages as a living shield when fleeing the police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the armed forces belong to the New People's Army (NPA), which is an armed component of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to the AP, the police originally pursued the kidnapper because of the violence, which required the settlement of accounts between two local family clans.
In the south of the Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, a martial law has been declared due to the recent massacre that killed 57 people.
Among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the election to the governor's office were 30 journalists.
On suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of the South Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan family, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on the island of Mindanao.
On Tuesday, however, they resumed peace talks with the Philippine government.
The story of JAR concerns everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Mandela
In the coming days, Clint Eastwood's new Hollywood film Invictus (officially Invictus: Undefeated), which captures part of the life story of former South African President Nelson Mandela, will be released in theaters.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was played by Morgan Freeman, who is said to have chosen Mandela for his portrayal years ago.
The supporting male role of legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar was played by Matt Damon.
With the introduction of the film to cinemas, they emerge from the voices of critics and the public
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988, he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993, together with de Klerk, the Nobel Peace Prize.
He was President of the Republic of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
There are high expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when preparations for the World Cup in South Africa are on the rise, but at the same time the media are shaken by disturbing reports of growing racial hatred and discrimination of the population by the ruling black majority.
According to the AP news agency, the announcements for the new film in the JAR are so far largely positive, despite numerous reservations about the cast of the main roles of the "sparky" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of his new film.
I had dreamed of this role for many years and was well prepared for it.
I have also met Nelson Mandela many times in person in order to draw his energy, as they say, in an interview after the film’s celebratory premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can recall Mandela's personality and message with the film.
This is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but it concerns every person, he added.
In the jersey of the national rugby team
Based on a book by British author John Carlin entitled In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation portrays a South African human rights defender during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman tries to reconcile two racial and long-defined groups of the population and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also takes on the role of actor in the South African national rugby jersey for the World Cup, which JAR won at the time.
For entering the lawn in a suit, which in the JAR is understood almost as something sacred, Mandela collected fourteen years ago a great ovation mainly from the white audience and gained recognition from the white population.
The football championship may be able to reunite people into one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in the JAR will improve will only be shown.
However, white South Africans are skeptical, as revealed in a recent interview for the LN by rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship will begin on June 11, 2010.
In Lounsk, a transformer burns for tens of millions of crowns
The fire was caught in the morning by a transformer of <0xC4><0x8C>eps company in a distribution center near the village of V<0xC3><0xBD><0xC5><0xA1>kov in Lounsk.
According to the spokesman of the <0xC3><0x9A>st<0xC3><0xAD> regional firefighters Luk<0xC3><0xA1><0xC5><0xA1> Marvan, six units intervened in the fire.
Initially, the firefighters wanted the transformer to be burned, but later reassessed the opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and special fire retardants.
The cause was a technical malfunction, an internal shortcut of the transformer.
No one was injured, according to a spokesman for the company Pavly Mand<0xC3><0xA1>tov<0xC3><0xA1> does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, accurately quantifying it will succeed only after the end of the fire.
According to the Mandate, the destroyed transformer will need to be replaced with a new one.
In the ten years of operation of <0xC4><0x8C>eps, nothing similar has happened, defects of this type are unique, she added.
According to a spokesperson for <0xC4><0x8C>EZ for Northern Bohemia, Soni Holingerov<0xC3><0xA1> Hendrychov<0xC3><0xA1>, electricity supplies were not interrupted, and the operation of households, offices and companies was not affected by the fire.
A.s. <0xC4><0x8C>eps operates on the territory of the Czech Republic as the exclusive operator of the transmission system, electrical lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 plants with 67 transformers transferring electrical energy from the transmission system to the distribution system and the line routes with a length of 4339 kilometers.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura files criminal notice for defamation against three <0xC4><0x8C>SSD chiefs
Student Agency owner Radim Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura today filed a criminal complaint for defamation against three Social Democratic governors.
Michal Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek from the South Moravian Region, Radko Mart<0xC3><0xAD>nek from the Pardubice Region and Martin Tesa<0xC5><0x99><0xC3><0xAD>k, the Governor of the Olomouc Region.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura put it in the Radio Journal's Twenty Minutes.
The complaint relates to the company’s efforts to operate regional train services in some regions.
However, all regions eventually signed long-term contracts with Czech Railways.
All three governors are attacking us and talking about choosing raisins, while we have brought an offer only for what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true, because we know the prices of the Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
So all we have to do is defend ourselves.
It's an insult to Student Agency, he told Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ur Radio.
At the same time, he said he had evidence from all regions that they had not taken action in accordance with European law.
It is therefore preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek considers filing a criminal complaint as a continuation of Mr. Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura’s media show, which serves as an unpaid advertisement for his company and his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of my country and my region, and to the same challenge as the other governors.
I assume that even on this occasion it will be clear that it is Mr Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura who manipulates the public in the matter of regional rail transport and uses false and false arguments, said Ha<0xC5><0xA1>ek.
Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura announced last week that he is investing several million crowns in an ad that will warn the regions of an unfavorable move.
He told the radio that the campaign after Christmas will stop and wants to continue after the New Year.
He said the campaign would be against corruption as such.
The campaign started in Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura after the regions agreed to operate regional railway links with Czech Railways and did not issue tenders for a contract of around 150 billion crowns.
According to Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ura, similar conduct is illegal and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Due to the criticism of train transport in the regions, Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ur was already threatened by a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD.
The only threat was that if we don't stop, we could lose the bus license.
He introduced himself as a member of the <0xC4><0x8C>SSD, I know who the master is, I will not say his name, he told the Jan<0xC4><0x8D>ur Radio Journal today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease since January will break old habits.
It should be the first for families free and at the same time optional.
But voices are already calling for mandatory vaccinations to be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococci peak.
The Institute of Medicine already sets the maximum prices for vaccines to be paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are also clear on the vaccination process.
New Vaccinations
Free vaccinations for August children
From January, children born on August 2nd and later can be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease free of charge.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of the vaccine.
Those who started vaccinations last year or earlier will have to pay for other vaccinations themselves.
The first dose should be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children voluntarily vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1,600 crowns for one dose and more.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies will spend 300 to 450,000 crowns per year on vaccination doses.
But it will save on the treatment that children without vaccinations would need.
So far, the state has given about 500,000 a year to all children who are vaccinated.
Vaccinations have been introduced with the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcal causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain membranes and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infection in our country in a year, according to a survey in hospitals, up to 28 children under 10 years of age will die.
In addition to the Czech Republic, they introduced paid vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease in about 40 countries.
Will vaccinations be mandatory?
At the same time, however, there are opinions that this vaccination could be mandatory in the future.
From January, it is to be paid by insurance companies and optional.
For example, the head of the civic association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovsk<0xC3><0xBD> suggested that mandatory vaccination would be better.
Its pneumococcal vaccine association promotes long-term.
Experts at the international conference attended by our association were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccinations.
It's not exactly ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in enforcing at least this.
"I think that's the path we have to take now," Kalovsky said.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcal disease.
At the moment, we are not thinking about it at all, said his spokesman Vlastimil Sr<0xC5><0xA1>e<0xC5><0x88>.
Vaccination has its drawbacks, say doctors
Hana Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>, President of the Society of Practical Pediatricians, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, a reduction in the number of revaccinations could be considered "For a situation where this vaccine costs such a high amount, we quite understand the political decision that the vaccination was started as voluntary," says Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Experts expect that from next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their babies vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also groundbreaking in that it is the first comprehensive vaccination of children paid for by health insurance companies, not the state.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, thus saving on further treatment, Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1> explains.
Doctors will have to buy the drugs themselves.
However, this is related to the concerns of practical pediatricians, which relate to the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original plan, the vaccines were to be purchased by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way as the state supplies them with substances for other vaccinations.
However, some MPs were concerned that insurance companies would be able to "extract money from health insurance".
Therefore, doctors will have to buy the drugs and wait for the insurance companies to pay them.
It is estimated that individual pediatricians will invest 40,000 per month in vaccines, which is a significant sum.
It will not be easy, says Cabrnochov<0xC3><0xA1>.
American artist's son 'stealed in a museum'
Frank Frazetta's son has been accused of attempting to steal $20 million (<0xC2><0xA3>12 million) worth of paintings from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 images into his vehicle and trailer.
Mr. Frazetta and the other man used the bagr to break into the museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta senior, aged 81, became famous for creating the characters of Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, according to the Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying Mr. Frazetta Jr. could have been motivated by long-standing family disputes.
Before the police, Mr Frazetta issued a younger, 52-year-old affidavit that he had done so at his father's direction, "to get to the museum in any way possible and move the paintings to the sweetening rooms," the agency said.
Mr Frazetta, Sr., refused to grant any such permission, the agency said.
Labour opposes planned tax hikes
The ministers defended the increase in taxes and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, businessmen and trade unions.
According to Alistair Darling, the Tory have “wasted” the opportunity to show that they are serious about delaying the deficit reduction decision until after the election.
Even the chancellor got under fire for the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, this is mainly a 0.5% increase in social security and 1% adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Dissatisfaction with social insurance
Trade unions protested that low-income workers were being punished for a recession they did not blame and warned of "problems" in advance.
Social security is on the rise - an increase of about <0xC2><0xA3>3 trillion a year - infuriating a community of entrepreneurs who said it was an employment tax, while the focus should be on rebuilding the economy.
This increase, which is limited to these incomes above <0xC2><0xA3>20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
KEY BODIES PBR
Social security will increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
The economic situation will deteriorate more than expected, by 4.75% this year
New Taxation of 50% of Bankers’ Bonuses
1% increase in corporate tax on write-offs for small businesses
Tax cuts for electric vehicles and wind power plants
Increase in pension measurement by 2.5%
According to government estimates, some <0xC2><0xA3>30,000 income will be reduced by <0xC2><0xA3>90 a year and some <0xC2><0xA3>40,000 income will be reduced by <0xC2><0xA3>190, while some <0xC2><0xA3>10,000 income will be increased by <0xC2><0xA3>110.
The ministers announced that their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "complex decision-making", but insisted that 60% of special taxes should fall to 5% of people with the highest incomes.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed increase in taxes and spending restrictions would be an "ocean drop" compared to what would need to be done.
"These are big numbers, which will allow us to cut the deficit by half, which is absolutely a basic requirement for the next four years," he told the BBC.
Mr Timms said he was confident that economic growth would occur at the turn of the year.
But making a forecast for future economic growth – which will affect the volume of loans needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced – must be taken into account after the chancellor has been forced to revise earlier amounts.
In that opinion, he said, the fall in the economy was 4.75% this year - far worse than the 3.5% drop predicted in April - because loans were <0xC2><0xA3>3 trillion higher than previously estimated.
"A wasted opportunity"
The Conservatives, who launched a new campaign on Thursday warning of a "debt crisis" by the Labour party, called the planned <0xC2><0xA3>789 trillion loan over the next six years "unbearable."
The ministers failed to present a credible plan for how this could be paid for, they added, "cynically" postponed this decision until after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that would be feasible," said Shadow Treasury Secretary Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts unlike the Tory proposals, which would like to reduce the deficit faster and to a greater extent.
But the Liberal Democrats argue that the money raised by raising taxes and cutting spending should be used to support spending next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that the plans are “built on sand.”
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said on the timing of the announcement - for example, the above inflation will rise and there will be an inability to pay benefits next April - that this could lead to accusations of the chancellor in the election campaign if the money was difficult to get back a year later.
But the Labour Party insists on providing special assistance if people need it very much and the situation will be revised by September 2010.
"Suspected Budget"
Although ministers did not release details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that a reduction in public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term restraints.
The well-recognized Institute of Budgetary Studies said the Chancellor’s figures indicate substantial cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education and defence in the future.
"It's really very painful so far," said its director Robert Chote.
“All the important statements will come after the election if we win them,” Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to the Deloitte bank, told Reuters.
"It was a report about a suspicious preliminary budget. Markets are implementing it."
FBI Investigates 'American Prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation in a Pakistani prison of five Americans suspected of links to extremists.
The men were arrested for attacking a house in Sargoda in eastern Punjab province, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said it was an investigation into whether the men were the same men who had been declared missing in the last month at their home in Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also about obtaining information about these men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one of them has Egyptian ancestry and the other is from Yemen.
“If they were U.S. citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and the circumstances under which they were detained,” Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the arrest and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are indeed missing students," she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men had been arrested in a house belonging to the uncle of one of them.
It stated that the house had always been in the interest of the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrest, Reuters reported, but said the United States must “cooperate much more closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan in uncovering the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people.”
The disappearance of these five students from their home in northern Virginia was announced by their families in late November.
Refusal of amnesty for Iran's torturers.
The human rights situation in Iran is just as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, according to an Amnesty International report.
The report describes in detail the “modes of torture” in the regime before and after the disputed presidential election in June.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was at risk of rape.
Iran has denied the above criticism of the report on human rights.
Officials described the criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people have been imprisoned and dozens killed after the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the biggest street demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of them have been sentenced to death, and prosecutors have sentenced the last five people to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran John Leyne, who is now in London, said earlier in the protests that Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini had declared the illegality of some forms of torture and banned their execution in the Karizak correctional facility.
But since then, almost no criticism of the rule of law has been tolerated, as our correspondent said.
"False Confession"
Amnesty International cited a report by 26-year-old computer technician Ibrahim Methari, who said he was accused of "working with the Facebook network" and protesting the election results.
"I've often been punched in the face," he said in the statement.
"They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... they threatened me with execution and humiliated me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left in the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, the defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroub<0xC3><0xAD> was detained after the protests after the elections and was tortured to death in prison and the others were raped.
Iran’s top state officials have denied accusations of rape, but admitted that torture was taking place.
Amnesty also cited a case of a former prisoner who said he was held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a Kahrizak prison.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and the judiciary had set up committees to investigate the government’s condolences and reactions, but said the mandate and powers of the authorities were unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees were not published.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further demonstrations.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow was used to turn a Bristol monument into a downhill track for the race.
The downhill track for the race in the park attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the ski slope in Brandon Hill Park was a short jump bridge in front of a 100 m long ski slope.
Fourth-year medical student John Hickman said it was a beautiful view from the top of the ski slope, but that it was really daunting.
It was a beautiful view of the flashing lights of the city below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country – some of them real talents.”
The prizes were awarded for the best pieces - or maneuvers on the downhill track.
After the Thursday night race, the snow was left to melt.
Still them and us
Can a Muslim be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on the construction of minarets and generally spreading horrendous reports of Europe’s alleged Islamization, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed and pondered whether Muslims could integrate – and integrate – into one of the most open societies in the world.
After reading this book, some of the readers became admirers of the author’s latest work, “Why the French Don’t Like Scarves on the Head” (2006), this elegant and debated study of controversial issues that divide and occupy the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen's latest book has a broader and much more ambitious scope.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what really happened in the background.
He spent months in mosques, schools, and institutes that now take care of 5 <0xC3><0x97> 6 million French Muslims, what Mr. Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students about the issues that worry them the most.
Should a Muslim enter a marital union in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gays?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Does a Muslim have the right to use an interest-based banking system to obtain a mortgage?
These are seemingly worldly controversial issues that are being discussed, and which are part of everyday life rather than political dramas that employ the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among others well-known persons, not excluding Tarik Ramadan, Arab, Muslim scholar and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion about how one can be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don’t have arguments for all their habits.
Conservatives are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
Philosophers and activists interviewed by Mr. Bowen are leaning towards the notion that this is a counterpoint to Selafi — supporters of the Sunni Islam purist group in Saudi Arabia — this group is small, but it affects European Muslims.
Mr Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adjustment requires compromises on both sides.
He asks himself how far French politicians (and the intellectual elite, who so zealously defend the lay public) are really committed to the idea of pluralism.
There is an opinion that Muslims have probably less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than developing pragmatism, he found “the tightening of the screws of values.”
Can a Muslim be French? After reading this book, someone may be inclined to say "Yes, but not now."
The World's Most Remarkable Prospects
The Arctic is changing more dramatically than the rest of the planet’s environment.
The limiting ice melts at an alarming rate, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fishing companies must be focused on new natural sources of water, together with diplomats, lawyers and writers upon their awakening.
In the book "On thin ice" Richard Ellis, writer and illustrator, depicts the natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear.
Well-acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whaling describes the long tradition of polar explorers who tried to capture a white bear.
The meeting of Admiral Nelson with a brave 14-year-old swimmer who fought only with a musketeer's flask is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
The young bears, who were swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers, were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears appeared in one circus tent.
Even today, the enclosures in the zoo typically have an area a million times smaller than the area available to adult individuals in the wild. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America, and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where he hunts helicopters and Indians on skis, and all are armed with powerful assault handcuffs to shoot off their prey.
Ironically, it happens in the water north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book, “After Ice,” Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and unsatisfied responsibility for science in the Arctic and an eye-catching glimpse into how the future can change it.
Not all scientists have the answers.
Even meteorologists and oceanographers do not have an adequate response to the speed of change.
That's for lack of testing.
Fridtjof Nansen’s research trips in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first indicated how floating ice is moving.
The Cold War submarines then mapped out the shifting divisions as they submerged them.
Satellite exploration and the extensive field probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still held thanks to the unendangered individuals camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the fallout system <0xCC><0x88> inside the Arctic ice, created by the flow of salt water, which shrinks when frozen.
But from the above-mentioned bear to the microscopic wonders inside, all of this is doomed to disappear as soon as the summer ice moves, which happens sometimes between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, it could be us.
More than 6,000 Marines laid wreaths at graves in Arlington
Lieutenant De'Angello Robinson, 19, traveled by bus for seven hours to lay a simple wreath on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the journey from Johnson Camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, it was a day in which he paid tribute to the men and women who once wore the same shoes.
“In a few months, when we get on board, it could be us,” Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If it happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me, to show me respect as I am trying to do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the Veterans' Cemetery in several departments during a Friday act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of Worcester Funeral Company in Harrington, Maine, began this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at a funeral service in Arlington.
It is now an 18-year-old tradition where Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen undertake this journey every year and stop in different cities along the way to honor the memory of members of the army and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters are not looking for a profit in this, a crown across America, which they consider in other states as well.
This year, volunteers laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, the Pentagon, the graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and the memorial site of Flight 93 United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year in a row, the Walmart Foundation is devoting more than $150,000 to the purchase and transportation of wreaths.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in honor of her late husband, a member of the armed forces.
Because her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt said it was her way of returning what the victim was doing.
It’s a small way for citizens to support our troops, she said.
It's like visiting a family grave.
Covered in warm cloth robes, the volunteers walked through the cemetery on the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers went to older graves from World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War because these are not visited as often as newer graves.
The mood was positive when the children played and held hands together as they transported the young pine to the nascent tombstones.
Each circular wreath was dark green with a small red arc of bees on the top.
Near <0xC2><0xA7> 60, where most of the veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there was indeed silence.
The United Service Organizations dedicated 1,000 wreaths to the decoration of the department, but the gloomy mood of the ongoing wars filled this area.
Some cried sincerely, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the cold air.
Some read aloud the names carved into the stones, while others bent down to look at the small black-and-white nouns pressed into the wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from her eyes in front of her son’s grave.
She traveled eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the site of the last resting place of Sgt. David Shane Spicer, who fell in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we were free. . . . my son paid for it, she said.
"Even though I've been gone a long time, I want to be the one to remember him."
U.S. Government Contractor Imprisoned by Cuban Government Officials
The Cuban government has jailed a U.S. government contractor who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, foreign ministry officials said on Saturday.
The supplier, who has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Interest Section in Havana, sought access to the detainee, who was imprisoned on December 5.
Certain allegations have not been made public, but under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything that is labeled “dangerous.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical stances, pose a risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sanchez, which often writes about how she and her husband are being watched and harassed by government agents.
Ms S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez has repeatedly asked for permission to leave the country in order to take over the prizes, but the permission has been denied.
The U.S. supplier’s detention may be the result of growing tensions between the communist Castro brother, ruling Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been seen as a “retention tactic” in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report the New York Times' detention on Friday night.
The new U.S. policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more room for opposition, the United States will take reciprocal steps.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought after commodities in a country where the average civil servant’s salary is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones just this year; these are mostly used for text messaging because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than a one-day salary.
Internet usage on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and at some government connections, such as universities.
Cubans, who often want to sign up, must announce their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
Detaining an American in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in prison in Cuba are behind bars for heinous acts, such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, a press officer with the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Ms Berbenov<0xC3><0xA1> said she could not provide more information about the prison.
The arrests and detentions were clearly amoral.
Such activities, which would be legal in any other open society - let's call it free mobile phones - are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. human rights group, which recently published an unfavourable report on the freedoms in Cuba, called "The New Castro's Castro, a coup d'etat."
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, tried and jailed in one day.
He said that any solution would be more political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just as the two countries are heading for a broader dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are uncovering a plot to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday revealed an alleged leader of a conspiracy involving the sending of five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops there, and said they hoped the case could help uncover an extensive network of Internet recruiters and young men who have been recruited by terrorists.
Investigators said they were searching for a grey rebel figure known as Saifullah, who invited these men to Pakistan after he first discovered them when one of these men posted a comment authorizing the terrorist attacks on YouTube.
Saifillah took the leadership of these men as soon as they came to Pakistan, tried to help them get to a remote area of Pakistan in Pakistan’s indigenous tribal belt, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who reported the case said on Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in convicting al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of the CIA's attempt to infiltrate the terrorist network.
As a result, they were suspended for several days in the eastern district of Sarghoda, far from the menacing mountains of the northwest, which became a refuge for terrorists.
They were considered a striking unit.
The reason why they were suspended was stated by the official, who spoke about maintaining anonymity due to the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to gain permission to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested for carrying out Pakistani law.
The case of the five - who remained in Pakistan and was questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and perhaps, more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S. intelligence service has assigned the highest priority to attempts to place human resources in al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, excluding those who are not serious enough in their commitment to holy war and those who might be scouts.
U.S. fake recruits have been subjected to a special investigation by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to U.S. goals and their promotional value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terrorist groups have also become significantly more cautious in recent years about how they will allow Koi to access them because U.S. intelligence agencies have recruited experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to follow their recruitment model, which has already been followed so much? said Mr Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is much more web-based.
Tens of thousands protested in Copenhagen, demanding climate 'action'
Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets on Saturday and demanded more climate action from negotiators at the city’s Bella Convention Center.
Protesters reported the number of hundreds of thousands of people attending the event, but police said the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively quiet and a handful of masked activists laid several small loads near a group of government buildings in the city centre.
On the day of the small-scale UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city carrying banners reading "This is not Planet B" (i.e., second-order) and one in Spanish proclaiming "The Earth says 'enough'."
Several celebrities took part in the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she traveled to her mother’s birthplace in Peru and provided me with information about the plight of the country, which is affected by climate change, which is still happening.
That is part of the reason why we decided to join this great march -- to go around the world and appeal to the world's leading figures to come forward with a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is not an easy task, but it is necessary to carry it out, it can still be avoided.
Police prevented protesters from approaching Bella’s centre and said they had detained 19 people, primarily because they had either put on masks or had pocket knives with them.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the uninvolved viewers, who does not want to be identified because he is involved in climate talks, activists disguised as athletes and dressed in black have laid several charges near the Copenhagen main channel, which is located near several ministries.
They were agitating at buildings, he said, starting with lightbulbs, but then followed by "several large explosions."
Inside the convention center, people gathered around the television screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Wei, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked if the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English "actually, that's something that I was not aware of" (it's really something I don't realize).
Then he continued in Chinese and said, "Because the scene is vast, I can't hear what's going on outside."
He watched to see if the march was painful or helpful depending on everyone’s prospects.
It is visible the concentration of the general public and various sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that it is a violation of the conduct or freedom of other persons.
The data of the test revealed persistent racial differences.
Last week's federal certificate of achievement in mathematics was a welcome element of good news regarding Columbia County public education.
Although the district is far behind the country’s high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress among fourth- and eighth-grade students over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest figures from the National Attestation Center for Teaching Progress are the lingering differences in the knowledge gained between African Americans and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth graders in Columbia County over the past two years has risen from 267 to 270 points (out of a possible 500), but their African-American peers have seen growth of only three points, from 209 to 212.
Indeed, the knowledge gap has increased from 53 to 57 points between 2007 and 2009.
Progress among African-Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a deviation of statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average result in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over the six-year horizon is not exactly encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was conducted in the district, was 60 scale points (262 to 202).
Although the result achieved in children from oboi groups improved during this period, the difference was hardly closer to 58.
Some education advocates in the district have said in the past week that the results, celebrated by the mystery Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D), were more widely stimulated in white students where the results were already high.
This would suggest that we have increased the overall support of those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and worrying, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for equal pay for education in the district.
“I’m not jumping up and down for two or three points,” said D.C. committee member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in fourth grade at Eaton Elementary School.
Often criticizing Mrs. Rhee’s management style, Ms. Brown said that reporting the test results meant high school in the city was in a desperate state and required attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the stakes, and I respect that.
But what’s scary is that we didn’t devote almost any time and energy to our high school.
Ms Rhee said the district’s effort is to continue to look for better ways to address the needs of students with low scores.
Thus, for example, some teachers trained in the use of new curriculums are read, Wilson's reading system, aimed at upper-class elementary school students and high school students who failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their cycling careers are significantly lagging behind their peers.
Daily math and math curriculum into sixth grade, highlighting the games and real-life experiences that got into the district under former director Clifford Janeyi, can be credited to the pinnacle of NAEP’s progress, which was reported last week.
And I think that we should continue to work and make the best possible interventions for those students who remain below class level, said Mrs Rhee.
Others said the NAEP results clarified the question of whether Ms Rhee could continue to improve the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and funds for low-performance schools, which is necessary to narrow the gap.
It’s a particular dilemma for Mrs. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California, Berkeley, where he studies test results in urban areas.
The conventional procedure of correction is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
Thus, the focus can bring political echoes that are directed against an important agenda.
But the excuse belongs to other city directors, who are trying to keep the average ratio between whites and blacks.
We need to focus on building a big school system.
We need to harness the kinship of our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can rely on their children to be provided with excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now the principal of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that the basic element of reducing the gap between the achieved results is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to realize the entitlement of schools.
You need to get up to 200 days to push for change, said Mr. Janey, who signed a contract with his teachers’ association last year for a 185-day school year, which he sees as a “symptom” for seeking a bigger raise next year.
Making higher education a part of a better future
The tour bus entered the Gettysburg Railway with a loud sigh.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped out and rested for a moment on white columns, brick facades and emerald green lawns.
Gracielini's parents had a hard time graduating from high school in El Salvador.
Until now, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, never entered the ground of the railroad.
Now she and the other eighth graders in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $38690 a year, their standing was more than intimidated by visitors excited by potential students.
Yes! That's it! she called Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when he offered them a guide to enter the building of knowledge.
Wow, really? she said thoughtfully when they revealed to them the low ratio of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania Railroad was one of seven that they visited on their three-day tour and were now completely interested in the future message: The question is not whether you will enter the railroad.
The question is from where.
However, this is a significant problem concerning the high number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who are expelled from high schools or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive further education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, one-fifth of this “long generation” of Spanish college students – remarkable achievements indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central American residents, arrived in the United States without completing college.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, because it underscores their point of way forward for a generation that played a marginal role in the country’s workforce.
Those who have achieved higher education say that they had a natural inclination to go to school and an innate penetratingness and striving to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and looked for ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and the millions of children who would like to graduate college — especially if these efforts persist over time.
If we consider that children come from low-income groups whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them navigate the system, any simple intervention at each point will not solve it, says Patricia G<0xC3><0xA1>ndara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, where she studied.
We need to think about providing these children with a catchy network in preschool age in all ways to get through college.
The federal program that funded Graciely's rail trip is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to run successive preparatory programs that begin for students from low-income groups in high schools and continue until these students graduate from college.
Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, more than 1% of whom entered college, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraq’s Ministry of Petroleum Industry Reaches Agreement with 10 Foreign Oil Companies
Despite fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government has managed to get major oil companies to rebuild their untapped infrastructure during two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been signed by Iraq’s oil ministry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are poised to play a significant role in rebuilding Iraq’s oil industry, crippled by decades of wars and sanctions.
U.S. companies have gone to two of the 10 auctioned fields with a capital stake.
Seven U.S. companies paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
Only one of them made a missed offer.
The two U.S. companies reached an agreement on the field, which was auctioned in June.
The modest participation of U.S. oil giants in Iraq’s open oil industry has surprised analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American companies, you are primarily on the path of Asians and Europeans, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet.
It will be a long time before anything else is for sale in Iraq.
Security concerns highlighted by Tuesday’s massive coordinated bombings and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military, are likely to deter U.S. companies from doing much more intensive business in Iraq, which has demonstrably the third-largest reserves of raw materials, analysts say.
U.S. companies have been at a disadvantage in some cases, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy companies have significantly lower operating costs and are more susceptible to risk because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to enter into agreements with the ministry.
Leading U.S. companies, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have maintained close contacts with Iraq’s oil ministry and offered technical assistance in recent years, have left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top shareholders in two of the contracts that were awarded at the end of this week.
The state-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. participated in bids for more contracts than all other companies and left with large stakes in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic as well as technological force, said oil ministry spokesman Assam Jihad.
We are convinced that Chinese society will be comparable to the competition and will live up to its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were pre-selected for submission of tenders, which were then compared by the Ministry according to the price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening the output above the current level in each field.
The top al-Qaeda planner was apparently killed in Pakistan.
A U.S. missile strike near the Pakistan-Afghan border this week appears to have killed a top al-Qaeda operations planner, U.S. counter-terrorism officials said on Friday.
As confirmed, it could be the second deadly attack on one of the top terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when several rockets hit their car near the town of Miran Sah in North Waziristan province on Thursday, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired from an unmanned aircraft of the type used by the CIA in a band of illegal indigenous tribes.
They were pointed at a white car that was heading to the Afghan border when it was hit, the official said, along with a Pakistani civilian intelligence agency that was calling from Miran Shah.
The official said local gunmen had reached the point and quickly seized what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identities of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials cited an unspecified witness who said Somalia was dead.
Somalia has been cited as a high-ranking al-Qaeda military operations planner who led operations of terrorist groups outside Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in a worldwide resurgence, said a senior official, who does not wish to be named, who cited the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes on Pakistani territory.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from al-Qaida’s top leadership and planned possible terrorist attacks based on them.
Another U.S. official said Somalia was advancing rapidly in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well-connected to other extremist groups in the region.
He may not have been a well-known person to some Americans, but he did not humiliate himself in any way in order to pose before us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, Somalia should be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaida or the Taliban to be killed since September, when Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the indigenous tribal zone and three other top operatives were killed in a similar attack.
The rate of attacks launched by the CIA using drones has dropped from an average of about six operations a month to two since the summer, according to the Long War newspaper, a website run by a nonprofit group.
The reduction may have a reason for the improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also ruthlessly killing people they suspected were informants, the website said.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has resigned in Kabul.
The U.N.’s top envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday he would like to step down from his post in March and end a tumultuous term that has been marred by accusations of widespread corruption in the election of a U.N.-backed president in Afghanistan.
Eide's departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. delegate said he supported the increase but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for a reduction, which begins in 18 months, should be a challenge for the governments of other NATO states to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the build-up of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian staff assisting in Afghanistan’s political transformation.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of civilians, he said.
Eide said he did not resign, but simply kept the promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he would spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it's high time to look after the successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban began to seek compensation.
Officials said the decision was made between Staffan di Mistura, who is of Swedish-Italian origin and previously led the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guéhenn, a Frenchman who had previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's status in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was indicted in September by President Hamid Karzai, who won the country's presidential election by masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied these claims, but said that Galgraith's accusation -- which was released -- "certainly damaged the mission because there was a high degree of scepticism about international intervention" in the election.
Eide said he had proposed a meeting with the country's highest civilian representative to coordinate efforts to ease tensions with U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow its successors to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to lend them to the Afghan mission, so he said he wanted to build their confidence that their money was being used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment at the limited efforts he has made in Afghanistan and said that the cumbersome UN hiring regulations are undermining her ability to make the most of her abilities.
The UN rules are such that I have had the opportunity to get only one person since May, he said.
It's a disaster and I can't go on.
Gates: Iran faces further sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose “further significant sanctions” on Iran over a lack of engagement in talks on its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to areas where war is raging in Afghanistan and Iraq, downplayed the prospects of armed action against the Islamic Republic.
That’s not a good choice for Iran, he said in response to a soldier’s question about a likely development.
One of the things that depends on me is whether or not I have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, [that] is an inescapable inevitability in the war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could hit Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of those sanctions could also hit ordinary Iranians.
He said a "package of incentives and restraints" would require "to make the Iranian government really feel less safe with nuclear weapons" because "its citizens will suffer extremely" with sanctions.
According to Friday's opinion issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has engaged the European leader in warning that Iran will bear serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the UN's Nuclear Security Committee and its supervisory authority, the International Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on limiting his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial part of his stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has advocated such an agreement as a way to build trust between the two sides and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, it seems, Iran has deviated from the interim agreements — partly because, the expert says, because the Iranian leadership is divided in its views on whether to engage with the United States.
To be honest, as far as Iran's stubbornness towards the international community is concerned, in the case of some of the proposals that it actually agreed to in early October, I think it has brought the international community, including the Russians and Chinese together, on a path that is not about the terminology of the supplementary gypsies.
President Obama set a deadline for Iran on Dec. 31 to respond to proposals before returning to seek other elections, including monitoring, what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “degrading sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "unsubstantiated and unsubstantiated allegations" before some members of the security committee about Iran's nuclear activities and said it wanted to continue talks with the United States and the other five countries.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet with soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish leaders in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and Iraq's Arab majority persist, particularly over borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to avoid delaying U.S. plans to limit the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
Gates also sought to quell Kurdish concerns over the ongoing depression. US officials quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barz<0xC3><0xA1>ani, the president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: “We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We don't want to leave you."
In an ageing China, exchange rate change
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters reading that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One extra child means one extra grave".
Then they were taught that when the official government places in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We have always given all our time and energy to just one child.
We left nothing for others, says Wang, 31, a human resources manager who has an 8-month-old son.
For more than 30 years, China’s policy of having only one child has been in place, creating two generations of only notoriously bubbling and flattering children, affectionately dubbed the “little emperors,” threatening the country’s population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple compared to six before the policy entered into force, according to UN data.
The division of the population, where the number of inhabitants aged 60 and over is predicted to grow tempestuously from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050. This is far above the overall average of about 20 percent.
The imbalance is greater rich coastal cities with a population with higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over made up almost 22 percent of Shanghai’s registered population, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission on Population and Family Planning, said many couples must have children to “help reduce the proportion of the aging population and reduce the number of workforces in the future.”
He says it's about "being old, it doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Gradual reassurance
As it was inserted into the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is probably the most controversial mandate ever introduced under the Communist Party’s rule.
Couples who violated politics faced immense fines -- up to three times their annual pay in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
China’s official sites have promoted policies that have helped prevent the country’s critical use of natural resources, while human rights defenders have been condemned for pushing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women with the second child to undergo abortions.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sex-selective abortions, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have gradually been more moderate in their stance on one-child policy.
In 2004, they generally allowed exceptions—including city dwellers, members of national minorities, and cases where men and women were the only ones—and in 2007, they eased the dictation of their slogans pushing the hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at Beijing University’s Population Research Institute, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner was an only child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters urging parents to have only one child were replaced by copies of the ordinance detailing how it would be legal to have a second child and how to apply for a permit.
The city administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and insert leaflets under the door.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice to those who decided to have more than one child.
The response was cold, family planning officials said.
Annoying response
Although officials in a rural city near Shanghai have seen an increase in interest among couples who would like to have a second child after the start of the campaign, most city districts have not reported changes.
The city district of Huinan with a population of 115,000, for example, still registered four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of people born in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai’s Caolu district, said financial considerations were probably the main reason people didn’t want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said she would like to have two children and was legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, who only have inadequate health and life insurance, provided by the government.
Without a docile catch net, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West view one-child policy as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in her seventh month of pregnancy in a relationship with her first child.
Yes, we were denied the chance to have more than one child.
The problem is not only in politics.
It's about money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, the human resources manager, says they only want one child, because she was also the only one: “We were the center of attention of our families and everyone took care of us.
We weren’t used to providing care, and in fact we didn’t want to take care of the other.
Chen Zijian, 42, who owns a translation company, said it much more bluntly.
For two-career middle-class parents who have reduced birth rates, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today’s 20- and 30-year-olds view parents as the opening days of the Czech experiment with capitalism, and they don’t want this way of nurturing for themselves, he says.
It is one child who places enormous demands on the time of parents, he says.
The mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the controversial questions of propstor -- "You must rebuild your apartment" -- and strategy -- "You must have summaries prepared at a time when the child is 9 months old for a good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to settle for one child, Che says, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher nutritional standards, he says.
We don't want to make too many sacrifices.
The United Nations has outlined a plan to reduce emissions.
The U.N.-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching undisciplined attitudes and mutual indoctrination -- again on Friday focused on releasing a document that proposes an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years with industrialized nations bearing the brunt of the brunt of the unrest.
The text, which can provide a basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of greenhouse gases, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as illuminates the way forward.
But there has been important progress in negotiations that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders arriving in Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN ad hoc working group, this text inconspicuously states how much money rich countries should provide to the poor to deal with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a full range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies to limit their carbon output and what the upper limit of global temperature increases should be that policymakers will still be able to tolerate.
This provides the process with a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, chief executive of the Washington-based Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, summarized the 180-page text of the meeting to focus on what the top UN climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as a “big picture.”
It outlines the outlines for a possible agreement in which industrial nations could jointly reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent per year compared to 1990 levels, while major developing countries could reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent during this period.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions by between 50 and 95 percent by 2050.
The European Union negotiated an early pledge on Friday to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change -- from managing floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
But Friday still cited the same type of verbal fireworks that prevailed in last week’s interviews.
U.S. special envoy for climate issues Todd Stern has rejected a speech calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emissions limits for industrial countries compared to the voluntary ones for major developing economies if they were not funded by the developed world.
The move signaled that the Obama administration had drawn a harder line against China than Bush administration officials just two years ago.
The United States will not accede to the treaty without the transfer of major developing countries and the implementation of actions, Stern said, who also complained that the text was not enough to secure restrictions and should be reviewed by external observers.
Stern made the comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister He Yafei told the U.S. climate chief negotiator that either a lack of "rural reason" or "extraordinary irresponsibility" had led him to announce earlier in the week that the United States would not be able to help him financially.
With the future of the economic trajectory of the world’s major powers at stake, tensions have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies.
The current fight is mostly about the preservation of individual economies rather than the preservation of the planet, between China and the United States for the fulfillment of their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that two dozen of the world’s most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative for more vigorous action.
Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it was not surprising that major powers were fighting over who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, while vulnerable countries became much more aggressive in finding ways to prevent large emitters from acting responsibly.
It’s clearly a game about the new economic hegemony developing, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional climate change advisor to Mexico and Central America for international nature conservation.
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to promote a legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the main participants have said that the best outcome of the talks will be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, created a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led the international climate negotiations in favour of the European Commission, said that the push by small island nations "triggered a political silence on the whole polarizing process" in part because they are now unified and demand action from growing economies such as China and India.
The talks triggered a new urgency once delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the remaining issues before the heads of government fight for an agreement.
High-ranking officials such as India’s Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh and China’s Deputy Minister stepped out of planes and ran through the halls of the Bella Centre to the closed doors of meetings and new conferences so they could set the demands to be assessed next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering — when 13,000 people were moving from and to the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists staged an ironic look at the countries they thought they had sent them in the night, and there was a hand-in-hand hand-to-paper transmission of the proposals.
Intensity is only a superstructure: in Copenhagen were present almost all the key ministers and earlier on Wednesday 60 heads of state.
We have reached the high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, said the deputy minister for global policy in the international protection of nature.
Heavy weights are coming.
British first train at 140 miles per hour redefined this Monday's feeling
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, the whistle cut through the darkness at the sign of the departure of the train, which marked the transport revolution in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach a speed of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford, Kent to London’s St Pancras and exceed a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and entered the first high-speed passenger train outside London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of Midland, the north and Scotland with London.
The neglected standing water should reduce transport times in passenger and commercial transport and the transition from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on the roads.
Theoretically, the three main political parties were given the opportunity to obtain this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable fight for projects and concerns about environmental damage have now slowed the construction of Britain’s high-speed rail.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasible study, delivered its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, according to the Times.
It provided him with a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
A new route linking London to the West Midland has been designed up to five metres in urban areas and neighbourhoods where the impact on the environment could be problematic.
In the open countryside, a final route of up to 25 m was planned.
HS2 also envisages identifying three options for an extensive high-speed network leading to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond in the spring.
The preferred option is to confiscate the shape of the letter Y, where one high-speed line should lead to the West Midland.
The route should be divided near Birmingham with one branch passing from the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and the other leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One route should lead to Scotland.
"It looks like the most powerful choice has been made," he said, and a railway expert.
As soon as this is done, the journey time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first stage, which will not open before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than one hour in the presence.
The proposals should allow trains to run at a speed of 2250 miles per hour, which would make the UK network the fastest in Europe.
The initial route is already being proposed to take trains of 400 m in length, which would be able to carry 1100 people.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
In view of the capital constraints, it is assumed that the existing station would expand to include a high-speed network.
Railway industry experts claim that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such a potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he intends or does not intend to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultation and planning procedures mean that the final decision will not be made before the general election.
Even if it sets the wheels in motion, the network should be built in parts.
Trains should first be put into service, not on high-speed lines, but on existing lines north of Birmingham, and keep the journey times between London and Scotland above three hours.
This is considered to be the decisive point of contact for ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, the point of reference for the railway revolution.
Taxpayers paid a <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 mortgage on Tory orangery
Alan Duncan, the holder of the Tory front bench in the House of Representatives, paid taxpayers thousands of pounds in expenses last year for the orangery he built in his home in the constituency.
A spokesman for the prison party, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living “out of allotments,” raised his mortgage to <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 to build an oak-lined extension at his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims in a timely manner and so he was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legge, who carried out the control of member spending. Last night Mr Duncan made his demands "it could have been cleaner or simpler".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of parliament, owns two two-storey houses in his Rutland and Melton constituencies.
The houses are worth about a million pounds.
On the ground floor there is a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the finance office agreed that Mr. Duncan needs more space.
Last year he added to the house a winter garden, which is in the plans labeled as "orangery".
Neighbors described it as a "greenhouse for entertainment and hospitality".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation for the increased loan during the last inspection by the Committee on Municipal Standards and Privileges in the final settlement of the mortgage.
The committee told him last month that he had broken the rules after reviewing his spending.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed the <0xC2><0xA3>27,1406 mortgage on his London property to a house in his constituency, which he bought in 1991, a year before he became a member of the House of Representatives.
Documents released this week showed Mr. Duncan was claiming about <0xC2><0xA3>1,400 a month for a mortgage until March last year.
In April, his entitlements increased to more than <0xC2><0xA3>1,800 a month.
Interest in Mr. Duncan’s RBS mortgage repayments could not have changed at this time, suggesting that all of this was intended to finance a <0xC2><0xA3>75,000 loan.
The standard variable RBS mortgage repayments fell from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year, while remaining.
The latest document from the municipal authorities shows that Mr Duncan continued to claim <0xC2><0xA3>1,250 a month in May this year.
Mr. Duncan left his job as shadow leader of the House in September after being filmed by a secret reporter and told that MPs must survive the spending scandal.
"Basically it's nationalized, you have to live on allocation and it treats you like shit."
He said, “I lost money for my garden and entitlement and a small fraction of what was needed.
And I could claim the whole damn share, but I won't."
The MP, a millionaire from a former oil trader career, was first asked to explain his spending in May when it turned out that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before the financial authority approved that it "could be considered excessive".
One of the activists dug a pound-shaped pit in Mr. Duncan’s lawn for protest after it was revealed that he had claimed <0xC2><0xA3>4,000 for three years.
When asked last night about raising the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said, “It was because of the capital increase, which was approved by both the Financial Authority and subsequently Legge.”
He added: “It’s not a controversial issue of hiding and clicking or breaking the rules or anything else.
It's absolutely straight line down, by the rules, justified and that's all.
It would not be possible in many other ways to be cleaner or simpler.”
Come and take a look at the cottage on the Brighton coast with an advent calendar.
Brighton’s coastal cottages have found a new meaning of life in the winter months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages the ducal use of creativity has called on 24 owners to decorate their cottages for every day in December, and to use Christmas colts as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on December 1st, when visitors were able to view the last chat room from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and the bishop’s bread and toasted wine, provided free of charge.
The selected collages included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First No<0xC3><0xAB>l, where the cottage featured the work of Janet Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, a 50-year-old television marketing assistant from Hove, is a priest without a scholarship in the Diocese of Chichester and head of Beyond.
He said: “We want to make religion much more important for people in post-Christian society.
"Why should we as a church expect people to come to a foreign old building? I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an awakening way.
“The idea of an Advent calendar in cottages came about just as a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we have tried to try and present it in a spiritual way.”
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and in the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, was demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, the aim of which is to adopt an agreement that could enter into force on Friday, January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said that the growing global mobilization, the clear evidence of which is the current demonstrations, had contributed to the fact that the “political tax” of eventual failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
According to the AFP journalist, there were incidents in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the parade, when a group of about 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, began to smash the displays with tiles and hammers.
The police immediately intervened with great force.
In total, the police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical separate groups, which were already manifested in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the action, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without distinction" and stressed that about a hundred of them were in handcuffs and in the seat "held in the streets still on Saturday evening" despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the procession quietly headed for the Bella Center, where the talks were taking place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate inside.
A podium was built for the speakers, in front of which a spiritual meeting took place at the candles with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters came by bus and train from major European cities and, in addition to Africans, there were a large number of participants from Asia, including several Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue robes, formed the first meeting in Copenhagen in the morning at the invitation of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create “blue waves” for a “fair climate”.
“Today we are going to the streets to demand a settlement of the ecological debt in favor of the South,” said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can no longer say: this is the time, said the Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
Rivers and streams are drying up in Africa, and we can walk in them today, and it has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the movement of struggle for another world has approached ecological organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the figures fighting for a different world, said he came to Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice". "Currently, there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world ".
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people marched, mostly students, in red clothes and scarves evocative of the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong, Jakarta, but also in Canada, several hundred demonstrators took to the streets demanding urgent action against climate change.
In France, protests organized by the "350" movement were attended by hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
There were dozens of people in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia condemns it as a "flipper"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, about a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent of Georgia, Tbilisi, on the contrary, declares this step a “flask”.
Some 131,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Georgian War in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhaz Election Commission, the turnout was 58% a few hours before the closing of the polling stations.
The first preliminary results should be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
All five candidates, including incumbent President Sergey Bagapsh, categorically reject the idea of a merger with Georgia, which condemned the election.
This election is a scam.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen into Russian domination," his spokesman, Manana Manjgaladze, said.
Apart from Russia, they recognized the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants only Nicaragua and Venezuela, while the rest of the world considers it part of Georgia, which was illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After separation from Georgia, after the 1992-1993 conflict that killed several thousand people, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era of our independent state, said Kvar<0xC4><0x8D>ija Sv<0xC4><0x9B>tlanov<0xC3><0xA1>, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Bagap<0xC5><0xA1>.
She was one of those who came to vote in an election room at a school in the capital city of Suchumi, a beautiful white building with several palm trees at the entrance.
The issue of Russian domination is the main topic of the presidential elections in this region on the Black Sea coast, which can boast of beautiful nature.
Across this small country of 216,000 people, huge billboards with Bagapsh are placed next to Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the west of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the successful course of the elections were warmly welcomed by the district mayor Beslan Arshba.
"We, the Abkhaz, are grateful," he said at a small ceremony, referring to Moscow's support and, in particular, its decision to recognize Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, said Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, and drank a glass of vodka on it.
The opposition, which was represented in the election by former vice-president Raul Khadzhimba and two traders Zause Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized the agreements concluded last year with Moscow, such as the agreement that allows Russia to control the Abacha 10 rail network.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive battle must take place within two weeks.
Climate: events in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday demanding a strong and binding agreement to combat global warming, which should be adopted at a conference in Copenhagen, was demonstrated around the world and in Copenhagen, where about 700 people were arrested by police on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated this afternoon in cold weather in the Danish capital, which hosts delegates from 193 countries until 18 December, discussing an agreement that could enter into force on 1 January 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the procession quietly headed for the Bella Center, where the talks were taking place.
Demonstrators stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate inside.
A podium was built for the speakers, in front of which a spiritual meeting took place at the candles with the participation of the former South African Archbishop of Cape Town Desmond Tutu.
According to the AFP journalist, there were incidents shortly after the departure of the parade, when a group of several hundred demonstrators, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hammers, began to break the windows.
The regular police immediately surrounded them and attacked them without waiting, while several protesters fell to the ground.
In total, the police announced the arrests of 600 to 700 people and specified that they were mainly members of the "Blacks Blocks", ultra-radical separate groups, which appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, eastern France.
In the late afternoon, a policeman on the jaw was injured by a tile cube and four cars were set on fire near a squad located near the incidents, which resulted in the arrest of about 20 people, according to police sources.
We are focusing on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned, as police helicopters flew into the air again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam and Milan, were of European origin.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue robes, formed the first meeting in the morning in Copenhagen at the invitation of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create “blue waves” for a “fair climate”.

French MEP José Bové, one of the figures fighting for a different world, said he came to Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice". "Currently, there is no difference between the fight against global warming and the fight for another world ".
Oxfam has invited several celebrities, including Danish model Helena Christensen and former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where there are many islands particularly sensitive to climate warming.
In Australia, according to organizers, about 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people demonstrated in front of the city hall of the capital of the Philippines, mostly students in red clothes and with scarves evoking the importance of solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, several hundred demonstrators also called for strong action against climate change.
In France, protests organized by the "350" movement were attended by hundreds of people, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).

The subjects of geography and history will be strengthened as part of the reform of the General Gymnasium, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said during an interview with JDD magazine on Sunday that subjects of history and geography would be "strengthened" as part of the General Gymnasium reform, although their teaching would no longer be mandatory in the final year of the gymnasium with a focus on the exact sciences.
Now all students of the second year will have four hours a week and for all there will be the same program of general culture, confirmed Chatel.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to end hypocrisy" because, according to him, the specialization S is no longer focused on the exact sciences" but "in fact, the best students are in it".
The specialization of EC and L can not be for S some sub-specializations, continues and emphasizes: "I have not heard many historians and intellectuals who would find it difficult not to learn geography and history in the last year of professional gymnasiums".
A survey by Ifop, published on Saturday by the journal Humanité, showed that seven out of ten French people (69%) disagreed with the government’s plan to abolish compulsory teaching of history and geography in the high school year with a specialization of S, and therefore many right-wing intellectuals and teachers alike.
On the contrary, the Minister added that "it does not come into consideration" to abolish philosophy in the program of specialization with a graduation year.
At the same time, Luc Chatel defended the reform in teacher education, while 16 organizations (students and unions) called for participation in Tuesday's mobilization against this project, which according to them sacrifices the pedagogical education of future professors of gymnasiums.
As part of Master’s degree 2 (M2), at the beginning of the year, they will take an entrance exam focused on their field and at the end of the year an additional exam verifying their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will participate in professional internships during the second year of the Master’s degree and in the first year they will perform as a professor-trainee in front of the students.
If you list all the internships that will be offered to you prior to admission, you will gain more experience with students, almost 300 hours, continued .
The minister also announced that he would propose a "personal right to education", which does not yet exist in national education.
He reaffirmed the project to abolish the school map by 2012.
At the elite <0xC3><0x89>cole normale supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to the presentation of the goals of the Copenhagen summit: this is the call announced in the morning by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IGEC) at the initiative of the University of Ecole Normale Supérieure on Ulm Street.
According to an AFP journalist, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a one-day seminar consisting of fifteen-minute contributions by experts that will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and on the basis of which they would be more willing to learn something more, explained 22-year-old Edouard Hannezo, one of the organizers of this seminar, who got the name after the fish from the local pond, which was so named by the students.
About twenty contributing experts from different scientific disciplines will be selected, and it has been clarified that the choice is based on their charisma.
“We can talk for hours, but we can also summarize the basic goals in a few minutes,” said Jean Jouzel, who spoke to fifty listeners without pre-prepared notes, using graphs alone.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that listeners will learn that "the Copenhagen conference is based on a very seriously prepared scientific basis".
Videos of these lectures will be posted on the school’s website from December 15.
The next seminar "Ernest" is scheduled for February and others will follow with regularity every two months.
Delays in payments: angry guards in prisons, planned measures
Prison guards' unions announced on Friday "general mobilization" as they demand that they be paid bonuses and overtime for Christmas holidays, the payment of which was postponed to January for financial reasons.
The prison FO (2nd Guards Division) has asked employees who will not be on duty to attend a demonstration held in front of the prison facilities on Tuesday morning, and to "block" them, thus alerting them to the "theft of their wages".
The CGT for Prison Supervisors (3rd Departments of this sector) has called for “convening meetings in individual prisons and initiating a fundamental mobilization” with the view that it is “disgusting and unacceptable” to “overtime and surcharges for work at night, on Sundays and on holidays” not to be observed from the beginning of the week.
The first watchdog unions, the Federal Union of Prison Wardens (Ufap/Unsa), "calls for a general mobilization (...) in order to show discontent and indignation".
The Directorate-General and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime has increased considerably in 2009 and not all of them have been included in the financial budget, but they ensure that the amounts due will be paid in January.
The Chancellery said at the end of the day that Mich<0xC3><0xA8>le Alliot-Mari had sent a message to the prison guards’ unions in which she assured them that the payment would be made next month.
I am aware of the efforts that prison staff are making to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system,” the minister said in a statement.
I have ordered the Directorate-General of Prisons to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation, which has arisen due to the wrong assessment of the number of overtimes, never repeats itself in the future, Minister Alliot-Mariov<0xC3><0xA1> added.
The December salary will therefore be low, with the exception of managers who receive famous bonuses for performing functions and fulfilling goals, Ufap/Unsa says, and for those "there is always a place in the budget".
It is simply a scandal, outraged by the interregional FO union in Marseille and announced its decision to boycott the recall of "all meetings and summonses".
Workers will not come to work on Sundays or holidays if they are not paid the surcharges for these days of October in December, as well as for overtime, the FO Rh<0xC3><0xB4>ne-Alpes-Auvergne is also at risk.
At a time when they are giving us more and more work and more tasks without giving us more staff, it is sad to allow the lowest-ranking staff to pay for it, says the CGT prison guards in Bordeaux.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some of which are better than others.
However, in any case, financial means are scarce, stated the Secretary General of Ufap, Jean-Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Forget.
Obama Says He Gives ‘Better Gifts’ Than Those He Gets at Christmas
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, has confided to Oprah Winfrey's "goddess" screen that when it comes to gifts, he has a simple rule: "I give better gifts than the ones I get."
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special issue of the show, which will air on Sunday night on ABC about how they are going to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, a small four-legged companion of the family, gets his share.
"Jesus likes Boa too," Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog would also "of course" receive a gift, as evidenced by excerpts from the show's pre-broadcast.
And Michelle Obama also opposed her husband’s claim about the quality of the gifts he receives: “No, I certainly didn’t, I gave you the fine gifts last year,” she teased the president.
Well, that's true, of course, he was forced to agree to the president, but immediately afterwards he pointed with humor at the pearl necklace of the first lady: "And who gave you this?".
During this one-hour, very relaxed show with the famous hostess who worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the couple also spoke to Obama about their most unpopular gifts they had received as children.
Barack Obama introduced a 10-speed transmission, but also a basketball, which was dedicated to him at Christmas by his Kenyan father, whom he met very rarely.
“I remember seeing my father come to see us at Christmas and he gave me that basketball,” the president said.
A long time later, I realized that the ball was actually given to me by him.
The first lady again remembered the dollhouse.
I didn’t know how to arrange everything in the house, so I leveled all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around the fireplace, but I loved that little dollhouse, Michelle Obama remembered.
Johnny Hallyday Re-Operated, RTL Says He's in Artificial Sleep
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles due to "injuries" following a major operation he underwent in France, but the situation is, according to his closest "under control", while RTL station said the singer is in artificial sleep to prevent pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated overnight from Wednesday to Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors noted an "injuries resulting from the operation" of a blackout record he had spent in Paris on November 26, a Paris-based press release said.
However, the singer's press department tried to reassure the public and said the situation was "under control" and announced that new medical communications would be issued within 48 hours at the latest.
According to the RTL station, which is the singer's main partner on the last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to prevent "pain and complications".
In 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we will have a little more certainty, adds RTL.
The press department did not confirm or comment on this information when asked by AFP.
The RTL also states that, according to "some sources", no drain was located in Paris after the first operation.
Rocker was operated on at the Parc Monceau international clinic because of a feverish gossip.
The surgery, which had been scheduled for several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a doctor well known in art circles.
However, the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on the RTL information.
After the surgery, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized Monday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles for an infection that occurred after the procedure.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallydaye, said on RTL radio on Thursday that his friend was going through a "bad period" but added that he was "not worried" about the rocker because he is a big "fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing stupid because spending 12 hours on a plane after such an operation is no joke, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, calmed the situation, saying that Johnny Hallyday "responds well to antibiotics" and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said that he had met Laeticia, the singer’s wife, and that he had not noticed any particular concerns.
The singer's health problems have only multiplied since July, when he was hospitalized for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone's surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on a "small tumor of the small intestine" and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, every single one of his health problems has been very much watched and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team again had to deny the news of a new hospitalization.
Euro-2009/small swimming pool: premiere of Bousquet in his favorite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a triple medalist at the 2009 World Championships in the big pool, won a title at the 2009 European Championships in the small pool in Istanbul on Thursday in a discipline he particularly likes: 50m freestyle.
The first day of the championship, which last allowed overalls, only three world records fell, although many more were expected.
One of them beat the Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztov<0xC3><0xA1> in the 200 m position race and the two remaining men's relay of Russia in the 4x50 m position race.
A great pity for Bousquet, who made the leap to the world record in the 50 m freestyle, which he already holds in the large pool (20,94).
In one of the two royal swimming disciplines, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, at which ten swimmers started the premiere instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatia's Duje Draganj (20.70) and Russia's Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30), as predicted.
We can always dream of something better, but I said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were wearing polyurethane jumpsuits, which will be banned from January 1st.
The overalls have helped to set 238 world records since February 2008 and their era ends in Istanbul, which first hosted them in 1999 at the same competition.
The use of the jumpsuit this time also did not help the Germans Paul Biedermann, double world champion in a large pool in the summer in Rome, who had a world record at hand.
The young swimmer failed to break the record, holding the 400-meter freestyle (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian racer Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn’t put everything into the race.
I knew I wouldn’t beat the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I did my job.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future, Biedermann explained.
Zol’s Romanesque sarcophagus was auctioned for $1.5 million
The Romanesque sarcophagus, which belonged to none other than French writer Emil Zol, was auctioned for $1.5 million on Thursday, far more than was estimated, said art dealer Sotheby's.
The price of this two-meter-long and 63-cm-high headboard, dating back to the third century AD, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
Marble "representing four Dionysian scenes in elaborate architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bakchanty is a rare work, there are very few such pieces in the world, maybe four or five," Florent Heintz, vice-president of the auction of Soyuz and Soyuz, told AFP on Tuesday.
The work was sold among a hundred others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it’s the subject matter that has attracted the most attention, Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The fact that Emile Zola bought this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The board was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgi family and then gradually appeared with the French actress Cecile Sorelova, who decorated the bath with it in her private hotel in Paris and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third Republic in France and shortly before the President of the Council.
There she remained shadowed for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz discovered while searching the Louvre museum database that the plaque was part of the "Emil Zola remains" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the frescoes "Rougon-Macquart".
Interrupted attempt to remove President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico on Thursday ruled that the conditions for the transfer of ousted Honduran President Manuel Zelaya, to whom the rebels refused to provide a guarantee of safe departure, were not met.
After the telephone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything so far indicates that there is no way to carry out this transfer, said the Mexican Minister of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinos.
A Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya flew back, a source at the Directorate-General for Migration said.
The government wanted to force President Zelaya to "demise" and to apply for political asylum abroad, only to give him the possibility of a safe exit.
But the ousted president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as the exiled head of state.
The government of the Puchis "has experienced another setback when it wanted me to resign (...), they wanted me to resign", Zelaya told Globo radio on Thursday, in which he often expresses himself to the political crisis that has been going on in this Central American country for five months.
I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here, added the ousted president, hidden at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and played a few chords.
The Mexican embassy has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transportation, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an asylum application, Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
I will not seek asylum from any country, said Manuel Zelaya in an interview with Telesur, which is based in Caracas.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as president of the Honduran people.
News of Zelaya's departure mobilized supporters of the ousted president, who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the army reinforced protection.
Brazil’s foreign minister, Celso Amorim, criticized the government’s stance.
They show their marginal attitude to international norms, he added.
Zelaya, who was close to socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was ousted on June 28, the day he organized a public consultation in preparation for his re-election, against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
He unexpectedly returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and found refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he gets out of here, he will be arrested and held responsible for the crime of the "Velezrad" he is accused of, the Pu<0xC4><0x8D>ist government claims.
President Roberto Michelet was able to hold a presidential election on November 29 to replace President Zelaya.
In the controversial elections recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street Rises, U.S. Trade Balance Boosts Optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended Thursday with an increase and the results of the U.S. trade balance show a rise in both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and Nasdaq 0.33%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10,405.83 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor 500 Index improved by 0.58% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegzo of FTN Financial.
But we can’t take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on “half a full glass.”
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are focusing primarily on U.S. trade balance numbers, “which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell 7.6% in October from September to $32.9 billion.
Analysts, on the other hand, expected an increase in the deficit.
There has been an increase in both imports and exports.
A big news is the growing volume of trade, especially exports of goods, reflecting the growth of the economies of the main trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week, unemployment rose against all expectations, and the number of job seekers reached 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has dropped to "the lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The securities market has also fallen.
Treasury yields with a 10-year outlook rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday evening, and yields for 30 flights rose to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of the regime chanted "Ladies in white"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime booed the wives of political prisoners who met in Havana on the occasion of World Human Rights Day on Thursday, and prevented another demonstration that arrested dozens of dissidents.
About forty "Lady in White", wives or close political prisoners were whipped directly on the street by supporters of the regime of Raul Castro as they marched towards the center of the capital demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist said.
Away with the Yankees!, "Soldiers!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!", the regime's supporters chanted at dissidents with their raised fists.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by members of the civilian population who had come "to ensure security".
The day before, there was a similar demonstration in Havana against the "Ladies in White", but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in Havana’s Vedado district, about 10 dissidents were detained by police in civilian detention, who were also set to demonstrate on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, the AFP reported.
According to this journalist, the police have loaded dissidents who have been whipped by supporters of the government regime into civilian vehicles using force.
Arrests of dissidents under similar conditions usually take only a few hours.
The European Parliament's 2005 Sakharov Prize winners, "Ladies in White," organized an unauthorized march for "the release of all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners," said one of their leaders, Laura Pollanov<0xC3><0xA1>, whose husband, Héctor Maceda, is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr. Maceda is one of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, of whom 53 remain behind bars.
The Cuban authorities consider opponents to be "soldiers" or "agents" paid by their main enemy, the United States.
Cuban television has reported a Thursday demonstration by supporters of the government’s regime against “refugees of the revolution.”
Cuba, with the Communist Party in the lead and one-party government policy, is regularly accused by European or American non-governmental organizations of non-respect of human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A madman stabbed to death an 80-year-old man and wounded five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A man armed with two knives killed an 80-year-old man and injured five other people in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) at peak time on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the 28-year-old attacker allegedly attacked with two knives and for unknown reasons an 80-year-old man in the pharmacy or in front of it, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
A severely injured old man, born in 1929, died at the hospital of the Alliance police syndicate as a result of his injuries.
In this pharmacy or in front of her, the assailant then assaulted a pregnant woman and her partner.
At the age of thirty, the husband began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were admitted to the same hospital where an 80-year-old man died.
The life of the other injured is in danger, according to police sources, apparently vital organs have been affected.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "in shock," a police source said.
An armed man who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled into the street, still on boulevard Jean Jaur<0xC3><0xA8>s.
He injured two other people, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old man and a 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
How this all happened is not entirely clear, for it all happened in the evening hours.
He was armed with two butcher knives, carrying a cross behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, the head of the Alliance union in Hauts-de-Seine.
Several passers-by, including young people, have tried to stop and disarm the madman, according to testimonies gathered by AFP.
I saw a 30-year-old guy in a green jacket.
Three young men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, commented on the situation Alberto, a waiter from a nearby bar.
He was thrown by a crowd, including one city policeman, who broke his wrist, he added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two city police officers, including their commander, attempted to detain an armed man and were wounded with fists, a police source said.
The incident took place in one of the main streets of Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
I've been told by passers-by that there's an injured person outside.
I went out and saw a seventy-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place, and noticed a large wound to the abdomen, Frederic Allione, a thirty-five-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, a second, about thirty-year-old came along, who also had stab wounds with a knife.
A man who did not have his identity papers with him was later arrested by the state police.
The prosecutor in Nanterre handed the case over to the investigation department of the regional police in Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was taken to the hospital on Thursday night.
He's in custody waiting for questioning.
The police source did not rule out his placement in a psychiatric hospital.
Another police source said it took six police officers to handle him at the police station in Clichy, where he was taken.
He was "outside himself" as "all madmen of this type, whose strength in action increases tenfold".
U.S.: Polanski's lawyer again asks for an end to criminal prosecution
The lawyer of Polish-French director Roman Polanski again demanded on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, west of the United States) to stop the criminal prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence due to a moral affair that occurred before.
Chad Hummel, legal counsel for the director of the film "Pianist", criticized before the three judges of the appeals court of the second district of California a serious error that occurred during the trial at the time of the events in 1977.
I demand a halt to the prosecution now and immediately, Hummel said, adding that out of the behavior of the judge who then ruled in the case, Laurence Rittenband "had a chill in his back".
According to him, the judge (who died in the meantime) allegedly had to deal with a public prosecutor before the verdict was pronounced, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to prison – a serious violation of the law.
Information about this interview appeared in the document "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, wanted and wanted), from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells finally declared by the end of September that he had " lied" to the author of the document.
In the event that the court refuses to stop the criminal proceedings, the lawyer Hummel will demand a court appearance, in which he will be able to present evidence of his claim.
The applicant reiterated what had already been said at the first State hearing, namely that there would be no serious examination of the application for a halt to the criminal proceedings until Roman Polanski was brought before the court.
The 76-year-old escaped from the United States in 1978, before the court ruled in a case of "illegal sexual intercourse" with a minor girl aged 13.
Since then, he has never re-entered the United States.
Los Angeles prosecutor Phyllis Asayam said Roman Polanski “should be there to take part in the trial.”
In this case, we want to tell not only Roman Polaski, but also other defendants that it is possible to escape?
It is the opinion that the director "requests the court favor and at the same time despises his authority."
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make a decision, also stressed that "there are other alternatives to escape".
Hummel's lawyer wasn't the only one asking for a halt to Roman Polanski's criminal prosecution.
The legal representative of the victim, Samantha Geimer, also again asked for an end to the criminal prosecution.
She recalled that her client would no longer tolerate the eternal harassment every time Polanski’s case emerged, adding: “No one in this room can say that the trial was fair.”
Thirty-two years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on Sept. 26 by U.S. orders.
After more than two months behind bars, he was released to home prison in his cottage in Gstaad, where he is waiting for a possible deportation.
Wall Street ends without direction, he is stopped by a rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended Friday without a direction, the market fluctuates between indicators that are better than expected in the US and the rising price of the dollar: the Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points and Nasdaq, with technological dominance, left 0.55 points and ended up at 2,190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1,106.41 points.
To be honest, the market is very quiet, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has been greatly reduced and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend was also confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and that "helped to improve the market mood in terms of the stability of the economic recovery," concluded the analyst Charles Schwab.
In the US, retail sales grew by 1.3% in November for the second month in a row and much more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate by the University of Michigan index, U.S. consumer confidence also returned, rising sharply to 73.4 in December from 67.4 in the previous month.
However, the indexes were hampered by a new rise in the dollar's price against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, "pushing down sectors sensitive to the economic situation," said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology stocks are losing ground under their feet.
The securities market has fallen.
The yield of the Treasury with a view to 10 years rose to 3.540% from 3.482% on Wednesday evening and with a view to 30 years increased to 4.497% from 4.492% the day before.
The election of Miss World again in South Africa.
After a monthly trip across the South African Republic, 112 candidates for the Miss World title on Saturday are set to cross the finish line to achieve their dream of being voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion TV viewers.
This great celebration of beauty took place for the second year already in the vicinity of Johannesburg and so far five candidates have gained progress to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariata Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbrataro and Yanbing Maov<0xC3><0xA1> from Canada were chosen Miss sport or Miss top model during their African stay.
It was a real whirlwind of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban or Cape Town.
"I've seen a lot of things and I've had so many experiences!" said Miss Sierra Leone.
The competition, which takes place in the Republic of South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, from 5 p.m.
I could not dream of a more beautiful country, in which I would plant a crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I’m happy that I could have experienced it twice, Miss World Ksenia Sukhin confided, in the hot southern summer.
For young Russia, her second stay in the South African Republic was carried in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and the new discovery of the country and its "breathing country".
After a month of performances, rehearsals, press meetings and safaris, Miss is now focusing on the competition itself.
India’s Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also took part in the election of Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winners who both became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned as the most beautiful woman in the world is every woman’s dream, but it’s not just about looks.
“We are ambassadors of our countries and I want to come home with a crown,” Miss India says with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th edition will take place in the spirit of music and dance.
Candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV presenter Angela Chow, former beauty queen Michelle McLean of South Africa and Miss World Committee Chair Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it is able to welcome the world with a warmth that is difficult to cope with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World pageant.
Just like last year, the candidates took part in safaris, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time by bike, and tasted the local cuisine.
An extraordinary event was the meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Unusual for the president, Miss Sierra Leone noted.
Undoubtedly the most beautiful memory will be the draw in Cape Town (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will be held in June 2010, which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could meet people I didn't even dream of.
“I’m definitely going back to the 2010 World Cup,” says Miss Italy Alice Taticchi.
According to David’s son, reports of Hallyday’s condition are “very positive.”
Reports of Johnny Hallyday's condition are "very positive" as his son David assured us on his Friday arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he flew to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The reports are very positive.
“He’s very strong and everything is going very well,” Hallyday said as he took off from a plane that arrived from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time.
The singer's calmly acting son said he would "as soon as possible" be taken to Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, where Johny Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to a post-operative infection resulting from surgery for a blunted intervertebral disc, which he underwent on November 26.
According to a press release, the night was sung in Los Angeles because of the comfort of "inserted into artificial sleep", which is intended to prevent pain and facilitate the administration of treatment.
Johnny Hallyday, a physician at Cedars-Sina<0xC3><0xAF> Hospital in Los Angeles, has already been put to artificial sleep. Hospitalization was due to an infection following the operation of a heated intervertebral disc on November 26 in Paris.
Due to serious damage caused by this intervention, the singer had to be re-operated from Wednesday to Thursday night.
According to the AFP photographer, his wife Laeticia attended a high school performance of a French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, which is attended by their daughter Jade.
Yves Catoné, head of the department of orthopaedic surgery and trauma at La Pitié-Salp<0xC3><0xAA>tri<0xC3><0xA8>re Hospital, said he was flying to Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated on the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
They told us it was a massacre.
Los Angeles surgeons said they were outraged, Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "went too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Parisian surgeon".
I spoke to the doctor personally on the phone and he assured me that this trip is not a problem, which surprised me greatly, since I myself had already suffered twice with a vertebral disc loss, he added.
A moment earlier, on RTL radio station, he said that the singer apparently flew away after the Paris operation without a drone, without anything.
Dr Stéphane Delajoux is very well known in artistic circles.
He operated on actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he worked at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove the hematoma caused by bleeding into the brain.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, convicted several times in cases of neglect of medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
Olivier Metzner, a lawyer for the Medical Chamber, described him as "a man without scruples" who is "regularly" summoned to the Medical Chamber and who cannot be "recommended" far away.
After several days of silence, Dr Stéphane Delajoux spoke about the matter on Friday through his lawyer David Koubbi.
He said the procedure had "absolutely good progress" and the post-operative examination was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic in nature, therefore it was not necessary to introduce a drain," he added.
The singer’s health problems have been increasing since this summer, and in any case, his next tour seems to remain with the question mark.
It is clear that the date of the scheduled January 8 tour renewal (in Amiens) seems too close, Camus said.
The UDF raises the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre party not to continue using their abbreviation.
The UDF, controlled by MoDemFran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou, responded on Friday to the Nouveau Centre party president Hervé Morin’s attempt to take over the former Giscard party’s acronym, saying it must not be used in any media under the threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin has publicly announced his intention to take over the UDF, saying that Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayra does not deserve to carry her legacy after giving his hand to the left.
The Defense Minister, whose party is a partner of the UMP, planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC) movement.
This move was supported by Hervé de Charetta (former vice-UMP now for NC), who attributes ownership to the UDF brand, as he was the first to have it registered with the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la proprietaire industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday evening, the UDF Association committee headed by friends of Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou, who do not intend to be expropriated, stepped out of its silence and made a formal request to the minister and MPs to stop using the abbreviation and return ownership of the trademark, under the threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have raised concerns that you are proposing to your political movement to re-take the UDF abbreviation, writes the Association in its letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, including Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the MoDem Centre or Senator Jean Arthuis.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement the name+Nouveau centre+, with the slogan +UDF na<0xC5><0xA1>ka+, the signatories of the letter also state.
As you are aware, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF Committee, which requests the NC"immediately remove all references to the UDF name from all promotional materials including (its) websites".
At the same time, he asks Hervé de Charette "to hand over the ownership of the trademark to the legitimate owners".
If you do not, we will turn to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warn.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement of 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "elected" to leave in 2007 "to create a competitive movement, as others did in 2002 to establish the UMP.
Thus, according to them, the Nouveau centre movement has no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie fran<0xC3><0xA7>aise).
At the same time, they recall that the last Congress of the UDF voted in 2007 to join MoDem for three years and to create a committee charged with defending the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, "when he registered the trademark", he was "not a member of the UDF for three years", but the UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent manner, he used the non-existent registration of the acronym to do so on his own account.
This inaccuracy begins to turn into a crime, they declare, and then ironically express themselves to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that both in politics and in ordinary life it is more valuable to make a name for yourself than to step out of anonymity by fraudulently accepting a name for which we have no right."
Liliane Bettencourt’s case: Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier will be tried for abuse of a state of weakness.
The Nanterre court on Friday decided to try artist Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise-Marie Banier and decide whether he had used the frailty of the 80-year-old billionaire to prepare her for a portion of her fortune, which his daughter Liliane Bettencourt blames him for.
The photographer (62 years old), known for his photographs of celebrities, will be sentenced on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of a state of weakness, a crime for which a penalty of up to 3 years and a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC> 375 000 is imposed.
This decision confirms that a process will indeed take place in a case that can be described as the family saga of one of the richest families in France, in which a mother and daughter fight against each other and fight for control of the L'Oréal cosmetic empire.
However, the 15th criminal court also ordered a medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt, which should be carried out by a college of three doctors.
The heir and principal shareholder of L'Oréal has always refused to undergo such an investigation, certainly not under the conditions offered by the Nanterre State Prosecutor's Office during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should prepare a report by March 10, 2010 and at the same time give an opinion on whether Liliana Bettencourt could have been in a state of weakness, and in what period.
I think he'll take it.
I will discuss the matter with her," Bettencourt's lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
With regard to the lawyer Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, the decision was welcomed by the court.
The expertise will show that with this old lady who needs protection, he manipulated (M. Banier), he confirmed.
It’s been two years since Liliana Bettencourt’s only daughter launched a criminal case against Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois-Marie Banier, a photographer and artist she blames for years of using her mother’s state of weakness to obtain a billion euros gift in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or paintings.
But Liliane Bettencourt has always denied that she would be manipulated by a photographer she considers a long-term friend.
While the court had to assess the legitimacy of the lawsuit filed by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday’s courtroom speech by lawyers changed to a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt's lawyer submitted three letters that his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to her notary, expressing her distrust of her husband Fran<0xC3><0xA7>ois Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt said, “You could explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.
Since she got married, I've never been able to talk to Fran<0xC3><0xA7>oise."
The Nanterre State Prosecutor’s Office again found that the complainant’s actions were not justified, even more so that the custodial judge in those days rejected her request to initiate proceedings to issue legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully capable of participating in court, is not under protection or guardianship.
No one else will act for her," prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney said.
The Court finally decided that Ms Bettencourt-Meyers's statement of entitlement should be made at the time of the initiation of the proceedings.
The managerial revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of large French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been futile...
For more than a decade, it has been a reminder of the behaviour of big business management towards employees, of how companies approach consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about making employees identify with the “values” determined from the mountain, as it was before, when consumers had to impose the products that came from the technology.
By making the customer the center of business companies, the marketing revolution has compared the strategy of conquering the market in the right direction... although authoritarian efforts to impose products other than customer preferences are regularly returning!
The passive approach of employees can lead to fatal demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault companies are only a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon, which mostly affects management personnel.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and more importantly, economic intelligence.
Indeed, the EI “requires from all parties involved an active approach and the ability to predict” and requires from employees commitments that are completely contrary to the revenues of authoritarian management.
That is why we are calling for a management revolution, which should aim to bring employees into the center of interest of the company as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal surveys of public opinion.
Will internal surveys of public opinion - as a questionnaire presented to employees of Orange - contribute to the revolution in management procedures?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure will return to what it has always done.
Further, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the gravity of its own failures.
And finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are college graduates for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
For the sake of intellectual comfort, they adopt the old behavioral theory, now revived by the "non-sciences" of the United States and widely disseminated without much knowledge by the scientific institutes and the media.
With the fact that it is possible to move the "peak" (sic) involvement of managers, a recent survey by the Ipsos agency on the website Figaro.fr showed, which only establishes managers in their position of mechanical control, unsuitable for today's world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the managerial revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises presupposes the adoption of a final vision of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating basic insight into all management intentions and practices: For employees, commitments to the company will only be possible if they appear as a clear means to achieve their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, this concept of employee motivation is only addressed by the study of Motivational Functional Analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their businesses on the basis of a pre-determined doxy that will allow them, through an image that tells about the company, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can control, predict and anticipate their “social performance” and put their human resource management “on the right track.”
This creates a breeding ground for the development of sound and efficient economic intelligence.
In a speech from Oslo: "just war" Obama earned praise from the right.
The U.S. right welcomed a speech delivered by Barack Obama a day earlier in Oslo, pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner had championed the concept of a “just war” against the enemies of the United States.
The Conservatives, who first mocked Obama’s October 9 award, this time applauded the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, a former vice presidential candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, a right-wing Republican muse, told USA Today, adding that she herself had expressed the “sometimes necessary” war on the subject in her memoirs that are just coming out.
Of course, war is the last thing Americans want to have at work, but it is necessary.
All terrorists should be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq after his predecessor George W. Bush, justified the deployment of forces in Oslo on Thursday and used a speech to clarify his decision to send another 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days before that.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who appreciated above all the President's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I considered this speech to be completely historical, Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, who some consider a possible Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see a "left-wing president" remind members of the Nobel Prize committee that they themselves would not be free and could not hand over the prize for peace if the use of force did not exist.
According to Michael Gerson, former speechwriter George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a “very American speech.”
Not only did he introduce himself as a “world citizen” as always, but he “spoke as American president” and reminded Europeans “that they live in a safe bubble that they didn’t create themselves, and that they don’t do too much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Few of the right-wing dissenters include Bush-era hawk, former U.N. Ambassador John Bolton, who called the speech "uniform, bubbling and uninspired," as he stated on the National Review Online website.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich, for example, is horrified to see Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
“When we wrap the war in a box of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people,” he warned.
The left-wing press, however, has taken a laudable stance on the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times still considers the awarding of the Peace Prize to Obama premature, he has hailed his performance as a "surplus" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech from Oslo should serve as a guide to international decisions in conflict resolution, in the fight against poverty and oppression,” the Californian daily said.
Obama “made the speech as necessary,” the New York Times said, calling it “simple and instructive.”
Road transporters: three marathons to an agreement that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three marathon negotiations, the road transport unions and the TLF, the only employers’ organisation that remained until the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that ended the call for a strike and the threat that hung over the supply of supplies for Christmas.
The Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, expressed his "joy" at the signing of the agreement on Friday, after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After the second night of discussions, the negotiators parted ways early on Friday morning with the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible at the end of the morning.
And this despite the fact that three employers' organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew from the negotiations.
But it took more than six hours of the meeting, which began at 11 a.m. for everyone to agree and at 18 a.m. for the signing of the agreement.
The conflict "would do a great deal of harm to businesses" and "would threaten to disrupt the holiday season at the end of the year," Bussereau said.
The text contains a 4% wage increase for the lowest salaries (for local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest salaries (international transport).
The hourly wage for the lowest salaries increases from <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>8.72 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>9.06.
It’s not much, but there’s a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight, we're giving our members an order not to block, no supply center blocks.
But there may be a few more opponents who are not satisfied," he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the "correct deal", although it was difficult to admit the increase in high salaries due to international competition.
According to him, there will be an increase of 170 euros per month for the lowest salaries and 100 to 120 euros for the highest ones.
It is a common sense agreement and respect for employees, said CMaxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the "historic agreement".
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an "acceptable compromise".
The agreement also envisages a 3% revalorisation of travel expenses and a report on the state of road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also focus on the issue of the 13th salary and the modernisation of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled "a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million reduction in corporate payroll taxes" which was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 budget bill voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a "consistent" vote.
The signature allows this agreement to apply first to the enterprises that are members of this organization, later to the whole branch, in case of extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place "as soon as possible," Bussereau said.
The whole process can only be slowed by employers’ organizations’ disagreements.
The FNTR says it is a “bad deal” because <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>100 million “has already been offered to the sector as compensation for part of the carbon tax”.
The Secretary of State for Transport forced us to act in an emergency, not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to make the turkey eaters angry at the time of the approaching Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For Otre, the deal threatens to "bury a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises in the industry" in the next 12 months.
suburban trains RER A: interruption of transport at the weekend, trade unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the transport company RATP.
The disruption of transport on the RER A suburban train line, which is the largest urban public transport line in France, will continue over the weekend, as Friday’s talks between the unions and the RATP leadership on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results in the question of the premium.
On Saturdays and Sundays, the days of an important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will run only between 10 am and 8 pm, on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) every second train will run, outside this section only one train out of four.
The connection with SNCF will be interrupted in Nanterre Préfecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
Galeries Lafayette’s department stores, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that “RATP was trying to secure a connection with large department stores.”
The RER A line leads from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The RATP-managed section leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one train out of two was at its peak, and virtually no train set was off-peak at the time, as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion at the foothills.
So early in the morning there were far fewer people in the station Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) than usual, among other things also because of the lack of pupils and students.
Jack Nbakina, an engineer, 29 years old from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he got up an hour and a half early to make sure he arrived on time.
The Saint-Lazare railway station was not overcrowded, SNCF said, predicting a greater number of rioters and security guards.
The suburban RER A trains operated by SNCF in the direction of or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare station with a metro connection.
The next general assembly of the strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday, at which the results of Friday’s afternoon meeting with the leadership will be evaluated, which the unions have rated as “weak”.
The management of the RER proposes negotiations on a special protocol for suburban RER A trains on all sides, adjustment of working hours, career progress, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who demand a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garon (OdboryJih).
RATP even postponed proposals for the premium for the time being, which worsened the CGT by saying that the management "was not able to solve the problem while with the travel companies and SNCF it was possible".
At the new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, "the conditions for the exercise of the profession will be examined in more detail," specified RATP transport companies.
This was the reason why the trade unionists thought the business was “making fun of weekend commuters.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the company committee in its Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which until now refused any discussion during the strike, therefore decided to meet in the interest of "calm down".
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to the RER B line on Tuesday, after Unsa and the Independents announce a strike alert.
The trade unions are asking for a premium ranging from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independent)) and make it difficult for the deteriorating working conditions on this line to transport a million passengers per day.
Drivers of suburban RER trains earn <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2200 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>2700 gross wages and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>600 to <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>650 premiums for irregular working hours and for work on Sundays and holidays.
The Turkish judiciary has dissolved for the Kurdish side, and this decision has serious consequences.
Turkey's Constitutional Court on Friday ruled to overturn the country's main pro-Kurdish party, prompting protests and demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the country's southeast and Istanbul.
This decision can significantly complicate the task of the government, which is trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Democratic Society Party (DTP) has been dissolved because it has become "a nest of activities threatening the independence of the state and its indivisible unity," Chief Justice Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of talks.
The decision was made unanimously by 11 judges, when a majority of seven votes was needed to dissolve the party, Kilic said, adding that 37 party cadres including its president Ahmet T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and deputy Aysely Tuglukov<0xC3><0xA1> have been banned from participating in political life for five years.
The judge also announced the abolition of parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Mr T<0xC3><0xBC>rk and Mrs Tuglukov<0xC3><0xA1> and the confiscation of the party's assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP has 21 seats (out of 500) in Parliament.
The party's leadership had already warned before the verdict that MPs would rather leave Parliament than act as MPs without political affiliation.
The decision is a continuation of the trial initiated in 2007 by the prosecutor of the cassation court Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accuses the DTP of obedience to the "commandments" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that the DTP is a legal political showcase for PKK rebels.
The party says it has no "basic connection" with the PKK, but refuses to label it a terrorist organization and calls on the government to negotiate with it.
The court’s verdict comes at a time when the government is handing the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offering a range of measures to strengthen their rights and trying to limit the Kurds’ support for the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP’s leadership has confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to renewed tensions in southeast Anatolia, where many demonstrations against conditions under which the PKK leader Abdullah <0xC3><0x96>calan is detained in clashes with police have been overturned in recent weeks.
Since the announcement of the ruling, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast that is predominantly Kurdish.
Police used tear gas and water cannons, while protesters threw Molotov cocktails or fired stones from the rubble.
About 100 people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Mr. T<0xC3><0xBC>rk said that the decision of justice will only "deepen desperation".
Turkey cannot resolve this issue (Kurdish, ed.) by banning the party, he said in the press.
The government, formed by the party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also condemned the decision.
We are in principle against interference by the parties.
There is no solution, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete blow to the democratic proposals launched by the government, commented political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can wait for the reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK reported one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, killing seven soldiers three days earlier.
The snow may come
A pretty crispy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he wants to bully citizens, says the head of the winter technical services department of the FES.
But so that its employees can try and learn to control all the vehicle technology.
This could happen for the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
More than 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of snow and ice.
The FES is proceeding according to the precise plan.
As soon as it snows all over Frankfurt and temperatures drop below zero, they will go out to 20 so-called A-ranges, Brauburger explains.
These sections include major and transit routes such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transport lines, pedestrian zones and sections with descents such as Atzelbergstra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
The FES service starts at three in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary to sprinkle a moist salt that holds better, about 1040 kilometers in a maximum of three hours.
Therefore, the FES starts at three o’clock in the night, “so that the roads are free when the traffic to work begins”.
It's not easy when it starts to snow until 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical services department, "because no one is willing to make room for the sprinklers."
Only when there is so much snow, there are a number of access and connecting communications, including the Rat-Beil-Stra<0xC3><0x9F>e.
The last priority is the side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they'll be complaining there.
At five o’clock in the morning, FES pedestrians will start their journey, preferably cleaning dangerous places and crossings.
FES usually can't take care of all the bike paths.
In Frankfurt there is a special service, which monitors from 22 to 4.30 mainly bridges, says Brauburger.
As they quickly form an iceberg, the sinks leave immediately as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also call you.
The Cradle of Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other carnivorous dinosaurs: The animal, two meters long and 1.50 meters high, ran along two strong hind limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short front limbs with sickle claws and claw claws.
If this species lived a few million years later, it would be nothing special.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in the Thursday issue of the journal Science write that Tawa Hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with these bodily features.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then in the equatorial dry region of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window on the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It shows us a lot about kinship relationships, expansions, and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for triassic deposits, reports team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavations, they collected the remains of a total of five individuals.
The findings confirm theories about the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbitt, this is an unusual finding: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are very rare, usually only individual fragments are found."
Other experts on dinosaurs do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This finding is not particularly sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is usually controversial.
Experts discuss, for example, when lizards split into the three most important lines of development: carnivorous theropods, which later included Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor, and also birds, "long-nosed" four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and protozoans.
Tawa hallae is the original terapod after the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced properties, says Nesbitt.
On the skull of Tawa hallae, for example, researchers found evidence of air sacs, which even the descendants of theropods have birds.
Thanks to air vacuums, breathing birds is more effective than mammals.
At Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partly filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of giant sauropods later also had air sacs and light bones, this useful innovation has probably formed a common ancestor of both groups.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists have concluded that the lizards first appeared there.
According to this, the three lines of development split early on and spread from South America to all the continents that, as the supercontinent of Pangaea at that time, formed a unified mass of the earth.
She would also talk about the fact that the team found, together with Tawa hallae, the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
These three cannot come from one common, immigrant ancestor, the researchers argue.
We believe there have been at least three migration waves to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the scientific study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of heaviest dinosaurs, lived in present-day Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His hypothesis could put together a distorted picture, because in South America there are preserved very many primitive fossils of dinosaurs, while on other continents they are rarely found.
As dinosaurs have shown that they evolved from a relatively rare by-line of reptiles to the dominant vertebrates on earth during the Earth’s Middle Ages, it still remains a puzzle.
During the Triassic, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, including the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying lizards, and countless other lizards.
Around the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread around the world and many new species evolved, while relatives became extinct and the interface of the Triassic and the Jury.
The success story didn’t last forever.
There are two hypotheses for explaining this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction that dinosaurs accidentally survived, but the reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better, so they could push out the competition.
The success story didn’t last forever.
150 million years later, the meteorite’s impact helped another group of animals, which also evolved in the Triassic and has been living in the shadows ever since: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna, or Berkeley, California.
Associate professors from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen joined.
The police clearance of the occupied casino of the Goethe University of Frankfurt has taken care of a worldwide upheaval.
The 278 professors and faculty at Goethe University, as well as universities across Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they do not “approve” of the inciting police intervention by the Presidium.
Because the walls and artwork were plastered, University President Werner M<0xC3><0xBC>ller-Estler had the building cleaned up by striking students and lecturers last week.
Five students were injured.
The damage to the case, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the self-organized teaching of students and teachers by the police command".
Clearing is an "unacceptable interference" with the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to "unauthorized and criminalize protest" and distracts attention from the content.
The Bureau avoided the necessary discussion.
The speakers call for an end to the criminal prosecution.
It is claimed that the majority of the strikers did not support material injury.
Justified protest
The youth unions of Verdi and the German Trade Union also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one’s own future, says the mysterious Earth Youth of Verdi Alexander Klein.
The Minister of Science of Hesse, Eva K<0xC3><0xBC>hne-H<0xC3><0xB6>rmann (CDU), is currently defending the university president’s and the police.
We are grateful to the President of the University.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said on Thursday in the Aktuellen Stunde (Current Hour) in the Wiesbaden Land Assembly.
We have an understanding for protest, but we have no understanding for vandalism, said Peter Beuth, a member of the House of Representatives for the CDU.
Otherwise, the opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and the Left saw it.
The CDU takes the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, there was a clean-up.
Linke submitted a proposal calling on the interior minister to submit a report on the police deployment.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years, it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the west.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital of Moscow, in the Soviet Union it was a strictly guarded location where secret armed research was carried out.
Today, this district with 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometers from the Moscow center, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important micro- and nanoelectronic research and production centers are located here.
Since September 2008, the representatives of the Green City have been in contact with the Riedberg Science Centre in Frankfurt – with the university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
Several mutual visits took place and on Wednesday Zelenograd and Ridberg signed the "Protocol on close cooperation" in Frankfurt.
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow Mayor Yuri Roslyak and the Prefect of the Green City Anatoly Smirnov, and was signed by Chief Planning Officer Edwin Schwarz for Frankfurt.
In 2010, representatives of FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in scientific research will go to the seminar in Zelenograd.
Scientific Exchanges
This is an ongoing scientific exchange.
It is also about economic relations.
FIZ companies will be allowed to get caught up in the growing Russian market.
On the contrary, Russian scientific companies want to get jobs in Germany.
Zelenograd is home to important Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, the large companies Sitronics and Rossiyskaya Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planned city" for armed research.
Zelenograd (literally "Green City") got its name from the wooded hilly landscape into which research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart-Brandenburg
The Stuttgart 21 dimension cannot be sufficiently prepared at all.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply a "new heart of Europe".
Well, the S21 is more than a station launch, more than a monstrous building that will plunge the capital of Baden-W<0xC3><0xBC>rttemberg into a decade of desperate construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was born out of the spirit of the 80s.
The main stations with railways that ended in the city center were then considered as 19th-century transport-technical fossils, which act as a brake on modern rail transport, because it took an enormous amount of time to rewind the locomotives backwards.
Take it, stop for a moment, go on - that's how it should work.
And that is why the main railway stations are disappearing: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies about halfway along the trans-European railway line between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - that's why the slogan about "the heart of Europe".
It really starts with the S21, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves realized that in the Hessian and Bavarian metropolis, the start of construction is almost unfinanced.
As long as there are modern commuter trains with motor and control vehicles on both ends, the main stations no longer have problems with commuting and leaving.
Still: It starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE to Ulm route.
This was done by local and local politicians.
The railways cooperate, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayer and not by the state concern.
In urban planning, the project can still be excused in some way.
A new urban space will be created, which - if we trust the computer images of the designers - will contain a lot of greenery.
The S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
Transit stations and the construction of the line are intended for passenger transport, which - typically in the 80s - attributed a huge increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights.
However, modern transport policy must first of all be about the strengthening of freight transport, because rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than trucking on the road.
But the new route is not suitable for freight trains due to the steep climb.
Even more serious is that the S21 indirectly affects a lot of other railway projects.
A good <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>6 billion was to be buried in Swabia.
That's the official number.
Experts consider the real 10 to 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for other nodes and bottlenecks in the network.
There are 60 major projects on the Ministry of Transport’s list.
One of the most important is the construction of a 180 km long route through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, it has been building at a slow pace on this route.
There would have to be a lot of pressure here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The route through the Rhine valley will become the neck of the bottle of international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is investigating the verdict on the airport.
The Land Government has left the Wiesbaden Land Chamber open to whether it will go against the decision of the Hesse Administrative Court (VGH) regarding the ban on night flights and have it revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has mandated experts to legally assess more than 400-page VGH judgment, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
VGH in Kassel today justified in writing that in the case of the construction of the planned northwest runway of the Frankfurt airport, the state would have to re-adjust the night ban on flights.
A permit for 17 flights between 11 pm and 5 pm, according to the country's government, does not comply with the law to protect the population from night-time airborne noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 whether to request a review of the verdict.
The opposition criticized the postponement and urged the government representative to resign from the review of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The SPD leader Torsten Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel urged the CDU and the FDP to return to the promises regarding the ban on night flights, which she gave before the election. Otherwise, it can be assessed as a "violation of the word".
It's damn hard if you can keep your word, Greens chief Tarek Al-Wazir said in reference to the FDP's election slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch has rejected Sch<0xC3><0xA4>fer-G<0xC3><0xBC>mbel’s rebuke, the country’s government is trying to get to its night flights by “scrolling the law and the trick.”
Accurate legal control takes time.
The coalition does not want to work on the basis of a "quick first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan M<0xC3><0xBC>ller (FDP).
His faction’s statements on banning night flights have never been the same as the opposition’s.
U.S. banks to pay for aid
American, crisis-stricken big banks are getting rid of state bonds.
Bank of America paid a total of $45 billion (around <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>30 billion) in aid from the Tarp bank rescue fund on Wednesday.
According to the report of the American station CNBC, Citigroup also plans to pay the state aid.
The constitutions therefore want to get rid of the restrictions that have been imposed by accepting money - restrictions on the payment of bonuses to managers and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America has made $19 billion in net cash available to investors through convertible bonds.
She took the rest of the amount from her cash register, which was filled, among other things, thanks to union sales.
The head of the bank Kenneth Lewis on Wednesday evening expressed his gratitude to the American taxpayer: Money injections helped us to overcome the difficult times.
The monetary institution has hurt itself at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also wants to free itself from its obligations to the state by raising money on the capital market.
CNBC, citing sources, said the U.S. bank could have announced a capital increase of about $20 billion as early as Thursday.
Citigroup spokesman declined to comment on the matter.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid for the aid.
Quick Choices
It went faster than expected, though.
The station introduced the successor just two weeks after the ZDF’s board of directors expelled the editor-in-chief, Nikolaus Brender, from office.
Last night, the grémium wanted to make a deal on that person.
Peter Frey, head of the ZDF studio in Berlin, was named the favourite.
However, the station did not confirm it - officially, so as not to pre-empt the process.
However, the role could also be played by the fact that they did not want to harm ZDF Superintendent Markus Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, if this proposal was not passed by the Board of Directors.
Frey, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the grémie.
The result of the vote was not known before the conclusion of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter failed in the board of directors with his proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
There were only seven votes for Brender, seven against him, and Brender's loss of office was a bitter defeat for Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, though she could be expected.
The EU’s majority in the board of directors had signalled several weeks before the elections that it did not want to confirm Brender in office.
Opposition to the editor-in-chief was organized by the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to stay in the office of the high-ranking editor-in-chief, arguing that Brender's surveillance quotas for ZDF reporting had fallen.
Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
For the last time, 35 lawyers of state law have interfered in the debate, who consider Koch’s procedure to be unconstitutional.
It wasn't for nothing.
About us
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and romance.
He then worked for S<0xC3><0xBC>dwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal referent editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and moderator "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 head of foreign policy of the ZDF; since then head of the main study of the ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected Medium Magazine's Journalist of the Year on Wednesday, was sacked, the Greens announced they were filing a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch’s anti-candidate on the board, the Rhine-False prime minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the federal states should change the state contract with the ZDF so that the lieutenant’s personal proposals could not be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck, however, also rejected the exclusion of party politicians from the ZDF supervisory boards.
Brender's intended successor, Peter Frey, gave the board a clever chess move - immediately after Brender's dismissal, he strongly criticized the grémium for it.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, he could have been nominated as editor-in-chief without losing face like Sch<0xC3><0xA4>chter, so he could have been elected to the board of directors without being suspected of being pushed into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is well-placed as a left-wing liberal.
Study to get rid of Haramp<0xC3><0xA1>d<0xC3><0xAD>
Partly successful for students: After a year of strikes, the ministers of culture finally arrived in the federal states on Thursday: At a conference of ministers of culture and university rectors, both sides agreed that there is a will to improve the study conditions for bachelors and masters.
Students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
Specifically, they agreed to reduce the test load: Essentially, each study module should be completed with a single test.
In addition, the workload of students should be reviewed and a "real and justifiable level" should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities in Germany and abroad.
The L<0xC3><0xA4>nder undertake to create a more flexible joint structural assignment for the bachelor’s and master’s degree fields of study.
Earth's deviations should cease to exist.
Less Tests
Since the start of student protests in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have had words in their mouths about better study.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with concrete content.
The so-called accreditation board has decided that the number of exams will be reduced in part drastically: "Each module will usually be completed with only one exam", writes the 30-page report, which is to partly re-regulate the approval of the study fields.
"A markedly lower test load," said Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the accreditation board, "is to be stopped by a faulty development that significantly limited the study's complexity."
To this end, the "demand for study" in the future should be a "decisive criterion" in the implementation.
Modules and content must be "hardly reviewed" so that they "do not unduly restrict students when choosing
The Seminars.”
Students should have “a right to a space that allows and supports their own initiative”.
The rules shall apply when approving new fields of study, but also after review for existing fields of study.
These need to be “re-accredited” every five years – which means it will take until 2015 to review all fields of study.
Ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany are responsible for this, which are subject to accreditation councils set up by the federal states.
Culture ministers in October called on the federal government to act on the agencies so that the curriculum was not too large and the testing regime was not strict.
In individual federal states, universities and colleges have already agreed with the land ministries on appropriate measures.
As yet, the only country to have pledged additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process.
Out of the money, universities should primarily pay for consulting programs and study advice, and strengthen testing and foreign authorities.
Countries and universities want to spend <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>10 million on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government wants to submit an amendment to the university law to the parliament.
According to her, only one test should be required to complete the study module.
The formation of the study should be even more flexible, in order to ensure the recognition of exams from other universities and to facilitate the accessibility of the master's degree.
By the end of next year, the demands of all fields of study in the country should be reviewed.
The government and the opposition reneged on the study conditions in the country on Thursday.
In addition to praise, criticism of the resolution also fell.
The Federal Board of Higher Education Groups called for the formation of education policy not to take place in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, "at least a word should be said" also students as affected persons.
Future academics also received support from the President of the Conference of Rectors of Higher Education (HRK), Margreta Wintermantelov<0xC3><0xA1>: "We need the experience of students," she said at a meeting with Culture Ministers on Thursday, with whom the HRK discussed a joint reform report.
According to the Departments of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolution did not go far enough: They require a legal claim that would allow every graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access an additional master’s degree.
Second, the federal states must ensure that there are enough places in the master’s degree fields tomorrow for today’s generation of undergraduate students with the best possible study conditions, said GEW Board Member Andreas Keller.
The countries of the Union must employ far more speakers.
However, the Ministers of Culture did not express their views on free access to master’s programmes.
More than a note below the line to Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller
To get to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." is the opening line of a poem by the poet Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner, which in this torn language piece thematicizes the experience of the arrival of a dissident who gained freedom, but at the same time lost his language environment.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner was born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, he worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer at a children's book publishing company, then in 1982 he moved to Frankfurt am Main.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner was awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he lectured poetry at the legendary Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hesse Forum of Literature at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
He took care of a significant extra-literary stir last Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which dealt with "German literature in Romania in a mirror and a broken mirror of its security acts".
Evidently disembodied and infected, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner left a statement in which he admitted to cooperating as a secret informant of the Romanian secret service Securitate, in front of colleagues of Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmut Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner won the German Language Prize in 1989.
Attempts at recruiting reportedly began inconspicuously, first in 1971.
I am, S<0xC3><0xB6>llner continued, "that is, someone who has not sufficiently resisted attempts at intimidation by the Securitate."
The poet Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is the secret agent Walter.
Almost at the same time as the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller and her unprecedented literary dealings with the mechanisms of dictatorial government, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that points to the depths and hans.
Werner S<0xC3><0xB6>llner is not, at least if it can be said according to the state of knowledge so far, only the perpetrator, but he is also the victim.
In the Securitate files, Secret Agent Walter played a role, said after S<0xC3><0xB6>llner's confession Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence of Secret Agent Walter on himself.
“He cut me in all the points that were important to him at the time,” says Markel.
It is his moral duty to make this remark.
S<0xC3><0xB6>llner's statement was in this form and before this audience unexpected, but completely surprising admission of the former dissident and his cooperation with the Romanian secret service is not.
Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller wrote as early as July, when she read her own papers, 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reservation for the Securitate spies.
Concerns, it can be assumed, will speculate and in some cases even know what the name is hiding behind the cover name Sorin, Voic, and also Walter.
Unlike in the domestic, meanwhile already very certain view of the Stazi files, the manipulation with the remnants of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systematic education has been marred and restricted.
One of Birthler’s offices, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of Securities (CNSAS), was founded only in 1999, the issuance of the act has been rather lengthy since then.
Only since 2005 there is a law that governs the management of files.
After the publication of the Nobel Prize for Hertu M<0xC3><0xBC>ller, one interview in which one of the former heads of Securitate from Temesv<0xC3><0xA1>r expressed his disapproval of the prize-winner showed that former Securitate members still have a great influence in Romania.
She's psychotic, after all, she's only been interviewed once.
The contempt of power here has been expressed quite unobtrusively in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, the S<0xC3><0xB6>llner case, as in the case of the silenced guilt, is bound up with the inevitable questions.
The peculiar reaction of the listeners to S<0xC3><0xB6>llner's confession makes one expect that the continuation of this chapter will determine the desire for knowledge rather than the attribution of guilt and shame.
To the genesis of Herta M<0xC3><0xBC>ller’s work, which received the Nobel Prize yesterday, this is more than a footnote.
Saturated deposit Champions League
It seemed as if a clean-clothed salesman had come from a cute Christmas party at which he was handing out sweets to the sports goods manufacturer, as he was entering a quarter of an hour after midnight in the called Mercedes C-class new coach VfBr Christian Gross accompanied by a s<0xC3><0xA1>baran.
The man with the distinctive baldness was driven by a strange city.
Otherwise, he could drive alone - alcohol was not in the game, and a 55-year-old man drunk with happiness was also little.
It was a pleasant evening, but tomorrow it will continue to work.
Or it's just beginning.
The words of the three-day-old Swiss: "We have reached the semi-finals," in the Champions League thanks to a 3:1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "but we must not let ourselves be dazzled by the success: it will be a brutally hard fight against the downhill."
"The far more important task" is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class even in the ordinary league day.
And avoid repeated obvious weaknesses after the three quick goals of Marica (5th), Tr<0xC3><0xA4>sche (8th) and Pogrebnyaka (11th).
Draw
The Champions League semi-finals (races 16/17 + 23/24 February/ rematch 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel’s successor will therefore remain.
Not only in the case of an alleged healer, who gave uncertain Stuttgart professionals confidence, willingness to deploy and joy from the game in a short period of time.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and urged them to be braver, explained soul healer Gross so simply sounding a successful recipe, but which by the action of therapist Babbel did not prove any more effective.
Babbel’s aide Jens Lehmann said, “When there’s a new impulse in football, sometimes things happen that you wouldn’t consider possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who, after a week-long break from injury, became the best player on the field thanks to his dynamism, tried to describe the phenomenon with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working procedures of the new boss: "He is a man who is radical and disciplined.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
It was obviously missing for Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart has not yet been saved, warns sports chairman Horst Heldt
VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
Like Gross, neither the players nor the managers want to overestimate the victory against the weakened substitute and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would have won in Glasgow before there was an ugly awakening after the 0:4 defeat in Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
And sports chairman Horst Heldt recalled that while one goal was achieved in the season, the other is still a long way off.
We're not out of water yet.
The fact that Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first home win in three months was due to weekend events that came to life in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that are made by others and not by Jens, Heldt replied to Lehman's harsh criticism.
He pre-empted the board of weak leadership and decided to change the coach after pressure from pubertal fans.
Even though his day off after the games was cancelled, Lehmann described it as a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehman's statements "formulate pure egoism," Heldt replied, announcing the consequences for the goalkeepers.
The 40-year-olds will no longer have any joy in life.
In any case, they agree with each other that without the work of the suspended coaching team, such a strong and combative performance would not be possible.
Babbel and his assistants had "a great share of success," Heldt and Lehmann say unanimously - and the man with the needle bag agrees.
World Heavyweight Championship (World Heavyweight Championship)
Passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked the words and gestures of world champion Vitalija Klitschko.
However, after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title in the heavyweight boxing organization WBC.
The judges’ verdict was unanimous.
Hamburg - Vitalij Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko remains the world heavyweight boxing champion.
The 38-year-old WBC champion beat American Kevin Johnson unanimously on Saturday night in Bern (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
This is Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ka's third successful title defense since his return in October 2008.
Previously, he was twice the World Champion of WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it didn't happen to the K.O. everyone was expecting.
Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko improved his balance sheet to 39 wins in 41 professional matches, having been twice defeated due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th match.
In front of about 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, Klitschko led the 2.02-meter-high fight mainly with his left hand.
Eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who announced the end of Klitschko's era before the duel, but retreated before the world champion's blows, so Klitschko could not make a decisive blow with his dangerous right.
In total, the passive Johnson did little to the challenger and tried only to get into the next laps.
Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ka provoked words and gestures, but his blows were rarely hit by the world champion.
But it is still only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought with Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ek full twelve laps.
The challenger took care of the riots in the Swiss capital before the battle.
He insulted Klitschko as a "resisting zombie" who "doesn't know much".
During Friday's weigh-in, he let the champion be provoked, pulling Johnson's sunglasses from his nose "so he could see his eyes."
The fourth victory after Klitschko's return
Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko remained undefeated even after the fourth match after his return on 11 October 2008.
After a nearly four-year hiatus, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back "his" WBC belt, which he had to surrender without a fight before.
That year, he defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and Chris Arreol of the United States.
In this fight I only got one shot and I was physically in good shape, Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ko justified a quick return to the ring.
His dream, however, remains the defense of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladim<0xC3><0xAD>r is the world champion of WBO and IBF organizations.
The WBA belt, however, is worn by Brit David Haye, after he was knocked down from the 2.13-metre-high throne of Nikolai Vulaev in November.
Haye gave up the fight against Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ek in the summer, which was scheduled for September.
His promotion company is reportedly planning a fight against Kli<0xC4><0x8D>ek at London's Wembley Stadium.
The Kund<0xC3><0xBA>z case
Leader of the opposition: Green Party leader J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin called the Kund<0xC3><0xBC>z affair of Defence Minister Guttenberg a lie.
The SPD and Linke (Left) call on the Chancellor to provide an explanation.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest information about the attack on Kunduz, the opposition believes that Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) committed a deliberate deception.
The minister on the deadly bombing of two tankers in September said "consciously false," Green Party chief J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin said on Saturday's ARD "Tagesschau" news programme.
Let’s call it the usual expression: a lie.
The order to kill was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
That is the essence of the NATO report that Mr Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not only about the destruction of the stolen trucks, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
According to a NATO investigation, as many as 142 people were killed or injured in the US airstrike demanded by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein.
Zelen<0xC3><0xAD>, the SPD and Linke on Saturday called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event.
Mrs Merkel has to explain whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Federal Parliament - and whether the Chancellor's Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have endorsed this new strategy, urged J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Trittin and Green colleague Renate K<0xC3><0xBC>nastov<0xC3><0xA1>.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm strongly rejected the criticism.
The chancellor's office has no influence on the specific deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, doubts were also raised about the Ministry’s portrayal of the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, both Guttenbergs were informed correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tanks.
Officially, they were supposed to deny the existence of NATO reports and silence the minister of sensitive details.
The two top officials, however, said they had alerted the Department of Defense to several reports, including a two-page document from Colonel Klein's commanding officer and a report from the military police.
"Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert should have asked in the letter for clarification.
It is noted that he has not yet received any response.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be dealt with in the inquiry committee of the Bundestag, which will be set up next Wednesday.
Worlds of Dreams
Some see images in the waking state and hear voices that others do not see and do not hear.
It is not only the mentally ill or the drug addicts who draw the line between imagination and reality.
As long as it happens in your sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we may be surrounded by the wildest imaginations and fantasy delusions.
However, those who experience dream states in alertness, see and hear things that others do not see and do not hear, in today’s Western world are usually considered crazy or drug-addicted, or at least as strange.
However, such images and voices do not arise only in the mentally ill or in drug addiction.
Our imagination is at fault: The same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint paintings or write novels, will make sure here and there that the boundaries between dream, idea and reality merge.
Dreams of a changed state of consciousness can occur in various forms, at best we call them visions, at worst delusions.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, the visions of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the prophet New-Age Carlos Castaneda, shamanic states of delusion, psychosis and hallucination can be deduced from similar processes.
Hallucinations or visions occur when the balance of the brain’s neural transmitters—especially dopamine, noradrenaline, serotonin, and acetylcholine—is derailed, and interactions between different parts of the brain are disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusions are very common in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity doesn't have much power over it.
The connection between delusion and dream has been employed by philosophers and physicians since antiquity.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of waking sleep, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, noted in 1861 "a great similarity of delusion with dream states", for Sigmund Freud, the dream was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, delusions of the senses".
It's the fall of 2001, Henning T. is turning into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and squeaky colorful.
Gravity has no power over it, hovering at the ceiling of the room.
He's feeling a kick.
Behind him are winged devil figures with blood-red grimaces, appreciating teeth.
He chases him, kicks him in heavy, fiery shoes, throws him against the wall, feels pain all over his body.
Loud, bad voices threaten from the walls and the radio.
He can no longer tolerate the voices that overwhelm and offend him.
Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo, takes them into a loop and attaches them to the hook on the ceiling.
He climbs on one speaker and loops around his neck.
Jumping.
The loop allows.
Teach yourself, shouting chorus voices ripping his drums, "Go to the clinic and let yourself be cured!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, experienced six acute psychosis, the last 2 years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was launched.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is manic-depressive, taking drugs against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He has learned to live with his illness and has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I have experienced the worst fear and the deepest doubts, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality.
About one percent of people suffer from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric clinics it is the second most frequently treated disease after depression.
With acute schizophrenic psychosis, the disabled can no longer usually distinguish between the inner and outer worlds, they get into an exaggerated state, which can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
It is especially common to hear voices – voices that command, comment on, or lead dialogues.
Even optical hallucinations are not uncommon.
The affected person is not able to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain can not filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like a dream, psychosis opens up a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is focused on the subject, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the General Psychiatry Clinic of Heidelberg University Clinic.
Schizophrenics are at the center of events, everything has a meaning directed at them.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becomes, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is usually not possible in them, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
Once in a lifetime to experience hallucinations
But unlike in a dream, Fuchs says, “the sensory and spatial structure of reality that one perceives in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved.”
Misguided thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, the alienation of the experience takes place in a real context.
Scientists are still puzzled as to why exactly our brains are doing such sweeps.
“Exceptional states can cause any person to lose their relationship to reality in the short term,” Fuchs says.
Not everyone will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists believe that the affected people have minimal damage to the brain.
We believe that at an early stage of development, neuronal maturation of the brain will be damaged, for example, by viral diseases of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
However, it remains a puzzle as to how the neuronal system will be disrupted, which has not manifested itself in any way for many years.
The influence of the surroundings also plays a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis, if it is predisposed to it.
Also hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain gets sweaty
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffers from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive drugs, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten from L<0xC3><0xBC>beck.
Whether we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often only a question of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, last year interpreting his results in the book "Die unreale Welt in nous Kopf" (The unreal world in our head).
Hallucinations belong to the typical accompanying phenomena of psychosis, but also to a surprising number of other diseases.
In addition to mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder or depression, diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s or brain trauma are also common.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brain of a healthy person hallucinates.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or under-repressed; if our brain is digested, or when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also the withdrawal of stimuli, stress, anxiety with love or other exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to a third of those surveyed have experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends the gymnasium there.
Actually, she's a normal girl.
If only there weren't the shapes and the voices.
It can happen that she is approached by a colonnade with long, dark hair.
When she answers, her classmates look at her with surprise - no one but her sees and hears this boy.
This shy girl thinks she's a dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn't, she knows.
He is awake, hearing and seeing the boy, just as he is hearing and seeing the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He may even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It's a nice feeling, he likes the boy.
Am I crazy? he asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the signs are more conspicuous
Often, overcrowding is a burden.
When sitting in the classroom, he can not watch the lesson many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is just presenting a new classmate, while he explains to everyone else audibly and visibly on the table of the mathematical equation.
At night, the sightings are rather discouraging.
When she waits in her dark room for sleep, which comes rarely and too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already asleep, whether the images she sees, the grimaces, or the girl with bleeding cut wounds on her hands and feet, arise in front of her.
Leave me alone, screaming at the characters.
She doesn't tell her parents and friends about it, they'd think she'd gone crazy.
Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is now 20 years old.
She graduated last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, hallucinations stopped.
Ever since she contacted the psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows she didn't go crazy.
Insanity is also the art of despair.
If someone is socially isolated or their stimuli are removed, they are more likely to have hallucinations, Kasten says.
I think that the brain then does not have enough work and takes care of its own fun.
Sarah K., the only child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she had been calling her father since she thought herself was not her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations are active in the same brain areas that also process real sensations and sounds, it is difficult for the affected like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusions and reality. "Every experience," says Kasten, "is played out in the brain, also from reality.
Hallucinations are also images that allow the brain to arise, so it works so realistically.”
Nighttime dreams also evaluate casten as a form of hallucination.
The hallucination of healthy people is not fundamentally different from the hallucination in acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Therefore, Kasten advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as an extraordinary ability.
The borderline between sleep and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our over-concentrated world, the imaginary experience is mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor at Heidelberg and head of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic at Florence-Nightingale Hospital in D<0xC3><0xBC>sseldorf.
Psychosis is a serious, painful disease, but it also brings positive, creativity - a delusion is also the art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a peculiar form of altered consciousness to dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictitious dreams that the person concerned considers real and cannot even distinguish them from the waking state.
The oneiroid state of consciousness arises in extreme situations caused by trauma or disease, for example, patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor paralysis in full consciousness.
When a person is threatened by the loss of the world and himself, perhaps by a permanent, complete inability to move, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with his own imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, Schmidt-Degenhard says.
Type of borderline state between sleep and hallucination.
Because in reality it is not possible to cope with a situation, there will be a change of worlds, but the real situation will be present in the imagination.
An intense form of support for the senses and the transference of the senses in some intolerable situation that allows people to move within an instant into the loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in the memories
Also the art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (Exchange of heart) as a rescue action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after heart valve surgery and subsequent heart transplant, his consciousness was released on a several-day journey, with his body lying motionless on the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunged into the world he created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an old man trapped in a bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
It lives in the early Middle Ages among the nobility, which produces narcotic substances from blood.
On a motorbike, he is taken by the Greek to his homeland, surfed on a hospital bed in the Alps, and met by a Korean mobster.
It sinks completely into the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in the memories.
For Claussen, these inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream.
A dream is a different state, it describes its experience.
Contrary to dreams, the memories of these mental journeys are still clear after years and in minor details.
Even brighter and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid states, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug addiction show how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in the waking state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a deformation of what we call reality."
A reality that can also be enriching.
The snow may come
Burda
At 27 they have to take over the publishing house children
The new publisher Kallen is a transitional solution: For a long time, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
In the future, the company will still be 100 percent owned by the family.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his business in the hands of his children for a long time.
Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and have a firm will to enter the business, says 69-year-old man SPIEGEL.
We dealt with the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is raised only afterwards.
The question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is not possible to put 7,500 employees at the head of their children if they are not capable enough.
That would kill both the children and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he had been stepping down from the board of directors since January, and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Burdy Board of Directors since 1999.
First, he was in charge of technology.
Later, responsibility for the company’s assets was added to the Treasury, and after the resignation of J<0xC3><0xBC>rgen Todenh<0xC3><0xB6>fer also Direct Marketing, Foreign Affairs, Press and Finance.
For the first time, none of the family members are at the head of the publishing house.
Burd's children are 19 and 17, his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a few years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also serves to "overtake 10, 15 years," Burd said.
The holding company should still be 100 percent of the family in the future, Burda says.
In the Schickedanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that even family businesses have no certainty of extinction: “It’s always affected companies that got infected by the desire for capital that they speculated and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had “dreams of world power,” Burda says.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country like Springer was, and I don't want to play the World League with Time, these deals are too big.
Comprehensive care of beauty
Everything you can wish for in the area of beauty and well-being, you have at your fingertips.
This was the intention of El Corte Inglés, which has just started operations of the Callao (Madrid) shopping center with an area of more than 1000 m2, which provides a variety of services in the field of body care.

Varied necklines
Christmas is coming and it’s a time when it’s appropriate to find out what celebrities are wearing, and adjust your festive wardrobe to it as well.
The shape of the cut is very important to emphasize the figure, which is necessary to keep in mind.
We make a few suggestions.
Singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut. We do not recommend.
Endesa in Barcelona, with electric car
The energy company Endesa, together with the Barcelona City Council, founded the ‘Live Office’.
This is a project for the development and promotion of electric vehicles in the capital of Catalonia.
The Office LIVE' (Logistics for the introduction of electric vehicles) establishes and will manage the travel plan for the introduction of electric vehicles in the city and will ensure agreements in the field of mobility, will manage, coordinate and submitcontributions, etc.
It will also develop the projectMOVELE, promote electric vehicles, collect opinions and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to promote this means of transport of the future.
3 'electrical cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city to join the project to introduce electric cars in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will also join the project.
These are the three cities that the government has chosen as part of the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric vehicles.
Energy company Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan autonomous region.
This includes activities related to energy and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative involving Endesa with regard to the promotion of electric vehicles.
The company is represented in European standardization teams and actively carries out a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero predicts a 'rest period' in the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodr<0xC3><0xAD>guez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the main export sector of the state, is waiting for a "peaceful period".
In the 2009 Economic Report of the Prime Minister, Zapatero summarized the measures that were introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competitive Plan for the automotive sector, we would be left with a state of abandonment, the closure of some of our main production facilities," the Prime Minister said.
"Thanks to this plan and the desire of the individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of calm is expected in the future for this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this sense, he pointed out that the Competitive Plan, which forms part of the Integral Plan of the Automotive Industry (PIA), allocated 800 million to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 auxiliary companies that mobilized an investment exceeding 3 billion euros.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended to develop new models, to modernize production and existing processes.
Zapatero also highlighted the government’s measures to support the demand and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is being implemented in cooperation with autonomous areas and car brands.
According to the president, this plan allowed to reduce the average level of emissions of new vehicles sold in the Spanish market by 6%, and ensured a "significant increase" in registrations, specifically in November by "40 percent".
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles.
Madrid will host the first International Classic Car Show, a meeting place for professionals and amateurs from the world of motorsport.
This initiative will take place on February 5-7, 2010 at the Casa de Campo Glass Pavilion in Madrid.
This is an exhibition area with an area of 20,000 square meters, which will be represented by more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid there will also be products of all kinds related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real delicacies for collectors and curious.
Among the participating companies will be the following: Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renewal; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, sale and renewal of cars; or Cochera Cl<0xC3><0xA1>sicos, specialized company Mercedes Benz.
Eligibility tests in the exterior
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: holding a concentration, sports performances, testing capabilities, presentations and competitions.
Eligibility tests will also be carried out on classic cars and motorcycles in an adapted circuit outside the exhibition area.
Mazda3 i-Stop: maintaining the sporty style
Mazda intends to show that kindness to the environment does not have any negative impact on the sports style.
That’s why Mazda3 also has a built-in engine stop and start system – also called a “stop” – which is a device that is currently only available with a 2.0-150-horsepower petrol engine.
This second generationMazda3 is characterized by good characteristics, which it achieved as a whole.
Surface treatment, vehicle design, population, behaviour, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent at Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver’s seat, have excellent ergonomics and are perfectly fixed.
The steering wheel is also extremely soft.
Using a set of tools and consoles, we will conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend in the development of futuristic design with many buttons and controls and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style partially reminds us of the style that also presents Honda Civic.
Thus, we can say that Mazda3 and Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and, more specifically, with Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
In addition, it is necessary to mention a large luggage space and regular shapes.
The automatic shut-off and engine start system is currently only available with a two-litre petrol engine and a 150 horsepower six-speed manual transmission.
This engine is a real treat. It is very gentle, characterized by a reduced noise level, its performance and lower consumption.
Although the most desirable Mazda3 is in the diesel version, all those who do not drive so many kilometers a year, should not exclude this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, because it is characterized by greater comfort when driving and reduced consumption.
As for the equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
In the case of serial equipment, it is necessary to mention in particular the lane monitoring system (RVM), which prevents the formation of a dead angle, traction and stability control, speed control, interior light-sensitive mirror, on-board computer with a large screen, parking sensors, audio and noise sensors, independent air-conditioning and sleep control.
And if the equipment was not enough, this version was equipped withPack Premium, for an additional 1,500 euros: adaptable lights twouxenone and sound system BOSE with CD holder, in addition to other components.
Conclusions
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its category.
It is mainly characterized by the quality of the materials used, its operation and a high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not travel more than a kilometer per year can choose this version i-Stop, which is only with a gasoline engine 2.0 and 150 hp.
The only drawback of this model is its higher price, which is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>21,770 for the Luxury version and <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>23,270 for the tested version -Sportive-.
For this high price, Mazda3 offers us a large dose of satisfaction for every day.
Luxury 'Premiere'
L.A. has a red carpet, as delicate as Penelope Cruz's hands, Nicole Kidman and Fergie's.
The stars shone more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of the brand 'Nine'. (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'lady'.
Slib FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, it is only used to view mail, without the ability to view a certain type of attachments or surf the network.
He enjoyed his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine rated him as one of the products of the year.
Seeing it outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount that is paid, for example, for the iPhone data plan.
After its success, the company began to offer two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of permanently provided free data services, for which, however, it is necessary to pay a six-fold amount for Peek.
FonPeek, which was presented yesterday at the Le Web event, is the European version of the invention and at the same time its third transformation.
It’s limited as well as its American counterpart, but it comes as a surprise.
The monthly maintenance fee is approximately 12 euros per month and includes roaming throughout Europe.
People traveling with a smartphone already know what it means to lose data services after crossing borders or to impatiently search for a cafe with WiFi (or Fon connection) so they can view the mail.
The idea of rooming for a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced a long time ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience, a person would need a PhD in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to be able to read a miniature letter.
The European Commission is constantly demanding that roaming tariffs be reduced so that they are accessible to the whole of Europe, which still has no desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home country.
The fact that such a device as FonPeek (it is interesting that it still has the name Fon, if it does not have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff, means that operators are starting to think differently and consider different offers that would compensate their data network.
Kindle is another fine example, offering downloads of books and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and is valid at the time of purchase, not after months.
And that's exactly what I expect to happen once in the case of FonPeek, it's about the possibility of buying with a permanent approach as Peek has already introduced in the US.
Not because I want to buy it.
I'll check my mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect this because I think it’s the best type from the consumer’s point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could be used on the computer.
The Color Michelle Loves
Yellow is undoubtedly the favorite color of the first lady of the United States.
To succeed Barack Obama as President of the United States, she chose the dress and coat in this color, she also chose the same color when accompanying him at the second most important moment of his life: the handover of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color - yellow-green with sparkling effects-, in both cases it was a three-piece set - a dress, a bag and a coat of the same fabric - decorated with a large embroidery or collar.
At first glance, it seemed that the first lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of the Asturian princess and wear similar clothes.
The fabric from which the clothes are made makes the two models very different.
On the occasion of joining the function Michelle used a large lace, in Oslo velvet with print.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with a medium high heel, now a similar model, but in gold color.
He also wears various hairstyles: this curly, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have work-related problems related to motherhood.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who intend to have a child.
This is the result of a study 'Fertility and career of Spanish women', conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The study involved 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 years and the results are clear: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities in the labor market because of motherhood.
The study emphasizes that at the beginning of the partnership life there are many differences in opinions on the number of children, whether they work or not, and also according to the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside the home, work part-time or do not have a stable job, start living with their partner earlier, give birth to their first child and have more children overall.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, are postponing cohabitation and motherhood, and have fewer descendants.
"Women between 35 and 49 years of age with stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years from the beginning of their cohabitation with a partner. This figure is 4.1 in the case of women who have devoted most of their lives to achieving their stable employment and therefore had to postpone the cohabitation of partners and the arrival of children.
The type of profession also has a strong influence on motherhood, albeit a minor influence on the time of starting a life with a partner,” explains Margarita Delgado, who is engaged in research at CSIC.
Another factor influencing the age of women at the time of marriage is the degree of education.
Research shows that the higher the level of education, the higher the age at which women marry and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group of 35 to 49 years, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at the age of 25.1 vs. 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with basic education marry and give birth to their first child even before they find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education do the opposite, preferring to get a stable job, before marriage and the birth of their first child,” says Delgado.
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of representatives: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I'm behind it'.
The representative of 'Joyeux No<0xC3><0xAB>l', one of the most elegant actresses of the international level, is thus added to other famous personalities of L'Oréal Paris such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Even before her, actresses Evangeline Lilly ('Lost') and Freida Pinto ('Millionaire from the Hut') entered this selected club.
The men's part of this cosmetics brand is also represented by significant personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelin's partner in 'The Lost').
Prices of British fashion
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most prominent representatives - designers and models, past and present - met at the annual awards ceremony held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted Best Model of the Year.
Manuel Vicente 's
Manuel Vicente donates thirty X-rays of the writers he met in his literary life (and in some cases in his ordinary life) in 'Esov<0xC3><0xBD> poker' (Alfaguara, an illustration by Fernando Vicente).
It does not do so in feared and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but rather seeks something similar to the core of the creative personality.
The journey brings excitement and Vincent does not spare any relief or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reading pleasure, even in the case of repeated reading.
Here are some observations.
"On the pages of this book, I have found that the Mediterranean is not the sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but it cannot be called: the enjoyment of anti-judgment, morality without guilt and innocence without any god."
About Samuel Beckett: "The nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote by his own nature and not by his intellect, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with blinding poetic humor, without meaning, as if it were the blade of a knife that almost killed him."
About Graham Green: "Our man has been passionate about this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure, and remorse, which is a spiritual privilege to reach heaven by the way of damnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the eight thousand peaks in universal literature, which must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall."
William Faulkner: "He was a strange man.
On his own, he said of himself that he was the heir of a farmer from the county, at other times that he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a big dream.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer caught on the bridge a confused cry of this man from Munich to bring his echo to the night of the 20th century in his literary form, running in front of himself and calling into the future and speaking sharply to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt and prayed, 'God, my beloved, make me stop writing like a woman.'
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved Spenser's verses: 'After effort comes a dream, / after a storm a calm harbor, / after a war of rest, / after a full life death.'
About Virginia Wolf: “You’ve also carried your depression in your luggage.
The husband fully agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her among the azaleas or that the birds were singing Greek.
Never before has a man been so patient and in love with a neurotic whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness.
About Pio Baroja: "What was it about Mart<0xC3><0xAD>n Santos other than to focus Joyce on Baroja?
What was the matter with Benet other than letting the Baron execute Faulkner's weapon?
What was the purpose other than to make himself famous at the expense of that man's fame?"
The cowardly aggression
Last week, my 70-year-old mother passed our neighborhood, in Fuenlabrada County, and a group of young people between the ages of 15 and 18 passed by the wheelhouse and our dog, a crusader rescued from a shelter weighing a maximum of six kilograms, without a word they kicked him twice.
Our outrage is all the greater, that we see nothing amusing in such aggression towards a small and defenseless animal, which, moreover, was on the cusp.
And the shock of the old lady after this incident, when she met these individuals on the walk, she also began to worry about her own safety, because such a demon-possessed man, who attacks an animal, is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man, or anyone who is weaker than he.
It happened at five o'clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in the usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog cried all day.
Of course, we have complained to the nearest police station, but we doubt that it was of any use, and in order not to raise sensitive questions, we note that these cowardly murderers were of Spanish nationality.
The outrage caused us to announce this fact.
We don’t understand what happens to today’s youth when they have fun tormenting a defenseless animal that gives us love, companionship, and friendship.

The Michelin tyre manufacturer, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially for younger motorists, as both these entities have reported today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of using a helmet, as it is the only means of preventing head injury or death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin states that this campaign is part of its transport safety commitments, which "means more than designing and manufacturing even safer products", and has confirmed that it is trying to achieve this goal in a different way, i.e. in the form of an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets while riding a motorcycle, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', is the first phase in which more than 500 motorcycle repair kits will be deployed to reach the general public.
Finally, Michelin pointed out that transport safety is "a constant problem" for this company, which is a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheeled vehicles and whose main goal is to continuously increase product safety.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are on the rise
After almost two years, the market for light commercial vehicles is starting to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represented an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, what’s more, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent bankruptcy, according to figures from the parent organisation of Anfac and Ganvam.
However, it is better to quarantine the positive data, as November 2008 is a very bad period for comparison and represented a 60% reduction compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of vehicles registered in the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
Since January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling into the category of light commercial vehicles: derivatives of passenger cars, pick-ups, deliveries, smaller trucks and light trucks/carriages.
And even the clouds that are most damaging to demand have not disappeared, even though they have been bought by private individuals, most of the purchases have been made by small and medium-sized companies, and in 100% of cases this is financing through third parties.
Other factors must be added to the restrictions resulting from the closure of the source of bank loans, such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of the bad economic situation.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the support for the purchase of 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention the persons on the business card of small and medium-sized companies, who intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level of not more than 160 grams per kilometre, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday from Ganvam again reminded that it is necessary to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles, as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
According to the sales association, in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to calculations, sales of passenger cars and 4x4s will decrease by 19%.
The auxiliary system at the handbrake is already a mandatory equipment.
As in the case of the ABS anti-lock system, it will also be with the ESP stability control,assisted handbrake systems, all this will become mandatory equipment for European cars.
In fact, they already form part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the others have a deadline for the removal of the deficiency, which is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aim to increase pedestrian protection, working in a way that can help prevent many collisions.
The auxiliary handbrake system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which the system detects after the driver steps down.
But it is not always possible to keep this pressure to the end.
According to a study conducted by auto parts manufacturer Bosch, a third of drivers who have an accident did not brake before the crash and half of them did not fully utilize the power of the brake.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires a maximum of the braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU itself, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 pedestrian-related fatalities could be prevented annually.
The reduction in this number will be even more significant—according to calculations it would prevent one in four accidents with an impact on persons—after the introduction of so-called intelligent handbrake systems.
In this case, the vehicle will be equipped with a system that (using a radar or camera) detects obstacles and reports them to the driver, except for light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help to increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not react, even if the collision cannot be prevented, the device will affect the brake as intensively as possible and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors to postpone plan for Opel until January
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April -probably April 8 - as Javier Ortega informed, the American manufacturer warns that to meet the recovery plan for Opel will need more time.
Nick Reilly, GM Europe’s new president, is working to ensure that every point of the plan is agreed with the party concerned first.
As a result, the final document, which will first be submitted to employees and then to the governments of the individual countries where the manufacturing plants are located, may be issued with a delay in early 2010.
GM, on the other hand, ensures that the Saab sale decision should be made on these days.
It is no wonder that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the American manufacturer to make certain decisions as soon as possible.
GM is enabling contacts with some of the new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also wants to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of a Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian group Converg.
In the event that it is not possible to reach an agreement with any of them, GM could sell some Saab assets to the Chinese company Baic.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year is still valid if it fails to sell.
Drive with Porsche Boxster Spyder
When developing this magnificent model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, so the weight shows only 1.275 kg.
On the basis of the first row, the automatic roof is in a canvas version with manual control, which reduces the weight of the wheels by 21 kg; in addition, aluminum doors such as GT3, which means an additional 15 kg less; removal of air conditioning, 13; reduction of the weight of the wheels by 64 kg, also to the weight of the other wheels.
And finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less and replacing the door handles with textile handles means another kilogram.
Also offered with a PDK dual-clutch transmission, a single vehicle with a hand-split six-speed gearbox was tested, mainly on California’s second-class roads, on mountain sections with many intricate turns.
His behavior can only be qualified as untouchable.
Weight reduction does not mean that the vehicle is not pressed to the asphalt.
On the contrary: we have not tested such a small and light model for a long time, which would at the same time transmit such safety when moving in a corner, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete able to warm up muscles in a short drive for the necessary time until we order him to sprint, brake, and restore the use of the engine...
Whatever we want, thanks to the steering wheel, which is as communicative as it is precise, whatever we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel, is what the car will do.
And he'll do it with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine at will
The sound of the V6 boxer, 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very subdued and can be reinforced by the option of 'sport' and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used in the Panamera.
Acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during suction or recuperation.
The hinges are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt roads that we drive along with the Boxster Spyder were quite damaged, but the car managed well to pull out.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and in some corners we encountered frost and gravel even in the advanced mornings during the dawn.
Definitely this ultra-light car is one of the most fun on the market, as it is a little more than just a modification of the Boxster S.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 for <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>70,831.
The "Bag Girl"
The girlfriend of Karl Lagerfeld, the icon of the Coco Cocoon series and the occasional 'starlette' at the shows of the 'company', the singer shows her face to the evil girl as vehemently as her Chanel handbags.
More than 'Bad Girl' or 'It Girl', it's 'Bag Girl'.
Baskonia has won in Israel
The box office won a brilliant 82-91 victory while visiting the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite numerous absences in the Duska Ivanovice team, and thus got to the head of her group after the big performance of Mirza Teletovice, who was the best with eight triple points.
The Vitorie Company was able to replace the significant absence of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertase or Mic with a great deal of commitment and collective work, although it had to suffer to the end in order to win.
In addition, the high accuracy of the circuit with 16 triple points contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match began with a bout for the Blues, who had stood on the mark from the start.
The fact that the first four baskets for Vitoria were from a distance, already indicated that they attacked the Israeli team very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first part.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alawite team opted for Baraca's inner play and Eliyahu's work, which was adopted by whistling and clapping upon returning to its original location to increase the advantage before the break began (34-43).
Teletovic had already started to show himself as the best in his team with 13 points, although "without six" in Splitter's rating already indicated that it would not be the best evening for the Brazilians.
But although the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided even in the slightest and the Maccabees wanted to remind Vitoria that not everyone wins on their pitch, and 'by the hand of Elias' they managed to win.
Eidson and Pnini certainly contributed to the return of the 'yellows' to the spotlight (50-49).
More inappropriate.
Members of Ivanovic, wounded, but not dead at all, needed several precise games to catch their breath, and then Mirza Teletovic's machine gun appeared, which three-thirds almost in a row and with the help of English and Ribase returned the score to a calming number (54-67), which they achieved on the third-place finishers.
The Alavians have skinned themselves in the last part and English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to prepare them for the deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter ruled out for foul seIvanovic did not rush and defended well, and although the Israelis were approaching the final minute (80-85), the match already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time during the season.
Injuries make it impossible for Unicaja to fight
Unicaja significantly lost in Greece to Olympiacos and left him the leadership of Group B in EuroLiza in a match that was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
Malaga’s society has not been worried about the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship, or about a rival, perhaps one of the sickest in Europe, and with a large budget.
The game in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to dream. Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one Guillem Rubia, lit up the pitch s12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although an arsenal of locals in the indoor game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis, turned the score 22-20, 13 minutes, which was the moment when the battle between the resistance from USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek team began to function and proved its superiority in both zones, where the absence of the English pivot due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez burdened the Unicaja team
Between internal players and Lithuanian winger Linas Kleizas with triple points increased the advantage to 44-32, 19 minutes.
The Impossible Responsibilities
The third part was very offensive on the part of Olympiacos, who despite losing by 19, showed superiority and even managed to make up the difference from the match in Malaga Malaga 66-48, the 27th minute, which shook the leadership of the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and last absence of Scottish pivot Robert Archibald, who was injured in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages of Unicaja thanks to the leadership and the triple points Cook and the contribution of Lewis left a certain hope n win 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos proved to be unstoppable thanks to the strength and superiority in centimeters in its zone.
Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to level the basketball average 81-62, 37 minutes, and Unicaja won and handed over the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you charge for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the salary they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit app, the search engine with the largest number of classified ads in the field of real estate, employment and motor vehicles in Spain.
The How Much Should You Take? tool calculates user salaries based on more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has available in Spain, using the form available on Facebook, where you need to put your profession, years of experience, age and city where you want to work.
During the week that the app works, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally “feels poorly rewarded,” Albert Rivera, responsible for the Trovit product, explained in his report.
According to the data that Trovit has available from its search engines in the UK and France, the Spaniards are the worst paid.
The British programmer takes <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>45,226 gross per year and the French <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>31,059, while Spain gets <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>24,000.
Similarly, the driver has a salary of 34,247 euros net per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst-paid waiter job in Spain is with 11,592 euros net annually; followed by the seller with 14,725 euros and the worker with 15,667 euros.
The most searched jobs on the network in the last three months are the driver, a part-time job and a social worker.
Brazil set a date for Zelaya's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The deposed president must leave the diplomatic mission no later than 27 January 2010, when his term officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, Chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows that he must leave the embassy by this date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27 after the end of his mandate, he has to leave and look for another refuge."
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the set deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by telephone.
After the November 29 election (when Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, that same week he tried to take refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually collapsed because Zelaya rejected the political asylum condition that the government, headed by Roberto Micheletti, was trying to impose on him "de facto".
Thank you.
After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation was the dominant mood in the markets, uncertainty has reappeared in the markets, which should not be surprising, because it is already a natural state in an environment where executives make decisions about a future that is inherently uncertain.
The remedy used by the central banks to stabilise the market was to recoup the debt by directly buying assets and indirectly releasing liquidity at a rate close to zero so that financial institutions could buy assets to deduct.
The central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases are practically over, and without questioning their inconsistent liquidity policy, they are starting to throw some sand into the mix, as the Spanish central bank did with its auction last year.
Investors therefore doubt the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we participate in the return of a reduction in risk returns.
The movement of the stock exchange and the differences in the bonds of the company have regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal level they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
The US, Japan and Germany have become a haven of choice for investors, thus widening the differentiation of the eurozone countries vis-<0xC3><0xA0>-vis Germany.
Spain was almost unaffected by this instability, but at that time Standard & Poor's came and threatened a new revision of the Spanish kingdom's qualification reduction.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not unhelpful for silencing moral risk advocates who have once again sought to strain the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy to stem the devastating consequences of limiting credit to employment when in fact a new day would have to be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents a tribal struggle between the Emirs for the restoration of power in the Emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that hides the deficit, elections and a new government is coming.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Dur<0xC3><0xA3>o Barroso.
It makes no sense for Ecofin to save Hungary from defaulting on foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro area Member State to fail to meet its commitments.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin will force the Greek government to be transparent and commit its own citizens to joint responsibility in the event of the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are before the period of normalisation of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses on supported positions they would be within the expectation.
In the Spanish case, while our differences in public debt will increase as will the debts of European companies, we do not have to worry.
If European differences are reduced and ours continues to expand, this would be a typical Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's affair is just an anecdote. When our leading indicators force most studio services to overtake their recovery scenarios and revise their 2011 ascent scenario, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, the Spanish economy warns of this looming threat to the Spanish economy.
Again, it looks like it will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, although for now "cautious, fellow drivers".

President Iberdrola Ignacio S<0xC3><0xA1>nchez Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n first intervened yesterday before the subcommittee of the Chamber of Deputies, where the energy strategy of Spain in the next two decades is being discussed these days.
After his intervention, followed by the speech of President Gas Natural-Fenos, Rafael Villasecy, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n provided the press with several remarks on the proposal, which he submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrola, Spain needs an investment of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>50 billion by 2020 and an additional <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>60 billion from that date to 2030, if the nuclear power plants currently in operation are maintained.
If this does not happen, the necessary investment will not be 60,000 million, but up to 95,000 million.
Iberdrola really believes that in the next decade, investment must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international connections.
From 2020, the question is changing and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas and coal-fired power plants with mechanisms for capturing carbon dioxide and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, it is considered that a new 18,000 MW is needed, but with other "supportive energies".
Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n, who believes the women’s bill for a sustainable economy, which has just been approved by the government, is in line with the line the company has demanded, did not want to let go of the royal decree to support the consumption of national coal, which opposes the policy of combating climate change.
In his opinion, the "clear long-term bet" in this sense, despite the "precise" measure, as President Iberdrola called them.
Whatever it is, Gal<0xC3><0xA1>n believes that investment decisions, albeit long-term, must begin to be taken now, because their maturation is ongoing and a stable tax framework is needed for their initiation.
Ferrovial wins Aer Lingus 'handling' at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for airport ground services, Swissport, will play the role of the preferred partner of Irish airline Aer Lingus for freight services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, which has not yet resulted in economic terms, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcal<0xC3><0xA1> de Henares signed yesterday a protocol of cooperation on the creation of the Centre for the Innovation of Intelligent Infrastructures
The association expects an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% belongs to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be the research of energy efficiency on highways and airports.
Acciona strives for its first motorway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first motorway concession in Australia, a market where it already operates as an energy and water company.
The building in question is a tunnel estimated at 1,700 million Australian dollars (about 1,047 million euros).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The 5km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the east coast has become the closest option for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction and concession highway company.
The city wants to have a tunnel completed at the end of 2014
After the selection of public-private cooperation (PPP according to the initials in English) for the further development of the project in the business plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of the toll.
The bids are expected to be submitted in May, with an estimated investment of 1,700 million Australian dollars (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,047 million) and in the final phase, three companies with a significant presence in European buildings will compete.
The group called Transcity is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia’s largest construction companies and the second, based in Italy, is one of Europe’s largest underground construction specialists.
Northern Direct, with the presence of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and the French construction company Bouygues, is against the Acciona Group.
The third and last group to pass through the network is called LBRJV, and is owned by the Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, represented here by the ACS), as well as the local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and a major firm specializing in civil engineering.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large constructions and privatizations, but carries with it a clear difficulty of entering in a different way than the indirect acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy followed by the aforementioned Hochtief or Bilfinger is, in addition to Asian references, still an example for Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of the quoted Leighton company.
Million Assets
Acciona is betting on the geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activities as an energy supplier and in the desalination trade.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and leads a group of companies that build and manage desalination facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use the common energy to enter the areas of construction and infrastructure operation.
The toll road, promoted by the Brisbane City Infrastructure Authority, called the Northern Link, is intended to connect the western motorway from Toowong to the Kelvin Grove ring road (see map) over 5 kilometres of the tunnel. This is the largest action to reduce the toll to over.
The schedule set by the local administration plans to be set for the summer of 2010 and the start of work for December next year.
Although this paid passage would open in the last months of 2014, the complete completion of the works is planned for 2016.
The tunnel began to be designed in 2005.
It will contain two currents in each direction, an electronic toll system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>308 million) to fund it.
Brisbane already offered this job Hochtief
Australia is still making Hochtief a significant profit, as yesterday it announced a contract with the government estimated at 154 million.
Through its local branch in Leighton, ACS will operate the national broadband network infrastructure with fiber optic cable.
This situation will allow quick access to the Internet for 400,000 people and will provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the 27-story King George Tower project in the Australian city of Brisbane. Construction work was just about to begin and Hochtief closed for $129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will be involved with Laing O’Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centres for 25 years.
The initial investment will be <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>75 million.
The FCC has allocated a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
The FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has received a <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>64.5 million grant for the construction of a 2.1-kilometer tunnel for the motorway in Slovenia.
The company won the contract a few days after carrying out work on the extension of the tunnel in Bosruck (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in tunnel construction.
Work is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and the implementation period is 32 months.
Mrs. Rushmore got an ad in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services over the past two years to Mrs Rushmore for an estimated <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>3 million a year, the railway company said.
The contract includes the possibility of an extension of 12 months each year. Ms. Rushmore was selected from among 16 agencies that appeared in the competition written by Renfe, of which four advanced to the final, among them TBWA, which has been responsible for creating advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be responsible for designing and producing the campaigns.
France Telecom fined <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million for curbing competition
The French competition regulator has imposed a fine of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>63 million on France Télécom for anti-competitive behaviour in the Caribbean regions that belong to the country.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and loyalty programs with consumers on the edge of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company bought more than 560 million euros in fines since 1994 for putting obstacles to its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and that there has therefore been a recurrence.
Trade with applications
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened an online app store in order to increase revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the beginning, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will be necessary to wait until 2010 to enter other countries such as Spain.
Playing in the Champions League has brought from the beginning 476.4 million Madrid and Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a
The Champions League has been a source of income for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
Listed by Manchester United.
Listed by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only a source of fame, it is also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
To the extent that the competition has distributed <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5,362.5 million among 105 teams (of which 12 Spanish) that have participated in this event since the inception of the tournament in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona came out of this division very well.
The white club was the third on the continent with the most money earned for participation, and the only one along with AC Milan to win the top prize three times.
The current champion of Catalonia and the last winner of the late European Cup in 1992 is in the fifth classification.
The list is led by Manchester United and Munich's Bayern, the two teams that also accounted for the most money for participating in last year's Champions League.
And yet she lost both of them to Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a.
On the other hand, Spain is only the third country to win the most money through the Champions League, despite winning the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated procedure used by UEFA to distribute the money.
For this fiscal year, the body, chaired by Michel Platini, plans to earn <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1,090 million for the Champions League.
From this money UEFA spends 413.1 million on fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary classification round (among others Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who took part received 3.8 million only for their presence, in addition to an additional 550,000 euros for each match they participate in.
There is also a prize for a win (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>800,000) and a draw (<0xE2><0x82><0xAC>400,000 for each team). The semi-finalists will receive three million each; eight quarter-finalists3,3 million.
Each of the last four will receive $4 million.
The champion earns 9 million, while the second finalist earns 5.2 million.
Thus, on fixed payments, the club will earn a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Bar<0xC3><0xA7>a won $2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are mobile payments, for which 337.8 million are earmarked.
This money is divided according to the relative value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main ones and has four assigned places.
Last year’s champion will receive 40% of the allocated money, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will take place this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>61 million for 29.9% Sauce
Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday announced the details of its share purchase offer, which aims to gain a top spot between 25% and 29.9% of Sos’s capital.
This percentage does not oblige to make a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.5025 per share, which it would pay in ten years and for which it would pay interest for this delay1% per year.
Yesterday, shares of Sos ended trading at <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>1.85; therefore, Nueva Rumasa’s offer values the company at 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The offer is conditional on the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the board.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to announce their interest in selling the stock.
CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruiz Mateose confirmed that it had contacted the regulator.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the capitalization of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, the sauce continues to change the structure of its management.
As an attempt to stay on the edge of possible bids to buy and settle the judicial fluctuations of its former leaders, brothers Jes<0xC3><0xBA>s and Jaime Salazar, the election of Mar<0xC3><0xAD>a Luisa Jord<0xC3><0xA1> as head of internal audit was announced.
This decision makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in a food business.
It is a newly created place that will be directly subject to the president of the group.
And it is not excluded from the controversy, as the company is still immersed in the legal battle for the alleged transfer of more than 230 million Sos to the Salazar brothers’ companies.
De facto, the possibility that in the coming months Sos will reveal new transfers of funds cannot be ruled out
As for the Salazars’ credit, former members of the National Court Ildefonso Ortega and <0xC3><0x81>ngel Fern<0xC3><0xA1>ndez Noriega (CCM and Unicaja representatives) testified yesterday and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million, without knowing where they were destined.
CNMV approves the option of exclusion of Paterna, which was attended by Inversora Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday approved the exclusion of Inversora Mer from Federica Paternin on October 9.
The Authority explained that it authorises this operation as it understands that its conditions comply with the applicable standards and considers that the content of the explanatory brochures submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December is ‘sufficient’.
CNMV clarified that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550,008 shares of Federica Paternin at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the company’s capital, which is 6,142,786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
He further explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been floated, which would not be transferable in any way until an offer had been closed, which specified that the price had been set by Federica Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New tools for valuing cars
These days, storms and accidents are not only earned by car services.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an insurance event are pulled into service, where the expert must estimate the damage and repair costs.
No insurance event is the same and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complicated job.
To calculate manually the repair costs from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and labor can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, it would be a matter of minutes
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Service providers and insurance event estimation and maintenance solutions are dedicated to collecting the information provided to them by manufacturers in order to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, of the American group Solera, is a leading company; 80% of the evaluations are carried out with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of valuation and information preparation tools on the sector are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Vel<0xC3><0xA1>zquez, Sales Director of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers work in Spain and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is still growing, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been listed in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new vehicle enters the market, these companies will start working.
It is a very hot job, because it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of the vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, for each model, "intelligent" graphic processing is carried out, where it is possible to "push out" individual parts of tourist cars.
As for the model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week if the process is very fast.
As for the minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information on 99.2% of cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about are Porsche, but not, for example, Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of traffic fleets, they exceed 99%.
To carry out the work of documentation and database development, Audatex has eight centers distributed around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) and each of them specializes in specific brands.
Its seat is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanical experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>90 million annually in the development of these databases.
Every month, 2.5 million data is entered and customers receive updates every two days.
The processing of this huge stream of information allows businesses to use and supply different products in different ways.
The most common use is focused on repairs and maintenance, but according to individual countries there are also tools for managing spare parts or for calculating the sales or residual value of the car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but in the United States they do.
With regard to the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get support that can be used by professionals in the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, with the star product being AudaPlus, a standard insurance event award solution designed for experts.
It includes cars, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes time for repair estimated by the manufacturer or paint shop.
This tool is applicable according to the application for each rating.
The highest price is <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>5.75 for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then every insurance company that makes thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow the complete identification of the vehicle and the equipment with which it exited the assembly line only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service for the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to eliminate vehicles with an overall insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations according to brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a particular brand went through service due to an accident or how many serious insurance events suffered during a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also designed for connoisseurs and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official manufacturer times.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a service provider and solution for the assessment of damage, accidents or maintenance of cars.
Gt Gu<0xC3><0xAD>a valuation is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in services, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
Turnover increased by 20% per year over the last three years and in 2008 they accounted for 10.8 million euros.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization of office installations in Paris began.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company’s sources, 62% of its brother is born in Europe and 38% in North and South America. He works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The global invoicing of Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach 557 million dollars, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will earn 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was listed on the $1 billion stock exchange and its shares are now estimated to be worth a total of $2.4 billion.
It has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 2007 and is included in the Standard & Poor's benchmark index.
Online auction of damaged vehicles
Last October, the Solera Group bought Autoonline, an internet base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The transaction involved the signing of <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>59.5 million of 85% of the company’s capital, which could be expanded by the remaining 15% next year.
The aim of the purchase was to provide more value-added services to customers with the ability to access a huge international market.
This valuation and buying and selling service is exclusively for professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, services, spare parts sales and professional dealers who must register before the start of operations.
This platform was established in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations throughout Europe, including 500,000 in Germany.
Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey stand out among the main markets.
The website currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been removed cannot be put back into service, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles with a historical value may be allowed to operate, although they have been decommissioned, after prior driving.
Budgeting service in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user gets a budget in only four steps: identifying the vehicle, finding a spare part, creating a budget for budgeting.
Ease of use is an essential condition for these systems, especially for the conviction of older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, are reluctant to use new management techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including 666 touring, 109 off-road, 137 motorcycles, 78 deliveries and 44 trucks.
Naturally, for use, a computer with an Internet connection is required.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a real graphical representation of the model will appear, and then the necessary spare part will be selected.
The user can include variables such as labor price, surcharges or discounts, and then print out and hand over to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include a workforce estimate.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can finance.
Currently, Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome, because it will allow, for example, to choose a door and turn it to show the inside.
