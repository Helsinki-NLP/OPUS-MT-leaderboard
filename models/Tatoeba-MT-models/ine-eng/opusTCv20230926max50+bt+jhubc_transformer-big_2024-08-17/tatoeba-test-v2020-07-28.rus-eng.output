I did everything you asked me to do.
Are you planning to buy a house?
On a cat's chair.

Be a realist.

Is it Chinese or Japanese?
Burn it.
I'm making progress.
You're pale as a ghost.
I'll be home by six.
French is not that complicated.
Let's get out of the taxi.
He was sitting.

Will you take the train?
We think so, too.
How could something like this happen?
You are actresses.

I forgot to ask.
My hands and feet are always freezing.
How to translate words that are not in any languages other than mine?
Could you tie it up with a ribbon?
I'll go home.
She always keeps her room clean.
I hate people like Tom.
I asked Tom to wait for us.
We're stuck in traffic.

I saw you spying on Tom.
I need you to do it immediately.
The robber entered the house through that door.
I know how to survive.

Mary's boyfriend's name is Tom.
I'm afraid I have something to confess.

I want you to stay with me.
He's in the hospital.
Don't forget to sign up.
You'll be safe there.

"Do you speak Greek?" - "Not yet, this is my first lesson!"
Why did you give him the money?
Did Tom buy anything for Mary?
Did you go to Boston last week?
I didn't play tennis yesterday.
Let me do this again.
We must respect their wishes.
How did you convince her?
I've been to Sapporo before.
I told you to get out of here.
We'll do our best.
Would you buy that?
Tom's gonna be late for the plane.
She always gets up early.
Do you want her to help you?
Do you eat rice every day?
We sat at the bottom of the audience.
You will survive.
What did she buy in that store?
When will we have a woman president?
He came here hoping to see you.
I'm glad Tom did it.
I'd buy it.
Have you ever seen this movie?
I know what you did last night.
The bus stop is not far from our school.
It's a cookie I baked for you.
England is similar to Japan in many ways.
Tom would never do that.
I suggest you try harder.
The bark of this dog does not scare the child.
Don't resist.

Tom can stay with me.
Is it hard to learn Greek?

Tell me why you're here.
Don't put the phone down.
Tell Tom not to get caught in the eye.
We looked out the window, but saw nothing.
You want to work with them?
Interesting was the movie.

It's a fake.
Tom is very emotional.
Why are you avoiding me?
What will happen to Tom?
I hope you don't catch a cold.
He aimed at the bird.
Tom will be released on Monday.
Come on, you!
I have to move on.
She stuck her nose to the glass.
There is no difference between ser and estar in English.

Tom didn't want to cry.
How much time do you have?
Writing an SMS while driving is very dangerous.
Tom said that Mary agreed.
Tom said Mary wasn't gonna win.
Why did you shave your beard?
I want to go back to this house.
How many pens do you have?
The black man was broken.
Why don't you go and kill yourself?
Tom was the first to speak.
Did you ask Phoebe to stop?
You swore you loved me.
I don't want Tom to think he has to explain it to me.
I was very calm.
Everyone has something to hide.
In the evening we will have several guests.
Her voice is still ringing in my ears.
Tom wanted to ask you some questions.
Time heals everything.
Why do you always take his side?
We weren't cold.
I saw a cat on the roof.
All men are the same.
You hot?
His son is a genius.
Don't miss the case.
Why don't we have dinner at the restaurant tonight?
Some birds did not fly.
What else do you want from me?
What did Tom ask you?
I told Tom you came to Australia.
You were looking for this?
Didn't you tell me you had a brother?
Where am I waiting for you?
I was really worried about you.
What did you find?
Can you explain that to me?
We were caught in a snowstorm.
The book is on the table.
I don't want any of them.
What do we lose?
You'd better ask him first.
He was fired against his will.
Take them to the hospital.
Did Tom tell you where he bought his pipe?
She never responded to his letter.
I hired someone for a job today.
Stop fooling around!
Tom wants us to stay.
I'm on the stairs.
It's the biggest car in the world.
Tom almost never asks why.
I have to get back to work.
Tom told me that's not how Mary does it.
Tom gave Mary all the money he had with him.
Where do you usually buy clothes?
I've already done that.
What's the weather like?
I sent her a message.
You owe me three hundred dollars.
I wanted to stop him.
I loved him so much.
Won't you introduce me?
We can't tell her.
I want you to know that I will always love you.
She said she was ready to do it.
She was crying.
I told Tom that Mary had to do it.
You're both idiots.
Do you like to live outside the city?
How long has it been since you've been here?
We finally have everything we need.
I wasn't busy last week.
I'm Tom's boss.
Who are you planning to go to Australia with?
Someone was screaming.
Which is better?
We are grateful for your help.
Go to your room!
I didn't tell Tom to leave.
What do your parents want for Christmas?
The train leaves at 3:30.
I know you're hiding something.
Release the beast from the cage.
He's afraid of cats.
You look like your father.
George is five years older than me.
Give me a cigarette.
Do as you're told.
Please, watch this movie.
Someone's calling.
I ran.
Why aren't you ready?
I can't fall in love with your new car.
You shouldn't have done that.
You're way ahead of Tom.
You can use his library.
I congratulated him on the birth of his son.
Mary says she needs more time.
Thomas stepped out of the door.
My dad is an English teacher.
At Christmas, Tom and Mary gave their grandson a bicycle.

It's possible.
I don't love Tom anymore.
Who's Tom with?

We both saw him.
We have a duty to help.
Tom just got out of prison.
Did you tell Tom?
I'm...
Tell me what you saw.
I think I've found what you're looking for.
Let your uncle think about it.
I fired her.
We need to know what Tom looks like.
I made a good plan.
I didn't know you had a cat.
I know you would do the same for me.
I can't believe Tom did all this.
I don't want to hear your theories.
Tom already told me what I wanted to know.
Only in philosophy can one use a vicious circle in proof and get a high appreciation for it.
I can't afford to have kids.
When I spoke to them in French in Paris, they were just staring at me, and they couldn't make these morons understand their own language.
Should I leave?
I was so stupid that I believed it.
She really did it.
I think it's very expensive.
I'll open it.
It's been ten hours, and my mother must be mad.
White bread, please.
Owls are cute.
Tom is illiterate.
I think Tom's still out of work.
We are perfectly suited to each other.
It's French, isn't it?
He doesn't like fish.
The danger passed.
We need more firewood.
Tom said Mary was upset.
Let me know if you need any help.
We have to get there before he does.
He must be missing her.
He says he's not sick.
Paris away?
What time is it in Tokyo right now?
He said he hoped to see you.
Tom and I did what we were told.
Frida Kalo was a Mexican artist.
No one knew why.
Jim's not coming tonight.
You'll be a father, you'll understand.
I saw you and Tom last Monday.
Where did you take your shoes off?
We went to the beach.
Do you think there will be snow for Christmas this year?
How was Tom's party?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I borrowed a tent from one of my friends.
I'll work for you as long as you pay me as well.
I'd like some coffee.
No one asked him.
I haven't seen Elizabeth in a while.
You're the only one here who likes Tom.
I know what Tom would have done.
You won't have a second chance.
Tom immediately agreed to pay the ransom.
I have to pay all the bills.
She slumped.
Tom said he was looking for you.
We're not as rich as Tom.
Tom drags Mary by the hair.
Tom didn't seem happy.
When I grow up, I want to be a firefighter.
Tom regularly eats sushi with his mother.
We forgot to sign up!
Tom said he likes it here.
No, I'm not tired at all.
She's the most lazy person I know.
Has Mary gone to her room yet?
This time I will forgive him.
I really like Chinese food.
It's easier than you think.
Tom was not a good coach.
He's sober.
Alvaro from Venezuela, he's Venezuelan.
Here's the bill.
He publicly insulted me.
Tom won't win any more.
Why don't I stay with you?
In induction hobs, magnets are used for direct heating of pots and pans.
I cried.
Tom wants to learn to play the trombone.
Get out now.
Can I have a look at your rights?
I'll take 1,000 pesetas with you to replace the lightning on these jeans.
How well do you know them?
Why did you ask Tom to leave?
You're too young to get married.
He forgot his sweater.
Tom lives in Australia.
I didn't know where to start.
Here's the memory!
Only love can break your heart.
I have two tickets to the concert.
I should have gone to Australia with you.
Tom's got a headache.
He dictated several letters to his secretary.
Why do you want to come with me?
Why are you in your pajamas?
How much does it cost?
I've never seen him so busy.
He likes to take care of the garden.
A cup of rice weighs about one hundred and eighty grams.
I should have left Tom a note.
Are you a Canadian?
You're stronger than Tom.
I've been waiting for Tom since the third half.
He likes it that way.
Tom knew that Mary was unhappy.
Tom and Mary do it together.
Has anyone else noticed this?
This sentence is not in English.
I think Tom's good.
She played the sonata.
You can write in any language you want. In Tatoeba, all languages are equal.
The infection is in the blood.
Tom didn't want to buy Mary a gift.
Does he know me?
I hate this place.
Someday you'll thank me.
Tom sometimes watches TV.
Am I ready?
I've been waiting for you.
I'm still not thinking well.
Run, chickens!
I had a terrible dream last night.
The network is huge.
You got me!
In my view, we should pay more attention to the current situation.
I know what you told her.
I only fell asleep after two hours.
Mary was not thirsty.
It wasn’t as hard for him to sleep as he thought.
I don't like it.
I was trying to wake Tom up.
They say the movie is very interesting.
Do something about it, please.
As you know, we are late due to heavy rain.
Apparently, she's healthy.
Tom was wearing a straw hat.
Take care of your little brother.
Tom said he's not going to wait for permission.
It's time to finish.
Have you had dinner yet?
I like bitter pepper.
What time do you usually get up on a Saturday?
I added milk to the coffee.
How can I change that?
Spain hosted the 1992 Olympic Games.
I never betrayed you.
We've done this together before.
My house is not far from here.
I don't care about money.
There are no invincible.
Tom's winning.
I don't understand what you're saying.
I know Tom can paint.
They're clogged.
I didn't know it would be impossible.
Are you having fun?
The man was sentenced to death.
Was it snowing yesterday?
You scared her.
You won't catch Tom.
Did you measure it?
Does Tom know French?
He studied Russian when he was young.
Put it back.
Tom and Mary are almost one year old.
I was impressed.
I advise you not to go.
We didn't discuss it.
Tom poured Mary a cup of tea.
Tom couldn’t understand why no one else wanted to go to the zoo.
That was convincing.
Tom shot Mary in self-defense.
How is faith different from trust?
Tom put the paper on the table.
What did you find out?
If the weather allows, tomorrow we'll go to the top of the mountain.
She and I both know him.
How's your wife?
I'm trying to solve the problem.
I could go to Boston with Tom, but I didn't want to.
Tom was reading an ancient manuscript.
The ancient Egyptians believed that the sun was the eye of the god Ra.
Tom saw that?
The more I thought about the problem, the more difficult it seemed.
His gray eyes glittered and glittered, and his usually pale face came alive and covered with blush.
What kind of pizza do you like the most?
Tom stood in front of Mary.
Here, have some more.
I'm looking for my passport.
His hands were blue from the cold.
Do you want to be famous?
Do this with caution.
I find it difficult to solve this problem.
The typhoon destroyed many homes.
This man was sentenced to death.
Call me as soon as you see him.
Is there anyone here who can speak French?
I think Tom still lives in Boston.
Let me take your luggage.
Besides, I don't know how to dance.
I love you so much. I can't wait to see you.
Why are you in my shoes?
The power is in Tom's hands.
I learned to play and play like my Japanese friends.
Well, what are you looking at me for?
No one's going to blame you.
I'm not busy right now.
Children like to play more than they like to learn.
He was adopted as his younger brother.
What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger.
Everyone tells me I look like my father.
Guess what language I'm speaking.
Tom thinks Mary's in Australia.
My boyfriend's a journalist.
Why are you calling?
I don’t like people who insist on talking about politics.
Is it red or white?
We are not afraid of fighting.
A few days later, Tom found another job.
Tom moved to Australia.
Let's go!
Do this until it's dark.
I didn't expect to see you again.
Tom's not used to that kind of work.
Bring your wife.
What, the moustache's suddenly in fashion?
Tom said he wouldn't want to spend so much time on it.
You're upset.
Our granddaughter was born yesterday.
Tom's pirate costume.
It's the pure truth!
Let's go get the tree.
What are these people doing?
I did everything I could.
Tom couldn't remember exactly what Mary said.
Work is my passion.
Why didn't they ask me?
Tom should be here in 15 minutes.
Tom hopes Mary knows she shouldn't do what John told her to do.
I don't drink wine anymore.
I'll save you.
We are proud of our achievement.
That's why I had to invite Mary.
Tom had to be punished.
Are you ambitious?
Tom ate all the bread I bought yesterday.
She's his sister, not a girl.
I'm not sure I understand you.
Schools and universities are closed.
I sweat every day.
She became a postman.
Don't leave me here alone.
I need to know everything.
We need a taxi.
Stop beating the cat!
What were you going to say?
I didn't attack them.
What crime have you committed?
How do we know that this man is the one he pretends to be?
King Harald Gormsson, better known as Harald Sinezubby, introduced Christianity to Denmark.
There's nothing we can do for you.
You were an honest politician.
Why don't you like him?
I'm in Russia.
He was careful.
Tom could have stayed longer.
Almost all of them were dead.
You have to get up early.
Nothing bad has happened.
The last few days have been very hot.
He wore a black coat.
I forgot to water the flowers.
I asked Tom to tell me what he wanted.
After that, Tom never saw Mary.
You can't go into this room.
You had other plans?
Who can blame you?
Can we call him now?
Tom is very talented and talented.
I'd like to talk to her again.
Mary said she liked the idea.
Tom bribed Mary?
Tom likes to read Hermann Hesse.
To be honest, I have never spoken Portuguese.
When criminal cases come to court, it is generally accepted that there were twelve people in the jury.
What was Tom doing at the Australian embassy?
Tom and I started dating.
The boys marched four in a row.
Tom was very confused.
I didn't know Tom was waiting for me.
This fruit is very acidic.
Tom left Mary.
Tom realized that something was wrong.
We had no idea that Tom was going to do it.
One more day has passed.
You have to do it right now.
I have to get an X-ray tomorrow.
His bag was badly damaged.
He was injured when he fell.
We are impartial.
I have mosquito bites all over my hand.
Tom, come on, we're gonna be late!
I'm sure Tom doesn't think so.
I don't want to know who kissed you.
Are you monitoring your weight?
Tom plays the trombone.
Are you from Tokyo?
I want her out of my house.
You probably won't be able to do that.
I'm sorry I doubted you.
McDonald’s is known worldwide for its hamburgers.
Tom made Mary an expensive gift.
Do you have any opinions?
Do you like these perfumes?
The castle is broken.
A diamond is a precious stone.
Take care of the cookies, Tom.
I don't want to talk to him anymore.
I have three French-English dictionaries.
Put it down, Sergeant.
No one can do that.
Tom promised to come with us to Boston.
To my surprise, he married a very beautiful actress.
How did you sleep?
I have a few minutes left.
Tom wanted to surprise Maria.
They want the best.
Tom works as a waiter.
It'll be cold tonight.
She says she'll be waiting for us.
Why do so many people suffer from low self-esteem?
Was that too easy?
What Alice faced while waiting for an answer was a sudden war. It was a loud noise, so sharp to break her drum cuffs, and so loud to reach the sky.
I lost him in the crowd.
We were talking about Jim when he walked into the room.
We can't just sit here and do nothing.
I know you don't know who I am.
Tom decided to quit his job.
So you can't go there.
Tom helped Mary get things into the car.
You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen.
I know what I've done is wrong.
Many books are published every year.
Tom reluctantly gave Mary the money she asked him for.
Why do you hate her?
My washing machine broke down.
You're from Boston, right?
We have to hire him.
I tried to solve the problem in vain.
You should have done your homework.
I was on the phone.
I don't think Tom and Mary are married.
They're right behind you.
This stone was so heavy that I couldn't lift it.
Why isn't Tom sleeping?
As he wakes up, so will he respond.
We rented a canoe.
Have you ever tried a banana pie?
The girl who gave me beautiful flowers is your sister.
Isn't Tom wonderful?
Is he your teacher?
The rich sometimes look down on the poor.
I know what Tom is afraid of.
I don't know where Tom bought his umbrella.
How do we explain this to children?
I didn't even know your name.
The monkey climbed a tree.
The language I teach is very complex.
Your child can walk.
Is that all Tom's doing?
I wish I hadn't married her.
You know we owe him a lot.
You know I'm married.
Do you really live alone?
I told you I'd be back.
Tom is my youngest.
Welcome to the real world!
We would like to ask you a few questions.
I firmly believe in his innocence.
The president has ruled for four years.
I'm glad you're happy.
I don't know if I'm ready for this.
What a long flight!
How much money do you have with you?
Couldn't you solve this question?
And Tom and Mary are here.
Why would Tom do that?
There are 20 floors in the building.
If you don't go, I won't go either.
You don't happen to know when Tom's coming back?
I don't have any pictures of Tom.
Can you wait a little?
Will you give something to Tom for Christmas?
She won't fire him.
I know you're working with Tom.
They don't know I'm Canadian.
Next month I will be very busy.
Tom tried to help Mary.
She likes this singer.
If he had followed my advice then, he would be a rich man now.
I made that decision myself.
Can you say that again?
I asked Tom to wait for us.
There was a strong wind.
Tom didn't have the guts to try to jump with a parachute.
How do you know all this?
He runs as fast as you.
We're not as young as Tom.
How long do you plan to be home at night?
The bag is empty.
Are you okay?
He's stubborn as a donkey.
I think you can be trusted.
She knew it wasn't right.
That's so cool!
Tom had a hunch that Mary would bring her new boyfriend to the party.
When I came home, he was watching TV.
Tom was talking in his sleep last night.
Tom is ready to defend himself.
You're never right.
Don't say that again!
I called him, but some girl picked up the phone.
Where did you meet them?
Mary told me she was going to win.
We have to stick to the plan.
I'll tell Tom you called.
Tom is very strict with children.
How are the negotiations going?
He was prepared for the worst.
The beginning of the story was interesting.
I thought Tom would be interested.
I mix mayonnaise with ketchup.
They always complain.
Tom's got a few bites.
Did you understand what she said?
You're kind of distracted.
Don't be mean to her.
I'd better stay.
He had a brilliant idea in mind.
She's resting now.
I refuse to leave Boston.
Tom said he wouldn't help me.
How do you know so much about Boston?
Is this a safe place?
I didn't know why Tom was late.
He lost his job last month.
Who were you talking to?
I want to believe that everything's okay.
She always keeps her room clean and tidy.
I suspect Tom will have to go to Boston next week.
Don't walk on someone else's land.
Tom watched in horror.
Tom's face turned red.
Tom didn't know what I knew.
Where did you and Tom stop?
You don't know Tom?
I believe in friendship.
We're done.
How's your new class?
Afraid of my own shadow.
Tom was very pleased.
Hunger was an abstract concept for him; he always had enough food.
We need a new curtain in the room.
Can you stay with them?
Tom arrived early.
I didn't know it existed.
He's left-handed.
Someone poisoned me.
Unfortunately, it was raining yesterday.
Looks like he's asleep.
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Are you afraid of rats?
How long do you want to leave?
She had legs.
This is a risk we cannot afford.
I want to discuss something that's important to both of us.
We need to get you to the hospital.
What is the square root of two?
Tom leaned forward and kissed Mary.
Tom was swimming?
I'd say you're jealous.
I never called him an idiot.
Tom didn't do that often.
I hope we don't do that again.
How many times have you helped Tom do this?
If you were my friend, I would be happy.
I almost believe you.
These jewels are expensive.
I don't know how you do it.
I saw Tom dancing with Mary.
By the time I get there, it's opening time.
I'm not sure what her size is.
He was also good with animals.
Tom and I ate together.
You really don't want anything?
Tom turned on the flashlight and went into the cave.
Who's your lawyer?
We'll go as soon as the rain stops.
Thomas walked away from the door.
We have to do this.
She couldn't help but think of Tom.
Tom told everyone that Mary was adopted.
Who doesn’t admire them?
He and I were crying.
You don't want to try it again?
Wait a little bit longer.
Why did you split up?
You can make butter, cheese and more from milk.
You don't have the authority to do that.
I have a project for you.
Tom saved me.
Are you related to her?
When you drink water, don't forget those who dug the well.
Did you know that Tom has a son?
I didn't know her name.
Tom asked Mary when she was going to buy a new pair of shoes for her younger daughter.
Behave decently.
You like jazz, don't you?
You're drunk.
I used to smoke.
Didn't you know that Tom and Mary were John's parents?
I wanted you to win.
I felt like an uninvited guest.
Are you popular?
The Russians won, as everyone expected.
He nodded in response.
Tom said Mary was happy.
I know you want to see them.
We're on the right floor.
You'll be fine if you try.
You weren't going to ask Tom for help?
It's worth a try.
Tom says I eat like a pig.
Can you say that in human language?
No one was hungry except me.
Tom is very excited.
No snowflake in the snow avalanche considers itself to be to blame.
Who did you want to talk to?
They can understand everything she says.
I don't want Tom to be here.
Do you have a German-Russian dictionary?

Tom has nothing to do here.
Try not to worry about us.
Stop right here!
You've helped a lot.
Don't knock on the door with your hand.
You have to consider his age.

You know why Tom doesn't trust Mary?
Show me your photo.
I meet new people every day.
I want to go on a date with him.
You tricked Tom.
What are you doing in my room?
We miss Tom so much.
He answered his parents.
Tom, have you eaten yet?
Who did you give it to?
I held him by the collar.
No one's asking you to do this.
I forgot it was April 1st.
Please stop singing this song!
Tom bites the dog.
I know you left early.
Tom's been doing this all morning.
I'm aware of the consequences.
The eastern and western parts of the city are divided by a river.
Why are you jumping?
Do you know anyone who speaks French?
Was he scared?
Tom invited me to stay the night.
I don't think Tom's to blame.
I'd really like you to stay.
I'm impressed with your French.
We both want to do it.
If the ice is warm, it will melt.
We could have done that.
The doctor said Tom needed an operation.
I recently changed my toothpaste.
Here's something for you.
This is your bedroom.
Tom is realistic.
Who's knocking on my door?
When and where did you meet Tom?
I'm here to see you.
I feel like an amoeba.
Our team came home with a triumph.
I went alone.
Tom was married to an older girl.
I listened to him.
Why aren't you sleeping?
Did he come to you with a guarantee?
Can you take a picture of us?
I heard you cry.
Show me how to do it!
Everybody shut up.
Let the dust settle.
Why are you so stubborn?
He stared at his Chinese teacher, but with all these hormonal things, he stared at almost every facet.
I am glad to inform you that I have completely recovered.
I've written a lot of Esperanto.
I like watercolor more than pastel.
I can't make exceptions.
He's thinking fast.
I can find them.
I'm here now.
You are entitled to a lawyer.
Don't sit too close to the TV.
I have my head almost every day.
To my surprise, he didn't give up.
You stole it?
She must be mad at me.
You don't understand, Tom.
My dad loves fishing, just like me.
Hey, it's me.
Dan has shown himself to be a supporter of the superiority of the white race.
I'll try to distract them.
I like the color of your shirt.
It's not me, I swear!
I don't think Tom speaks French.
My parents wouldn't understand.
I don't know what to do.
She asked me if she could use the phone.
Tom cooks better than I do.
He swims like an axe.
Tom didn't tell Mary he had to buy it.
She brought a broom.
"Tom, hurry up." - "I'm coming!"
I have a big problem.
We are not partners.
We have already faced this problem.
I'll try to say it in French.
I'm not like everyone else.
I was able to get two tickets to the concert.
He likes to boast about his father’s successful car business.
She's wearing sunglasses.
Come on, Emilia, your father's waiting for you.
How many hours can you sit in front of a computer?
Tom can barely walk.
A minus for a minus gives a plus.
A body in the basement.
Please, make a donation.
I really need to talk to you.
There's nothing to tell.
I prefer to travel on my own.
Ankara is the capital of Turkey.
I went to the bakery.
I prefer a simpler approach.
They're cool.
I spent the weekend with friends.
Jane's farewell speech made us very sad.
I try not to read the news.
What am I supposed to tell him?
You look mind-blowing.
I'm grateful for your help.
He couldn't contain his smile.
Wait, did you say "girl" or "boyfriend"?
I didn't try to kill them.
Education is the recognition of what you didn't even know you didn't know.
Tom agreed to help Mary.
You should've thought it through before you got her pregnant.
Tom says he won't marry Mary.
I caught two fish.
I think Tom's sick.
Tom's pale.
I'm not poor.
Professor Hudson is my father's friend.
Can I come too?
Is Tom earning enough to live in the city?
The interrogation is over.
Please turn off the radio.
He seemed unsure of his answers.
I've heard rumors about Tom and Mary.
Take off your jacket if you're warm.
There's so many of them.
He could not give in to principles.
Mary says she's alone.
You'll probably be out of here by three o'clock.
It was an easy decision.
Mary said she'd be here early.
I want to open my own restaurant.
Are you still buying lottery tickets?
Anyone can do that.
One language is never enough.
Mary told me she was Canadian.
You seem to be suffering.
Tom forgot to tell Mary about the party.
That's what people don't understand.
Tom is gifted with a rich imagination.
Finally, she solved the problem.
The main thing is to tell the truth.
I don't want Tom singing at our wedding.
It's all about work.
There was nothing wrong with my mind.
Tom maintains cleanliness in his room.
These three books belong to Tom.
He jumped from one topic to another.
It's a truce.
Did you tell him I was here?
Tom's coming in.
It's not cold today.
I accidentally put on Tom's shirt.
It seems that the robbery of the bank was planned down to the smallest.
He didn’t like it, but he bought it anyway.
Wait a minute.
I want to talk to you about something.
The bank is empty.
Why didn't you show it to Tom?
Isn't the weather wonderful?
We'll be there in half an hour.
I was swimming in the river.
Tell them to take the phone off.
Can you tell us what it is?
Say no to racism.
Tom's a butcher, right?
Don't make me kill you!
Which one do you like better, this one or that one?
They don't respect him.
There's no choice.
I want you to be my girlfriend.
Don't piss us off.
You can't answer that.
Tom has a lot of books.
Can you distinguish an alligator from a crocodile?
Wait, that's what?
My grandfather built this house.
You want to take this opportunity?
You can't stay here.
I did it for the first time today.
I came to Australia when I was a child.
You really want me to tell Tom that you killed his father?
I got a call from your teacher.
I'm your father.
Can I do it myself?
All the people were touched by his speech.
Do you know how dangerous that is?
He's running.
He sits next to his brother.
I'd like to meet him.
How old is Tony?
Can I take a shower in the morning?
All right, everybody, listen up, please.
Is it made of wood or metal?
I'm sorry.
I consider Tom my friend.
In hoping to remain ignorant and free, the nation hopes for what has never been and never will be.
Tom can barely breathe.
Dogs do not distinguish colors.
Tom poured water out of the bottle before filling it with fresh water.
Dogs are faithful animals.
Tom's house was almost completely destroyed.
You're so stupid.
Does Tom know you can't speak French?
There are two boats on the lake.
I won't tell you her name.
I knew it was a lie.
It’s better to be alone than in a bad company.
That's incorrect data.
There is a noticeable difference between them.
I know some of you think Tom is lazy.
I have to tell Tom not to do that again.
Are you disappointed?
I'll stop you.
I think he's pretending.
Come closer.
We stopped at the Hilton Hotel.
So it's worth telling Mary the truth.
I'll be alone after you leave.
Tom wanted to open the box right away, but I offered to wait for Mary.
She constantly complained that there was no money left.
Don't you think you should call Tom?
Something needs to be done.
She gave him a gift.
Mary's in her room.
Attention, everybody!
At that very moment, I fell in love with the language.
Tom's safe, isn't he?
Did you order that pizza?
I need you to help me with this.
Tom is a close friend of mine.
Don’t do two things at the same time.
You shouldn't be walking in the woods alone.
No one can see my tears.
Tom fell asleep again.
She really likes you.
I'm glad you're still here.
These bottles are reusable.
Tom has never kissed anyone before.
I'll tell them you came in.
I'll listen.
I haven't been home since October.
I am very happy to meet you.
I almost forgot about the meeting.
They had a wedding last autumn.
He's helping me.
Put your hands up!
Everybody knows we didn't do it.
I thought Tom had never been to Boston.
She learned to swim when she was five years old.
We complained to the manager about the noise from the neighbors.
I won't let you do that.
I don't think they heard us.
I thought you might need it.
Honesty is one of the virtues.
As you meet the new year, so will you spend it.
There are no books in the library in French.
Any generalization is dangerous, especially this one.
You could have stayed in Boston.
There's no one there.
Can you write it in hiragana, please?
We don't think it matters.
No one understands you like I do.
Behave according to your age.
Do you know how to juggle?
You killed your wife?
We exchanged greetings.
Tom still wants to come.
I thought they weren't coming.
I can't stand the suffering of animals.
I think Tatoeba's getting in the way today.
Sally made her brother clean the toilet.
There's a mess in Mary's apartment.
The conference room is busy now.
Potato chips are bad for your health.
Mine's not as good as yours.
I look forward to Christmas.
I've never seen you so happy.
He took a deep breath.
I think Tom's right.
It's depressing here.
Do you see the star?
Ask Tom.
Grab the rope!
You said it yourself so often.
Tom says he's not hungry.
It's always been that way.
Can't we fire her?
The artificial satellite was put into orbit.
I'm serious.
Are you sure she's sick?
It's too simple.
What will happen to our children if there is a nuclear war?
I told them the bank wasn't working.
Tom and I soon became friends.
He has a question.
I thought Tom was your best friend.
I feel very sorry for Tom.
There's nothing to tell me what to do.
Documents on the table.
I'm sure Tom didn't know that.
Tom didn't tell us how upset he was.
I knew it was him.
Tom's working.
I'm not working today.
You said that last time.
I know this better than anyone.
I don't know what Tom thinks.
I knew it was something like that.
You don't have anything to hide, do you?
You're lying to me.
Tom looked very young.
The account must be paid by the first of the following month.
My French is terrible.
We need help.
You're scaring her.
To me, Boston is a cold city, not like Chicago.
Tom was the victim of an attempted extortion.
I can’t speak for my colleagues.
Does Tom live far away from you?
Why didn't I die?
The dispute ended in a fight.
I didn't take it, you can check your pockets.
Tom came in yesterday.
I'd like to leave a review.
You chose the wrong man.
They took a big risk.
We have a white cat.
You may never be able to walk again.
He used to be better.
Tom wants to see us.
You weren't home last night?
If anyone can do it, Tom.
The meeting was cancelled because of the typhoon.
Tom was diagnosed with tuberculosis in 2013.
There was a car with mules on the road.
Tom speaks French with his grandparents, and he speaks English with his parents.
I don't think Tom has enough money to buy a ticket.
Tom was not easy to find.
Everybody's dancing!
I live with Tom.
That's where I met them.
You are not wasting your time.
The problem is that you lack patience.
Several events marked the onset of the twenty-first century.
Stop doing this, Tom.
Tom said he doesn't plan to do that.
This university was founded by Mr. Smith.
I told Tom to go to Australia.
I think you could do that.
Tom said there's no way to talk about it.
He got out of bed.
Trains follow the schedule.
I paid for Tom.
There are many people who think that it is impossible not to get confused in languages.
Why is Tom avoiding me?
Will the exam be today?
What motivates you?
He gave Leyla his computer.
Roll up your sleeves.
I was hoping you'd come back.
Do you think Tom will agree to meet with us?
It is said that in America anyone can become president, but probably not really.
Tom never forgot Mary.
The first on the list is Tom’s name.
What else have you missed?
Mary tried to calm down.
What time does the train arrive?
What time does the train arrive in Boston?
You didn't see that?
You need to call me.
Tom never suspected that Mary and John were dating each other.
When I get rich, I'll buy a farm.
I baked him cookies.
It's a neighboring country.
I called my son.
Why didn't she come yesterday?
Where can I sit?
You won't believe what Tom told me!
I'll give you some more time to think.
Translate it into French, please.
Take the cold steel!
She needs a cab.
The crowd grew quickly.
Mary told me she loved me.
It was Tom who told me what happened.
Hair and tie.
I'll find her.
Have you thought about what I said?
I am very sensitive to the cold.
We're looking for you!
She's loved by everyone.
Compare your answers to Tom’s.
Tom has a weak heart.
Tom will have to pay for it.
I didn't know what to buy.
Can you lend me a pocket knife?
Tom took off his beard.
Have you seen my dog?
Don't even try to do it yourself.
No one saw you take it.
I'm half Japanese.
Tom says he'll fix it.
You have to come back.
We already talked.
I can't believe I finally managed to do it.
Tom didn't know why Mary was sad.
Don't worry, the test is easy.
Why don't you just tell me?
Which month is the 13th?
I don’t know which book to choose.
Tom didn’t understand anything at all.
Tom can't stay.
I panicked.
He's wearing a white boy's shirt.
It's a tower.
I'm gonna have to wait.
Yesterday was Sunday, not Saturday.
Does anyone here know them?
They're watching you.
How much time do you need?
I think Tom remembered me.
That's what we can do.
He knows his shortcomings.
Tom told me he was interested.
You said you loved him.
Mary is dressed in a black dress.
We had lunch at the restaurant.
I'll tell him about you.
Tom never asks anyone for help.
Tom didn't say that to Mary.
It's okay.
There are many avenues in this city.
What are you wearing?
When was the last time you were in Boston?
They decided to get married next month.
They slept in the car because they couldn't find the hotel.
She's no stronger than me.
You haven't told Tom yet, have you?
She has a double chin.
We cannot force people to do this.
Let me take it.
I think it's Tom's fault.
I can't stand that color.
Do they sleep together?
We are very grateful for that.
I can't believe he's not married yet.
I didn't even know you knew.
I won't let her in.
Neighbors complained about us.
I think Tom's lying.
Looking back, I think you were right.
I shot a bear.
I've never talked to Tom.
I'm just saying we can't trust Tom.
She also has flaws.
I wonder why Tom needs it.
I think that's suspicious.
I'll pretend you didn't say that.
What are you doing Friday night?
Tom's not the only one in Boston.
Will you support me?
Why don't you like this plan?
I thought you were at work.
It's up to you to decide.
Are you ready to have fun?
Are you a friend or an enemy?
This picture reminds me of my childhood.
What happened last night?
We used to be neighbors.
Tom wasn't married to Mary.
Winter will soon end.
Titles and awards mean nothing to me.
Where did you find him?
The meeting was delayed.
I'll get to know you.
Did you have a good weekend?
Tom's drinking beer.
You don't want to do it, don't do it!
Tom had a good job.
Is it good or not?
You don't remember anything?
I need cash.
Bring Tom a drink.
What do you want to eat this weekend?
Come on!
Tom wants to be rich and famous.
She smiled at me.
He's afraid we'll get lost.
I can't call him home.
You should have apologized to Tom for his rude behavior.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
The boy ran to his house.
I don't know anything about Japan.
Tom was a taxi driver when he lived in Boston.
Tom is an optimist.
He's not going to buy a camera.
I did everything I could to help Tom.
I connect you with her.
She received the highest marks.
Tom can explode.
I think you'll be very busy tonight.
What color is your childhood associated with?
I left in a hurry.
I work for the good of society.
There are people here who need your help.
You can do it.
I was a little scared.
Tom took advantage of the half-breed.
I'd like to lie down.
Borrow me some notes or something like that.
I want to relax in front of the TV tonight. I don't want to leave the house.
He'll be here today.
The cat is dead.
Now it's only half past nine?
Tom went to the store to buy milk.
I'm not allowed to talk to Tom.
I don't mind if you smoke.
It is not safe to swim in this lake.
I cut my finger yesterday.
Tom wanted to have lunch with me tonight.
Tom doesn't look very good.
She put her hands on them to warm them up.
Tom said he's glad you're back.
My car is covered in dove shit.
Tom doesn't know about my existence.
Tom found Mary's door open.
Laurie home?
I decided to marry Tom.
I won't make that mistake again.
I don't care if we stay or not.
I told her to marry him.
I've waited my whole life for this day.
What did they do to you?
Did he pass the exam?
The plane went into a hive.
It wasn't him.
Do you have any friends in Indonesia?
You may have to help her.
Mary has lost consciousness.
Tom wanted to play chess with you.
Will you come to the concert with me?
Is that why you're leaving?
If I had the time, I'd be happy to visit you.
I don't know her phone number.
Where are your umbrellas?
I can't let you risk your life.
You're photogenic.
Read this book!
It won't happen again.
Let's talk about basketball.
Tom came to see Mary, not me.
I don't think I can do this for you.
"Hello," Tom said softly.
Where are you going?
I almost died yesterday.
I'm in a lot of pain.
She had no food.
I don't think Tom knows how long.
They're running.
The road does not correspond to the number of cars passing through it.
I think you're afraid of my dog.
Attack! Attack!
Look at the price list.
You don’t have to come to the meeting.
I was somewhere else.
Do you have any more questions?
A new proposal as a message in a bottle: one day it will be translated.
You won't find a job here.
Can you listen to me for a minute?
Everyone loved you.
He and I are soul mates.
I have a granddaughter your age.
I'm sorry I ruined your party.
I don't need a doctor.
Is that a bear?
How did you meet him?
I've never worked with her.
She started working in her new office.
Let us take care of it.
I think you're sitting in my place.
I planned to do it yesterday.
It's a bit early to drink alcohol now, isn't it?
My parents don't like the way I dress.
Anyone who wants to stay can stay.
It'll be interesting.
I hit him softly and hard.
Because it's worse?
It's cheap.
Can I take your hand?
He's green.
Tom heard the noise.
Tom gave Mary his phone number.
Who wants to cut the cake?
Tom hasn't slept all night.
Open the door!
You called the police.
You're too young to worry about cellulite.
You need to start watching the series when all the seasons have already been filmed!
Road accidents happen on a daily basis.
Where did you go skiing?
Were you in the barbershop?
The prospect is depressing.
I thought you'd never ask.
Give me the ballpoint pen.
The only way to find out what happened is to ask Tom.
I didn't sleep for two days.
She was afraid to travel alone.
You should find another way out of this situation.
Get lost.
Are you sure you want to do this?
Let's take a picture together.
I failed the exam.
Everyone already knew about it.
You'd better go help her.
The footballer made a huge mistake.
Will they come too?
She sleeps like a baby.
Tom forgot to release the brake.
This song reminds me of a girl.
Tom says it's urgent.
You don't know who I am.
The explosion shook the entire building.
Tom kissed Mary, and they hugged each other.
That's my cat.
Do you already have children?
Tom didn't want to have breakfast.
Tom likes them.
Tom doesn't even know why he was expelled from school.
Tom is a self-confident idiot.
It doesn't let me sleep at night.
He was transferred to another department.
I think you need help.
Don't look at me!
I went to Boston last month.
Let the cat out.
I know you're all panties.
Tom believes that throwing out food is a sin.
Don't look at me like that.
The road in this place bends to the right.
Tom's not busy right now.
When did you see Tom?
Why haven't you told Tom about it yet?
I'll never listen to you again.
I have no doubt.
I'm glad you helped me.
I think your English has improved a lot.
Let's go to church.
Tom swallowed the whiskey.
Was it hard?
He's reacting.
I've never met him before.
How much did it cost?
I need to see you right away.
I'm not hungry at all.
Show me your passport, please.
Sharks eat fish.
I'm still the same as I used to be.
Do you know the boy who is crying?
No one knew about it.
It's just amazing.
He said he would never do that.
The one who stole the pin will steal the cow.
Tom doesn't swim very well, does he?
I didn't give it to them.
Tom and I went fishing.
He was only a shadow of his former self.
How do we do that?
I can't believe Tom doesn't really want to come with us to Boston next week.
Don't let them in.
Everything happens.
What day is it today?
Let's give Tom another chance.
I just want you to accept me as I am.
I'm just a regular guy.
Wake me up before you wake up.
Is that true? Did Paul kiss Lily's lips?
Why don't you go there?
Tom didn't say he was coming with us.
Tom died a day later.
Tom and I need to stick together.
I've only heard good things about him.
I don't work here anymore.
Which one do you prefer?
Here's my ticket.
You can't compare yourself to us.
I saw the car explode.
The window's here.
Tom's mad at me.
Tell me more about Tom.
He's right behind you.
I'll never throw out my Playstation.
I don't want Tom to see me like this.
Hold still!
What's your favorite TV show?
Do you want to go to the movies tomorrow?
Thank you for your concern.
Tom's suitcase is empty.
Oh, my God, it's on fire!
I'm afraid you'll be lost.
I like to go to school.
I offered to help.
I'll be back in Canada tomorrow.
Thank me for your son.
I think her father's a lawyer.
I want to see a volcano.
I know the owner.
Your dog.
What do you mean?
There's nothing you can do about it.
Tell Tom I'm going to come to his house this afternoon.
They need you.
It's an orange.
What else can I do to help you?
I'm trying to impress her.
Can't you see what happened?
I didn't want to bother him.
The officer has instilled in his people courage.
Tom will never find her.
Anyway, I'm thinking about trying similar things right now.
I don't know much about hunting.
This is the first time I cook grilled meat at home.
You're avoiding me.
Why did they do that?
Tom would apologize to Mary if he thought it was important.
How many points do you have?
You're a gentleman.
Tom quickly became very famous.
Everyone already knew that.
If you want to be free, destroy your TV.
You mustn't lie.
I know Tom's about to cry.
Mom, look what I found.
I wonder what Tom meant.
I already knew that.
I've never met Tom.
Maybe that's what she said.
Who told you the story?
I don't want to argue with you.
I saw how he looked at you.
Tom was sceptical.
Tom should be home.
She was the one I was thinking about.
Tom showed the police his driver's license.
I cut my hair every month.
I told you I don't know Tom.
I didn't tell you to fire them.
It's an acidic apple.
The number of tickets was limited.
Send me a new catalog.
It must have been expensive.
Let’s not talk about school.
I don't know where she is.
If you go fishing tomorrow, I'll go too.
Do you take a job to the house?
According to mythology, Prometheus stole the sacred fire from the gods.
Welcome to the world of physics.
I wish we could spend more time together.
I know how dangerous Tom is.
All the passengers managed to get out of the bus before it caught fire.
I want to help you deal with this.
You speak French better than I do.
There are a lot of talented people in our city, but Tom is not one of them.
You have six unread messages.
Bring your best game.
We accept checks.
My bike's gone.
The stars were shining in the night sky.
I doubt that Tom will win.
"Eh, here you are so bored." - "My boy, everyone is looking for this world..." - "Here I am! Your Majesty, Ganon and his servants have captured the island of Koridai." - "Hmm. What can we do?" - "As written, only Link can overcome Ganon." - "As far as we can do."
Do you know who sings this song?
Is your watch working properly?
I'll see you Sunday at 3:00.
I was at your wedding.
Tom can barely swim.
You're doing great.
I met her on the way home from school.
I haven't read any of his novels.
Everyone knew Tom was dying.
Where's the hammer you used?
Tom wanted to learn to read.
I'm heading home to Tom.
Ken couldn't remember his name.
She said she needed the money.
Tom helped Mary put on a blanket.
A is a set consisting of elements c, b and a.
I'll be back by nine.
He has diabetes.
We can deal with them.
I was just wondering if you have any experience that you would like to share with us.
Tom slept without a blanket.
Pray for us.
What music do you listen to in the car?
That's what they told me three hours ago.
Take mine.
The French Revolution began during the reign of Louis XVI.
He was curious.
He loved us.
Did you get an invitation from Tom?
I want to swim in the sea.
It will depend entirely on him.
I met a classmate.
He is old enough to travel alone.
I didn't know how to answer his question.
Our city was engulfed in smog.
No one saw them leave the room.
Two big coffees, please.
We were talking about you.
What music do you usually listen to?
Without bread, we don’t eat.
There will be snow tomorrow.
You should have quit smoking a long time ago.
Stop kidding me!
Some of my classmates are full of nubes, they know nothing about computers.
Did you like the bike?
I thought Tom wasn't sleeping.
Tom was not allowed to leave.

Tom will be here with me.
It's hard for my father to stop drinking.
No one is suggesting that you do this.
He works at this company from Monday to Sunday.
Mary forgot to lock the car.
I'm old.
Tom left with Mary.
Tom began to laugh.
I'll call Tom tomorrow.
Tom has telepathic abilities.
Who is he by nationality?
Tom was sitting with John in the same room.
I didn't want to swim.
He was drinking beer.
In our time, it is most difficult for a man to be... himself.
I'll never talk to him again.
Sh-sh, Tom, wake up!
I'm tearing out my nose pads.
I did what I promised to do for them.
I'm a new teacher.
They're all kids.
She got out of herself and screamed at me.
Did you take your medicine?
Rabbits are very cute.
She doesn't trust him.
Time is on our side.
You don't know him?
I'm still in shock.
Do you like bowling?
I don't want to hurt my son's feelings.
Did you want to tell me something?
I doubt Tom's still mad.
You'll feel better in the morning.
What do you want to tell them?
We'll take her home.
Do you smell burnt rubber?
That's not what happened here.
When's your father coming home?
I get it.
Tom pulled out Mary's book.
I'm trying to help them.
I just got out of the shower.
Tom has a patient.
She didn't buy bread.
Tom and Mary are not married.
Tom will try to escape.
You're obviously tired.
We're champions.
Tom's going to die.
Tom said that wasn't enough.
Tom asked Mary to bring the salad to the party.
Her hair is wet from sweat.
I only buy soft toilet paper.
I saw Tom again last night.
Tom sat on the floor between the door and Mary.
How do you know how much it weighs?
The flight attendant is a master of compliments.
Tom's married to Mary, right?
All the benches in the park were busy.
Someone needs to tell her that.
It's working for me.
Vermont is located on the border with Canada.

The dynamite was invented by Alfred Nobel in 1857.
We have to intervene.
Tom told Mary not to worry.
You can leave if you want.
I know you shouldn't do that.
I suggest you let them go.
Take my glasses.
I've already spoken to this student.
What is the chemical sign of hydrobromic acid?
We have a lot of money.
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
I asked Tom.
I need to talk to a lawyer.
I think you should do it.
That's cool!
You don't want to help them?
Tom was dressed as a gardener.
I respect his views, although I disagree with many of them.
The sky is in the center of the city.
Who sent you?
She tied him a sweater.
I don't think Tom wants to go to Boston with you.
Tom wanted Mary to know.
Is it cheaper to call after nine?
You don't have to go.
Put it on the floor.
If only I could go with her.
Tell her no.
He didn't say anything.
You don't use them, do you?
How much money do you owe us?
Don't be late for school.
We had no chance of winning.
Do you plan to stay long?
We ate quickly and left at once.
There is a large garden behind the house.
You're stubborn.
Be careful not to put anything on your feet.
Start each meal with soup.
I'm afraid to be alone.
What was she whispering to you?
We couldn't find anything.
Did you call him at all?
He didn't stop the car.
He sat right in front of me.
The cat was open.
I brought the wine.
I'm unpopular.
It's his first day at school.
I want to see you until I die.
She's beautiful, too.
He told me he wasn't sure.
Can I suggest a different strategy?
They're dead.
The apples are big.
You didn't know Tom lived in Boston?
I don't want Tom to worry about that.
She sings?
I need to go to the bathroom.
I'm a doctor.
Tom listened with interest.
I think they're happy.
Do you understand Tom?
Let's get in the car, let's get in the car.
You're interrupting me.
She wondered what her lips would taste like.
A good coach trains this team.
The tree is sick.
The train was delayed due to heavy snow.
Why don't you give it to them?
What made you think I didn't want to go?
You need to go and support the girl.
That was my plan.
When was the last time you saw her?
I told him I was wrong.
I am a citizen of the United States of America.
He hates himself.
You are looking for this book, right?
It should have been you.
Mary left a hat in my room.
Is it drinking water?
She doesn't think so.
Do you live there?
What would you eat?
You don't recognize her?
I didn't ask if Tom was planning on doing it or not.
I'm falling.
I wasn't able to come for his birthday.
I thought Tom would be disappointed in me.
Tom is wearing new shoes.
Last year, she learned to ride a bike.
Help us.
Don't thank me.
Since it was winter, he did not go outside.
As I walked down the street, I saw a friend of mine.
How many houses are on your street?
The elephant trunks are made of ivory.
I'm not a kid anymore.
"How's life, Mike?" - "My name is Tom."
Her native language is French.
This coat is unfashionable.
She stopped smoking.
Tom was married then.
I bought this book.
Naiveness is its only positive quality.
My hobby is the collection of insects.
As a child, Tom lived in Boston.
I didn't eat for six days.
Can I tell them about it?
She was silent all day.
It doesn't matter what he says, don't believe him.
I've moved on.
Tom and Mary hope that their next child will be a boy.
Mary is always very welcoming, and she has a nice smile.
I won't let her die.
In all cultures, babies fall asleep under cradles.
This is the best restaurant I know.
You could learn a lot from them if you just listened.
What was I supposed to do in that situation?
I'm sorry I upset you.
He who has never left the borders of his country is full of prejudices.
It's amazing how quiet it gets when it snows.
Tom helps his wife.
He's in her room.
I didn't think you'd come back.
For many people in India, cows are sacred animals.
I turned on the imagination.
I thought we could do it.
My mother was against me riding alone.
I'm sorry, I didn't understand you that way.
You know what you're doing, right?
The machine translation cannot be trusted.
She hit me, not him.
You won't understand.
I was with her.
I can't believe you're getting married.
This river is full of fish.
His success was nothing more than a miracle.
She and I are peers.
Tom said I should talk to you.
Have you ever had these symptoms?
The prisoner is released.
What, they said, happened?
Could you leave the door open?
I'll have to wait for that.
I wasn't alone.
I needed them.
He's twice my age.
Tom knows what he did was a mistake.
Japan has a mild climate.
Check it again.
Don't judge Tom.
My mom finally came home.
I have four brothers.
I didn't let Tom do what he wanted.
He replaced the injured player.
Tom said he didn't believe it.
Our trip went very smoothly.
It is inevitable that one day I will go to France, I just do not know when.
When I woke up, it was almost noon.
Tom just pretends to be sick.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I know Tom's wife.
I agree with your view on taxes.
Tom's watching.
It's raining, we can open the windows again.
It's never happened to me before.
I don't think Tom's lost.
I was going out when the phone rang.
I don't have to put up with it.
Always give way to the obstacle on the right.
We are asked to appear in turn.
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
I don't like rain.
She may be pretty, but I don't like her.
I can drop you off if you want.
Tom told Mary that she was wasting her time.
Do you still have a problem with that?
I never asked her.
Nothing is as relaxing as a hot tub.
I really don't have that much time.
How can I cancel my wedding?
There is an open book on the table.
I'm sorry, I completely forgot about that.
You have nothing to regret.
She's my mistress!
The sound of your voice like a melodic song is siren to me.
What's it like to be married?
I thought Tom might be able to help.
Who called me?
What's your favorite American beer?
Tom knew why he didn't like Mary.
My fingers left fingerprints on the glass.
Chemistry is a wonderful science.
I feel like my French is not getting any better.
What is the best way to get a passport?
You may be able to help Tom.

Tom's got greasy hair.
Tom doesn't want to sell the house, but he doesn't have a choice.
There's more light outside.
I gave my sister a dictionary.
It's my dad's car, but it's gonna be mine soon.
Did you forget his name?
If I had time to do it, I would.
You see Tom's boat?
Thomas the Great?
This medicine will help you.
Stop the noise.
I have a stomach ache.
Do you know how busy I was?
Tom pretended to be busy.
I can't trust anyone.
She is a fan of Sex in the Big City.
You are so impatient.
You said you wanted this.
Treat him well.
Tom wants to take my car tomorrow.
Do you often have to do this?
Mary told me about her plans.
I thought you'd agree with me.
For Christ's sake, stop it!
Nothing compares to a glass of beer after a long day’s work.
What's the matter?
Tom left his bag.
Here are some interesting facts.
How much time will you need?
Let's rest here.
Are you wearing new shoes?
You can leave if you want.
Did you find the book you were looking for?
That's what my mom used to say.
She frowned when she saw the dog.
He's not above me at all.
Smoking is strictly prohibited.
This peach is beautiful.
Can you see it?

Go straight.

What house do you live in?
I told them it was ridiculous.
What are we living for?
Will it rain this day?
We know about her.
You could have helped us.
I don't drive very often.
I don’t like the ending of the movie.
Just get in there.
Just apologize to him.

I'm sick of you two.
I didn't know it was legal.
I love adventures.
Tom works at the library.
Were you at school then?
You haven't changed.
I don't know who it was.
Why didn't you wait for us?
Sorry, I didn't know.
Why didn't you sing with us?
Are you happy?
I decided to forgive Tom.
I'm starting to enjoy myself.

He came up and got on his knees.

No one seems to know him.
Tell Mary I want to talk to her.
How did you know who to give it to?

The situation is getting worse.
I choose where to eat.
Tom decided to buy a used car instead of a new one.
I just wanted to wish you luck.
She's breaking up.

Don't give it to him.
Run, or you'll be arrested.
Mary said she was very tired.
Tom has made it a rule to meditate every morning.
Did you check your calculations?

A room without books, like a body without souls.
Why did God try us so hard? What sin do we have?
What's your brother doing?
We need a volunteer.
Why is Tom so sure it won't happen again?
I haven't seen you in a hundred years.
I visited Tony yesterday.

I've been licking seeds all day.
The accent made me realize he was an American.
Maybe it's a problem.

Well, at least have fun.

I didn't ask you to go there.
"Who is Norman Finkelstein?" - American political scientist.
Get out of here!
Then what is it, I wonder? If it is not a sale of goods at home, then maybe it is a new way to get acquainted with girls?
Tom picked up the coin.
Why didn't you go to your room?
If there is no God, everything is allowed.
We're both called Mary.
I knew I had to marry him.
Are you still at work?
New?
Don't take anything for granted.
You're on time.
They know too much.
Don't laugh at them.
Please fasten the straps during take-off and landing.
It was Tom and Mary.
We both love seafood.
I've been waiting for this for a long time.
I turned down the offer.
You want to come with us?
Tom didn't eat.
I'm going to take too long to explain why this won't work.
Nothing's changed.
Did you build all this yourself?
I am looking forward to summer vacation.
Is it possible to formulate it differently?
It looks great from here.
Wooden houses are easily flammable.
Let's throw Tom a party.
The dog is still alive.
I'm going to college.
I know you lied.
The bed is very comfortable.
I'll report on it tomorrow.
He was safe.
She's sweating.
I want to hear your side, please continue.
I'll wait for his arrival here.
We talked about what we could do.
Tom doesn't know the size of Mary's shoes.
I need to think about it.
The meeting was scheduled for Tuesday.
My name is Jose, we're friends.
You forgot to mention that.
We don't need it anymore.
Can I have something to eat?
Tom can do it without our help.
Everybody's ready to go.
She said she could fix it.
Who set up the meeting?
I'm such an unlucky guy.
Tom wants to fix it.
I'm not going to have fun tonight. I need to get ready for class.

He is willing to give up his emotions.
We were shocked by the news of his death.
Why didn't they go?
I haven't seen you.
You're just stating the obvious.
He had cancer.
It's your own fault that this happened.
It's as accurate as a watch.
I know where you're going.
You take it all on the fly.
Let's get him.
Let's leave it till tomorrow.
Maybe Tom knows more than he tells us.
Let me tell you what you're doing wrong.
I wonder if I can do that.
I don't like doing this.
The cleaner interrupted the conversation.
A cat on a desk.
I don't want to be late for work.
You're not chromating anymore.
Tom was an avid smoker.
Tom put on his gloves.
It's hard to talk to Tom.
I was born in Finland.
Tom didn't want to help me.
Tom said he was worried.
Tom's not used to this kind of weather.
I wonder who will help him decorate the snowman?
I still don't know why Tom did it.
Do you believe in soul mates?
What's that noise?
My son has a hereditary disease.
That's disgusting.
Is it snow?
I'll call you back.
He lowered the glass.
I don't know if there's a country in the world where you can marry your dog.
The best defense is an attack.
She is getting married this autumn.
I'm sorry, I don't understand.
I thought it would be easier.
Is there anything we can do for you?
Is that clear?
I ate five avocados.
The Japanese live on rice and fish.
When will you be ready to go?
The investigation began last year with the confiscation of the computer archives of a man from the German city of Magdeburg.
How's life?
I can't tell you what happened.
What did you see?
What made you decide you couldn't?
We drove back through Boston.
Who's gonna believe that?
Thank you for the correction.
Are you crazy?
The stars appear at night.
Where did Tom get that scarf?
They wanted proof.
Tom's sharpening his pencil.
Tom doesn't know how to ride a bike.
I'm not talking about a teluga at all.
Why did Tom leave?
Why did you want to be a teacher?
I am afraid of wild animals.
How much more money do you need?
Mary laughed to tears.
I spent $500 in one day.
Tell them to go home.
Yeah, put it anywhere.
They didn't make it on time.
Now it's seven thirty.
I see you're awake.
I want to know who told Tom that.

You're from Boston, right?
Put it on my desk.
Tom came out of the water.
I was very proud of that.
You were ready.
You know Tom's brother?
All lizards can lay eggs.
You'll pay for what you did.
I'm out of hand today.
I asked them to stay away from it.
At the age of thirty, he learned to drive.
I'm glad he didn't get hurt.
Neither Tom nor Mary studied French.
I haven't laughed that much in a long time.
The kitchen knife wasn’t sharp enough to cut the meat, so I used my pencil knife.
Honey, I can explain everything.
You will soon adjust to the village life.
Keep a bucket of water close by.
You're not a child anymore.
I don't want to go to the lake.
They're unpredictable.
I can't laugh in front of the cameras.
We're all good.
The river is the deepest.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
I've told you a hundred times.
I'm very cold.
You should probably tell Tom.
They're dead.
Tom and Mary kissed each other.

You didn't know I couldn't do that, did you?
How did you feel?
Let's give Tom a chance.
I like the fruit.
Tom lied.
He sells cars.
Are you still in touch with her?
"Do you think he'll come?" - "I hope not."
Tom didn't expect Mary to win.
I hate hospital food.
I ate the caviar.
They shot at me.
She knows her husband's psychology.
We have to check.
Tom gave the gun to Mary.
He couldn't believe his eyes.
They were the first to get on the bus.
Let's wait till Monday.
Does anyone here know them?
There must be a mistake.
He can't afford to take a vacation.
I'm used to the smell.
Tom didn't want anyone to know.
How was your day?
It's your fault.
I told you what time to come.
Of course I kept my promise.
Our friendship has remained strong.
Have you ever talked to him?
It's a Japanese doll.
Let's get closer to the case.
Tom was sitting on the steps.
What else does Tom want?
Sometimes the lightning strikes twice in one place.
I'm not bragging.
Leave it for later.
Tom advised Mary not to leave the door unlocked.

Decide for yourself.
Were you surprised?

I'd like to go back to Tokyo through Honolulu.
You're not telling me anything I don't know.
I couldn't help them.
Tom was the last to leave.
Tom signed the petition.
You tried to talk to Tom about this?
You scared them.
She insisted on her innocence.
We don't know much about Tom.
How was your day?
Don't worry about my dog.
Now I understand.
Give me time.
