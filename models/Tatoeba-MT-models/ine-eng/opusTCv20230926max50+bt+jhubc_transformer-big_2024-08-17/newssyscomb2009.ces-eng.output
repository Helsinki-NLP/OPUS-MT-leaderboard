The triumph of right-wing populists in Austria, together they have 29 percent
The significant weakening of both sides of the current grand coalition and the significant strengthening of the right-wing populist parties have brought about, according to the first preliminary results of Sunday’s early parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian People's Party (<0xC3><0x96>VP) suffered particularly heavy losses, where the position of the current president, Wilhelm Molterer, is seriously shaken.
On the contrary, the election leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZ<0xC3><0x96>), the Coru<0xC3><0xB1>a governor J<0xC3><0xB6>rg Haider, is planning a triumphant return to national politics.
According to preliminary results, it remains the strongest party in the country of social democracy (SP<0xC3><0x96>) with 29.8% of the vote, but loses 5.5% of the vote against the last elections of 2006.
Even worse was the <0xC3><0x96>VP, which lost nearly nine percent of the vote with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of both these great parties in Austrian post-war history, and especially for the people who called the early elections, literally a disastrous result.
As early as the beginning of July, when the <0xC3><0x96>VP left the coalition, the people had a significant lead in preferences before the SP<0xC3><0x96>.
However, the voters apparently punished them for letting the government fail.
Already in the first reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the president of the party and the current Vice-Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observers believe that this could happen as early as Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party presidency.
Such a development would apparently facilitate the path to the increasingly likely exit from the election result, i.e. to the restoration of the large SP<0xC3><0x96> and <0xC3><0x96>VP coalition.
However, due to the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties - the Free Party (FP<0xC3><0x96>) won 18 percent of the vote and the BZ<0xC3><0x96> eleven percent of the vote - the Social Democrats at the same time voiced concerns about the repeat of 1999, when the peoples agreed with the populists (then still the FP<0xC3><0x96> was united, since the BZ<0xC3><0x96> was formed in 2005).
Haider is apparently betting on this development, who has already stated that he is ready to cooperate with any party and expects a return to Vienna to national politics.
The Green Party, however, easily lost and fell between the Austrian political parties from third to fifth place.
None of the other parties apparently crossed the 4% threshold and did not get into parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India may be cold
If the problem with Czech scientists who were accused in India of illegally collecting beetles could not be solved, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karl Schwarzenberg, there would be a certain cooling of Czech-Indian relations.
The minister said this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it were not resolved, then yes, then there would be a certain cooling," he said after the meeting, which took place on the Czech initiative.
After the hearing, Mukherjee said that executive power can be difficult to intervene in court matters.
However, he said that in the case of Petr <0xC5><0xA0>v<0xC3><0xA1>chy, who was acquitted of the charges and fined, the central government could deal with the local government in Darjeeling, the jurisdiction of which falls.
"His problem could be solved," the minister said.
For Emil Ku<0xC4><0x8D>er, who was sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherjee said it would be best for him to appeal to a higher court.
He can then apply for bail and wait for the verdict to be released, he explained.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner had expressed the same in the negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then it would be possible to pardon him," the head of Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can get into the whole matter is to provide the convicts with “competent legal support,” the Indian minister said.
He also said that the Indian side is already providing such assistance to them.
“We are very interested in maintaining the best relations with India, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as the <0xC4><0x8C>TK said, he stressed in front of his partner that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider it a profound mistake to imprison and prosecute these Czech scientists," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question of whether he had received a promise from the Indian side to deal with matters.
“I’ve made quite a few promises,” he said.
The Czech Republic Judges the Battle for the Seabed
It will access a walled electronic map showing Australia and the surrounding sea areas.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty-member team of the UN Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea.
Its head, director of the division, Czech lawyer V<0xC3><0xA1>clav Mikulka, monitors and sometimes complements the interpretation.
There is a lot of work and enthusiasm.
The seabed hides a little-known world, rich in natural resources.
Here you can find oil, ores and other mineral raw materials, but also previously unknown living organisms, which carry the key to, for example, the development of an anti-cancer drug.
The bottom is bigger than the land
Coastal states today began to vehemently apply for new underwater territories.
Under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Jamaicans enjoy the rights they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly an area of the so-called continental shelf, which often reaches up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the country.
According to the Convention, it has the exclusive right to all resources of the continental shelf.
"Simply put, the continental shelf is the part of the seabed and its subsoil that is the natural continuation of the continent under the sea.
It extends beyond the coastal sea, often even beyond the two hundred nautical miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by the country concerned to the Commission for the delimitation of the outer limits of the continental shelf must be supported by extensive scientific and technical documentation based on many costly surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
"One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
The Commission has so far examined five applications, namely Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only three countries have succeeded," Mikulka adds.
The world's most recent success was recorded by Australia, which was the first to significantly expand its submarine states.
But it has also gained New Zealand - the area of the seabed, which the commission admitted to it last week, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, about six times the size of the state itself.
The two countries invested millions of dollars in the survey.
The profits they will reap in the future from the use of the seabed will, as they promise, be invaluable.
Other States will submit their applications gradually.
They can do so up to ten years after they ratified the Montego Bay Convention.
Where the continental shelf ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, a convention declared a "common heritage of mankind".
No state has an exclusive status here anymore.
The right of extraction in this area shall be granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"The seabed is not a Klondike," says director Mikulka, adding that his "individual areas are legally clearly defined and their regime is contractually anchored."
Czechs in the Pacific
Part of the seabed today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
They are shared with other states of the former Eastern Bloc within the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, it was granted the status of a "progressive investor" by the Convention, as well as by investors from a few other countries.
It is licensed to mine in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean, lying between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is split there, it's an underwater replica of a Tater.
"It can be used on a total area of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich site of polymetallic concretes containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, Ind Pakshi Rajan.
Macedonian division worker Rober Sandev brings one such concreteness to the show.
It is reminiscent of a small potato or, in a bit of fantasy, a fabulous scheme, which according to legend revived Golema.
German Special Operations Forces were at the time of the liberation of the hostages
The Egyptian government has asked Germany for help in resolving the hostage crisis - experts have arrived.
When the situation escalated, the special forces were ready, but no deployment took place.
Further details of the circumstances surrounding the release of eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt are gradually being released to the public.
According to the Ministry of Defence and the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to the statement of the ministries, both experts of the Federal Army and members of the German counter-terrorism group GSG9, airmen of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Office and logistics experts from the Technical Assistance Service (Technisches Hilfswerk) were on the scene.
According to another statement by the two ministries' spokespersons, however, no German forces were needed on Monday afternoon, as the kidnappers let their prisoners go and fled when they recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has said it has accepted the aid offered by Germany as a support force for action on the ground.
"Fortunately, that didn't happen," said a spokesman for the Federal Ministry of the Interior.
The attackers kidnapped a group of travelers consisting of five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian and eight of their Egyptian guides on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the abduction in the desert area of southern Egypt, hostages were moved to the border areas between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers remained unclear until the last moment, as well as details of the release or possible payment of the ransom.
At the moment, the rescue is in order in Cairo.
Minister Steinmeier said that the release of the hostages is in the care of the German embassy.
He did not comment on the release details.
There is no information on when the rescue will return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, all five tourists should fly with special forces from one of the Airbus of the German Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House of Representatives Rejects Rescue Package
The first chamber of the U.S. Congress has narrowly dropped a $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones index has fallen sharply.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout package for financial markets in a vote of 206 to 227.
Despite all the challenges of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians on both sides, the majority did not find a program to ease the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic move, supporters desperately tried to convince critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic negotiators, called for approval before the vote, although, as he put it, the plan is not popular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that hasn’t happened yet,” he said.
During the vote, the Dow Jones index fell by more than six percent, or 600 points.
The reason for this was investors’ concerns that the state bailout package could fail.
Shortly before the end of the vote, the value of the index rose so that, after the notification of the failure of the package, it fell sharply again.
Experts are now counting on further serious turbulence in the international financial markets.
In order for the program to enter into force, the consent of the House of Representatives and the Senate is required.
Travel Agents Record Increasing Numbers of Reservations
It seems that winter will be good for German businessmen in tourism:
According to one study, travel bookings for the coming months increased significantly in turnover compared to the previous year - even by more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite weak economic growth, the desire of the Germans to travel remains unabated.
When booking for the winter season, travel agencies recorded a 31 percent increase in turnover compared to the same period last year, as reported on Monday in Berlin by the German Travel Association (Deutscher Reiseverband, DRV).
According to a survey by the GfK Market Research Institute, increased bookings are already available for the autumn months.
Thus, according to DRV, the turnover for October was about eleven percent higher compared to 2007.
The basis for these results are the GfK numbers, which evaluates booking data from 1200 German travel agencies every month and interpolates them to the overall market.
This result included the booking of trips that took place until the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak exchange rate of the dollar, travel to the United States is mainly required, the DRV said.
For these trips, the increase in reservations makes about a third.
In addition, the Germans are particularly sought after destinations Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic waters.
Above all, organized tours are on course, said DRV President Klaus Laepple.
In view of the rising costs of energy and food, the costs are "easier for the client to read than for an individually organised holiday".
Laepple explained that consumers can save money by, among other things, using discounts for early booking or all-inclusive offers.
Even in the summer months, the number of reservations was said to be very good, so there will be a higher turnover again compared to the previous year - although according to another study, the number of Germans who made a trip has decreased compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Endless repeated toast, beer made from plums and celebrities in costumes from well-known designers.
First time on the beer floor.
Susanne Kronzucker and I don't really have much in common.
She is a blonde, TV presenter and wears a tailored tailored cut.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing unites us: we are not even three minutes on the beer field, and photographers are already throwing at us and quickly filling up the memory cards - it flatters me, because I am at Oktoberfest for the first time.
This is how you can be friends.
It seems that my cheap suit has served its purpose.
I'm here as a tourist and I live north of the sausage equator, so my sense of comfort in the cut was rather limited.
But right after arriving at Theresienwiese, everything is better than it seemed.
Almost everyone wears a women's suit or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed - everything is perfectly normal.
The special looks at the stand with the bananas in the chocolate are gathered only by my apron.
One nun pointed out to me that I had wrongly bound her: "You are free on the left, in the middle of the virgin, on the right, widowed on the back."
I'll covertly shift the butter from the back to the left.
"All right," he says and laughs.
Others don’t care so much about subtle flirting techniques and wear simple braided hats with the inscription “To drunk to get dressed!” and stick out on passing naked buttocks.
A young man with such exhibitionist tendencies is named Bob, he is from England and came to Oktoberfest for the first time.
He looks "gorgeous," with an extended "ooh."
That's what he's telling me after he's relieved he's just had a drink.
Right next to one of those hydrants that everyone thinks are garbage cans.
So Bob is one of the dreaded “Wildbieslers” in Bavaria, as they are called in public by free-riding people.
Others do not have the good fortune to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight o’clock in the evening, the Oktoberfest takes place, with a crowd of health care workers taking care of the poor drunks.
The medics always appear in flocks - in four they wear covered stretchers from tent to tent.
They work just like most visitors to the beer fields: empty there, full back again.
Who lies under the banner of this coffin of forgiveness is not visible.
"That's the one that can't go on any longer," one of the medics calls me in answer to my question and disappears into the crowd.
Police have released the name of the victim of the accident.
The name of a 36-year-old woman who died in a hospital after being hit by a car in Essex was released.
An accident on Shenfield Road in Brentwood on Friday afternoon hit Carole Paulson from Chelmsford Road.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but later died.
After the accident, a 50-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of reckless driving.
He's already been released on police bail.
Turkey's diplomatic horizons are widening
Long before Turkey began trying to join the European Union, they wanted the European powers to penetrate deep into Turkey’s borders.
On the eastern bank of the Bosporus, perhaps only twenty steps in Asia, stands one of the best monuments of this unsuccessful imperial ambition.
The Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1>a railway station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Con in neo-Renaissance style.
That's what the tour guides will tell you.
The building sits roundabout at the end of the footpath with towers at each corner of the front, looking at the indiscriminate view from some provincial German town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building is slowly falling apart.
But once one gets inside the vaulted cash register, one can no longer doubt the size of the enterprise whose westernmost gate the station was.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium of the Anatolian-Baghdadi Corporation.
Germany, which became involved in the game of empires late, intended to realize its ambition to control the Middle East by means of this railway, which was to lead to Damascus, Baghdad, and on to the territory that is now Saudi Arabia.
But the German imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
Their ranks were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular units.
Relative isolation from surrounding areas, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone
British and colonial forces advanced from Egypt and drove the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And bad news also came for Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1>a station.
In 1917, the explosion of a munitions train destroyed its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was a sabotage.
Since then, they have been gradually drooling and history has been bypassing them.
However, today this gateway to Anatolia and further east serves - at least symbolically - to highlight the expanding horizons of Turkish diplomacy.
The ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) has created a completely new foreign policy for the country.
Relative isolation from surrounding areas, created by the frozen borders of the Cold War, is gone.
A new policy is now in place - Turkey is getting involved.
It is remarkable that the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran, and of course with the European Union and the United States.
In order to review the parameters of this new policy, I boarded a night train to the Turkish capital of Ankara, where I was supposed to meet one of the leading ACP experts on foreign policy, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - about ten and a half hours later - after a hilly ride on the railways, reminiscent of the old-world rhythms of the famous document Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish metropolis, designed as a new city for a secular state that wants to turn to its Ottoman past.
But the AKP, with its well-known Islamist roots, represents a paradigm shift in the Turkish consensus.
In the West, it has aroused suspicion, especially in Washington.
The taxi took me to the AKP’s main tent, an ultra-modern stone and metal building, purposely built on a developing suburb, surrounded by half-detached storehouses and shops to power, where middle managers in business suits – men and women – meet to snuggle around.
Suat Kiniklioglu could easily be a centre-right politician from almost every other European political party.
Jacket, tie, I'm sure he had a Blackberry.
"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey into its immediate surroundings.
“The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its borders.
Today we have to look east and west at the same time.
It wasn't a choice.
He had to do both.
'But surely the time will come, 'I asked myself, 'when might Turkey have to decide?'
"Turkey," he said, "didn't want such a decision to take place."
Then he pointed out that almost everyone I spoke to here said almost in memory: Turkish relations not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the Black Sea area are as beneficial to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, it seems that Europe as a whole can, metaphorically speaking, travel along these tracks east to Asia and the Middle East.
Back at Hydarpa<0xC5><0xA1>a station, after most of the night's sleep, I thought of the two German masters Herr Ritter and Herr Conu, who watched the building build a hundred years ago.
How surprised they would be if they found that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now be, in large part, in Turkish hands.
And as I waited in the port for the ferry back across the Bosporus, I remembered that in those days Turkey was called "the sick man of Europe".
So it seems that at least then there was not much doubt as to which continent should be entitled to this fascinating country.
Memorable Lives: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As a Guildford music leader since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrologist, September 11) was in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and choir.
As part of the district's music plan, he founded an excellent choir of young Proteus.
He was supposed to be 21 years old, but by the time Proteus sang for the last time in 1979, a few of us were almost 30 - we just refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (mythological shapeshifter) represented the choir's willingness and ability to engage in any music that was presented to him - whether madrigals or Messiaen, either alone or with the entire orchestra.
The musical adaptability created by such a young choir was often stunning, always exciting and all thanks to the inspiration of the one man and the enthusiasm for music, which remained absolutely unchanged throughout.
How often did Tod tell us to "let the music speak for itself".
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the music.
So sing it! "
His tactical technique was absolutely clear and precise, but it was neither dictatorial nor mayonnaise.
No matter what the standard of music was, he always picked it up.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If there was to be a conductor suited to the knight, then it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in the two decades he conducted the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years or so, I have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never been disappointed by any of them – and I have been inspired many times.
Tod Handley had such a great combination of size and personal modesty.
He hated the conductors who, in his words, simply "stretched one or two fucking peckers around the world."
Many of us will be missed.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your obituary by William Woodruff (September 25) states that "in 1946 he returned to economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... while studying at BSc, MA and PhD".
This is based on Woodruff's commentary on Beyond Nab End, but it's not accurate.
From 1946 to 1953, he taught economic history at the University of Nottingham, and at that time completed a dissertation on the British rubber industry, led by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published it in 1958 as the publication British Rubber Industry.
He actually spent the years 1950-51 in America as a researcher at Houblon-Norman and the summer of 1952 at the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he finally left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff passed this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philosophy
"I recommend José Vicente Resina's exhibition Flamenco and Life, because his documentary black and white photographs are amazing.
I was seduced by the simplicity and the strong charge with which it acts on the audience, and the consideration and respect for the photographed.
An exhibition that shows a lot of emotion.
Resino can capture magical moments."
Honda attacks for the second time with its bestseller
In November, Honda will start selling the second generation of the Jazz.
If the predecessor of this single-seater vehicle already had considerable space, it now offers an even more spacious interior.
This is complemented by improved engines that increase driving comfort and allow for greater fuel savings.
Evolution rather than revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although from an aesthetic point of view, the lines of the new Jazz are very similar to the previous model, there have been many changes on this single-seater car.
It is necessary to mention, for example, innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new engines.
Even before we explore the new model, it should be noted that the new Jazz comes on the market six years after the introduction of the first generation.
Therefore, the first thing we will notice is the fact that Honda needed a shorter period of time to rejuvenate this model than other manufacturers.
Although in Europe Jazz is a less well-known model, in other markets it has become a phenomenon in sales.
This is the case of Japan, the country where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002, and also during this year 2008.
Almost a million units have been sold in Japan since the launch of the Honda Jazz.
The second market was the old continent with about half a million pieces sold in six years.
However, Honda aims to increase sales of the new Jazz in its category.
While in 2007 this Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of Honda Jazz, in 2009 estimates are 100,000 cars, which would mean an increase of 17% in the European market.
As far as the Spanish market is concerned, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002, representing 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation of Jazz, the management of the Spanish branch expects to sell 2,000 pieces throughout the year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly ease the decline in sales in Spain.
The company’s management expects the end of the year with a total of 22 000 units sold, which is 4 000 less than in 2007 and a decrease of 16 %.
Despite this increase in sales, Honda increased its share of the Spanish market to 1.8%, compared to 1.6% last year.
In 2010, the Japanese company expects to reach 2%.
In order for Honda to achieve this share, it relies on the success of its next new model.
It is Honda Insight, a five-door compact-sized hybrid with a length of 4.37 meters, from which the Japanese company promises to sell around 200,000 units a year worldwide.
As for the markets, according to the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight is sold in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the old continent and Japan.
Honda Insight is expected to launch in the first months of next year as soon as it is unveiled to the public in Valencia in January.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has increased in size.
Its length increased to 3.9 meters (by five centimeters more), width to 1.69 meters (by two centimeters more) and axle spacing to 2.5 meters, which means an extension of five centimeters.
The height has not changed and is still 1.52 meters.
The increase in dimensions also led to an increase in the interior space.
This advantage was achieved by using a new platform, but also by placing the fuel tank in the middle of the car, which was already used in the previous Honda Jazz.
The volume of the luggage compartment - which has a double bottom system - also increased to 399 liters, 19 liters more than the volume of the luggage compartment in the first generation.
It should be noted that these dimensions are present in the version with the engine 1.4, since the volume of the luggage space of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Another improvement in addition to the external elements - such as the rear LED lights or the possibility of equipping with a glazed panoramic roof - is easier access to the rear seats.
The doors leading to the second row of seats allow an opening angle of 80 degrees versus 67 for the first Jazz model.
The second generation of Honda Jazz also has new engines.
Initially, this small model will be offered with two petrol engines 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both engines use i-VTEC technology, which allows for lower consumption, lower carbon dioxide emissions, and provides excellent power system improvements at the same time with high torque at full engine speed.
The first 1.2-litre engine has 90 horsepower at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
This engine - which had 78 hp in the previous generation of the Jazz car - has a consumption of 5.3 liters and emissions of 125 grams of CO2.
Compared to the previous engine, which for the previous generation reached 83 horses, it will now reach 100.
Honda Jazz 1.4 with a power of 100 hp has a combined consumption of 5.4 liters and emissions of 128 grams of CO2.
"Car Bee" Prevents Collisions
To make progress in the development of technology to protect against accidents, Nissan this time was inspired by nature, specifically bees.
This Japanese company has created a robot that takes the example of flying bees, and thus prevents crashes.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C, which represents the first step in precipitation prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Robotics Center for Technical Progress have developed the prestigious Japanese University of Tokyo, in collaboration with the Center for Progress in Science and Technology Research.
According to Kazuhira Doie, director general of public relations for technology, research and brand development, the BR23C is presented as an extension of Nissan’s four safety shield zones.
The robot aims to strengthen the ability to prevent precipitation in cars of this brand.
During the flight, each bee creates its own personal space of oval shape, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
However, the most important are the compound bee eyes, which are able to see in all directions at an angle of more than 300 degrees, which allows the bee to fly in its personal space without stopping.
When creating this visual feature, engineers designed what they called a laser range finder (Laser Range Finder).
It detects obstacles up to a distance of two metres in a 180-degree radius before the BR23C, calculates the distance of the object and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor, which immediately turns it into a collision warning.
“The moment an obstacle is detected, the robot mimics the movements of the bees and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels at a right or even greater angle to prevent a collision.
The biggest difference from any existing system is the fact that all maneuvers are completely instinctive.
If this were not the case, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobile Laboratory and chief engineer of the project.
Unlike bees, the robot cannot move up and down or diagonally, its movement is limited to only two dimensions and to the direction in which it is allowed to rotate its wheels, but not in an infinite number of directions and possibilities as in bees.
In addition to accelerating and slowing down, Nissan also used the rotation function to prevent the robot from collapsing.
“The device only needs to process the information every few seconds and maintain itself according to this data.
It does not require the retention of information or logical intuition from previous maneuvers, so it can work without interruption with just two dozen kB of memory.
It may surprise you, but we’re not talking about the giga or the mega.”
This is the first step in the development of new technologies for the immediate prevention of precipitation, a technology where Nissan predicts the use of mass-produced cars in ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible future use of this technology could be the integration of the unit into the GPS satellite navigation system, which would lead the driver to the destination and avoid obstacles on the way.
Enjoy the fear before you take out a mortgage.
It should be recognized that the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in addition to having enough capital to distribute injections, is also not lacking in ingenuity.
Faced with a crisis, and in order to prevent Americans from taking risk mortgages at banks with questionable solvency, he created a popular-scientific game "Bad Credit Hotel" on the Internet.
Or the "Bad Credit Hotel"... or the messed-up hotel.
The hotel and especially its reception desk look gloomy to make a person think once, twice or three times whether it is the right time to apply for a loan.
And above all, where to ask, which is probably her intention.
The fact is that the game contains useful information, although not too detailed.
It is a site suitable for young people rather than a space for the whole public.
What happens when the game ends?
There is a dream room inside the hotel.
At least something, because it's better not to talk about buying a house...
Morgan Stanley opens up its MUFG capital
Morgan Stanley Bank has announced that Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), Japan’s largest bank, is entering the middle of the market, issuing $9 billion to raise 21% of its capital. The adoption of this report was accompanied by a significant drop in its exchange rate.
A week after unveiling their preliminary agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG intends to buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s common stock at a unit price of $25.25, representing a total of $3 billion.
The agreed price is 19% lower than the book value of the securities as of 31 August.
MUFG is investing another $6 billion to acquire convertible securities, which will provide it with a 10% return and whose exchange price is $31.25.
Morgan Stanley has specified that the entire operation will take place on the basis of an average unit price of $29, i.e. 28% below its current rate.
Morgan Stanley's shares, however, lost 6.79% and rose to $23.07 around 17.00 Greenwich time.
“This strategic merger represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to banking holding status,” said John Mack, the group’s CEO.
Morgan Stanley adopted the new statute last week, which would allow him to diversify his activities, but at the same time it puts him under the supervision of the Federal Reserve Bank.
His merger with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis is forcing the biggest ace from Wall Street to take a far more cautious approach than before.
Conditions presented on Monday show, among other things, that the deal has been changed over the past few days: last Monday Morgan only announced that he would sell up to 20% of his shares to the Japanese for about $8.5 billion.
"A week ago we thought," Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained in Tokyo, "that our participation would consist exclusively of ordinary shares.
However, given the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and also to cover ourselves."
Based on the weighted average price, MUFG will pay Morgan Stanley securities 7% less than their carrying amount.
And the operation will result in a reduction in earnings from the stock by about 20%.
The agreement assumes that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferred securities into ordinary shares in a year if the latter are exchanged for a certain period of time at a price of 50% above the exchange rate, i.e. around $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital that MUFG will bring will allow him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and raise his cash.
However, the groups refused to provide more detailed information on the strategic projects of the two new allies.
Following MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley should boast a Tier One payout ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said he had "significantly" cut his balance sheet since the end of August.
The last few weeks have been challenging for the group, as its exchange rate has halved, while the insurance costs against the risk of default associated with debt have risen sharply.
On Monday, these costs took the opposite course, but remained high, at around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of Wall Street’s major investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the takeover of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, in part from Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett’s group.
Rafael Correa in Quito on Monday.
Re-establishing a republic around 21st century socialism.
Such is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Ch<0xC3><0xA1>vez, Bolivian Eva Morales and Ecuador Rafael Correy.
Last Sunday, the third nominee submitted to the vote, following the example of his counterparts and friends, a proposal for a new Constitution.
And his mission is fulfilled, as 64% of voters, according to official results covering 80% of the votes, voted in the referendum "yes".
According to these results, "No" gained 28%, 7% of the votes were invalid and 0.7% of the ballots were empty.
In order to pass the Constitution, he had to get half the votes plus one.
Two polls conducted in the east of the polling stations and a tally of NGOs predicted a clear "yes" victory on Sunday, ranging from 63% to 70%.
Rafael Correa, after all, on the night of Sunday to Monday, demanded the victory of his draft Constitution.
"The Constitution has won on the whole line," he assured and congratulated the Ecuadorians at the Guayaquil governorate, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
It goes without saying that Rafael Correa received his congratulations from Chavez and Morales, but also from his Chilean counterpart, Michelle Bachelet.
The vote, which according to the Organization of American States (OAS) observation mission took place peacefully, concerned a text on 444 points building a “new socialism” promoted by the president.
The draft Constitution devolves the power of the state over the economy by reserving it from the "development planning" of a country living mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and from the exchange rates sent by its emigrants.
The Correou-protected proposal, which was elected in 2006, also extends the powers of the head of state, who will be able to carry out two consecutive four-year mandates and be able to dissolve the House.
Correa has already announced that it will exercise this power and apply for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution, among other things, reinforces the principle of free health and education that the president began to introduce in a country of 13.9 million people, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
Finally, it also envisages a ban on the presence of foreign troops, thus ending the agreement between Washington and Quito on the use of the Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
In Chad, 19 hostages were released.
The Egyptian commando attacked the kidnappers of eleven tourists and their eight-member escort, who were captured ten days ago.
They're in Cairo.
Eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian guides, who were held captive in the desert for ten days, were taken alive and well to Egypt’s capital on Monday.
During the morning, an Egyptian commando was liberated in Chad.
The hostages arrived around 3:30 p.m., apparently in good shape, on board a special aircraft at al-Maza military base, close to Cairo International Airport.
They were immediately transported, without having the opportunity to speak in the press, aboard a helicopter to the hospital in Maadi, the outskirts of Cairo’s residential district, to undergo medical examinations there.
"They are completely healthy" and "no ransom has been paid to the kidnappers," Egypt's tourism minister Zohehir Garran said on the airport's runway.
Since being captured on September 19 during a four-wheel drive safari at the foot of Mount Uanat, on the borders of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, a group of hostages has been dragged from one hideout to another by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group includes 11 tourists - five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian - as well as eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, one border guard director of the agency Aegyptous, a safari organizer.
A senior Egyptian security official suggested that 30 members of the special forces, who approached the site on board two helicopters, had gone on strike during the night just before dawn.
"There was a shooting, half of the kidnappers were killed and the others fled," said the source, who wished to remain anonymous.
He suggested that a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special forces from the "flash" unit were sent to Sudan, where they gained the support of German and Italian teams.
The head of Italian diplomacy, Franco Frattini, from Belgrade, where he is located, mentioned the role played by secret agents and components of the Italian special forces.
"We have to acknowledge that we have achieved this result thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the people from our secret services, from the special forces," he said without further specifying.
He also denied that the ransom would be paid.
The Sudanese army said on Monday it had detained a four-wheeled vehicle carrying the hijackers, killing six of them, including a Chadian commander and arresting two.
The army claimed to have been linked to a group of rebels in Darfur, the Sudan Liberation Movement - Unity (SLA-U), which the movement immediately rejected.
Letters - The Silent Majority of the Ministry of Culture
The debate on cultural funding fills the pages of newspapers with headlines and is the subject of an ongoing election campaign.
That's better.
However, one area of our cultural life is still neglected.
Who will rise up to launder the poor sums that are provided for small museums, archives, archaeological digs, and national memorial sites that starve?
What politician dares to remind the federal government that they are forgetting their monuments and their historic buildings?
That in Quebec, as in Canada, we don’t have laws that really protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government is devoting three and a half million euros to the restoration of the Ch<0xC3><0xA2>teau Chinon in the Loire Valley?
It is written in the Constitution of our American neighbors that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the culture of Americans and that this heritage is to be protected by all citizens, all elected representatives and all regional organizations, in cooperation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of Societies for the History of Quebec, at least 40,000 volunteers joined 211 societies for history, monuments, archives and genealogy to cover up history, preserve a collection of private archives and protect archaeological remains for a few small ones.
Often it is these societies that are the watchdogs of our monuments, who, driven by hopelessness, protest when promoters and leaders unleash their bulldozers on old stones and forgotten cemeteries.
When will we finally see the grandstands for history and monuments?
Government of Benelux State Bank of Fortis
The Benelux states will help the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which was the first in Europe to get into trouble due to the spreading effect of the crisis of the US mortgage market, by partial nationalization: three countries will support the monetary and insurance institution, which has a capital share of 11 billion euros, also in Hungary.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and Dutch governments agreed to this at the highest level this weekend, with the participation of the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
Banka Fortis is the first in the euro area to be hit by a major crisis in the context of the international financial markets crisis, which has been spreading in waves for more than a year, and the decisions taken in this regard could be seen as precedents in some respects.
According to the decision, which was born on Sunday night, all three states will buy almost half (49 percent) of the bank's assets there.
The bank will sell with absolute certainty a part of its capital holdings, especially - mainly insurance - activities purchased last year from the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
Shares of Fortis Bank began to fall sharply last week, in the second half of the week there were already serious signs of crisis in the institution.
Analysts agree, however, that with its 85,000 employees, the bank is too big to let it crash.
The company's securities fell 12 percent on Friday, to a 14-year low.
Since January, the value of shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Given the current share prices, the total market capital value of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but this is unrealistic, according to the company’s executives.
The company’s management is also blaming the collapse of Fortis’ overseas-market uncertainty related to the adoption of a $700 billion U.S. package plan.
Stocks have already risen slightly on Monday.
On Friday, the new CEO, Filip Dierckx, was appointed as the head of the bank.
The money institute was also looking for private buyers, but with a more serious offer, no one has signed up yet.
The Belgian government has already announced that investors do not have to worry, they will not lose their money.
There has been no panic among the bank's clients and the branches have not been attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis Bank has a separate branch and has also acquired several leasing companies.
The fox in the henhouse
Life and health insurance companies in the United States often reject the possibility of concluding an insurance contract with a candidate based on people’s data on the purchase of medicines.
Data protection experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
“There is a data protection program that binds the use of prescription drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
It has to be in the hands of an independent person, otherwise we entrust the chicken coop to the fox," said Richard Dick, the author of the Washington Post's drug-prescribing program.
Insurance companies make insurance and the amounts paid in the case of insurance events dependent on the health status of the interested parties, and if the risk is assessed as too great, the insurance does not even close with it.
In the past, they sent the patients for medical examination and concluded the contract only when they knew their results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much cheaper procedure: based on the identification number, the customer from pharmacies can easily find out what drugs the person in question has bought in the last year and a half, from which the program itself derives, what he suffers from the disease and what his state of health is.
For example, if you regularly buy a large amount of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it indicates that you have virtually uncontrollably high blood fat levels, which will immediately put you in a category with a higher risk.
There are several versions of the program in circulation, some of them also determine the risk coefficient, so there is almost no work left for the insurance company in addition to paperwork, although there are minor difficulties.
Disadvantages include that leaky drugs can be used for several purposes, some compounds are, for example, useful against migraines or hot flushes, but are also effective against depression.
These are, from the point of view of commercial insurance companies, a significant risk-increasing factor, whereas the difficulties mentioned above are not.
In order to request and process the data, special companies have been created, which, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask the patient for permission.
They are now being forced to do so by the authorities, even though they have not been punished for their carelessness so far.
Some companies have recently also been processing the results of laboratory tests, which combine with data on the drugs used, thanks to which they can provide an even more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to the data, at the same time it will be more and more difficult to control their use.
There is a special law on the protection of health data, but its effectiveness applies only to providers of health services and insurance companies.
The bill, which gives the authorities the power to control even companies that specialize in providing data, is before Congress.
Richard Dick acknowledges that this is not enough: therefore, he has developed his program so that the transfer of data is bound to the express consent of the person concerned.
The other thing is that he can hardly refuse the permit in question, otherwise the insurance companies will not conclude a contract with him.
So chickens are a little bit referred to the list of good will.
The Global Marseille Menu
The European Union and India will double their trade turnover
As the European Union and India are each other's main trading partners, this topic has been dominated by, among other, mostly global issues, the agenda of the Ninth Summit.
There will also be a French-Indian summit today, which will focus on cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
The European Union recognises that India is a developing democratic power that should be given greater opportunity to speak on international issues, but Member States have so far failed to find a common denominator in supporting the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council.
This issue was not discussed further at yesterday's, already the ninth, summit in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as the current President of the European Union, respectively European Commission President José Manuel Barroso, and Foreign Policy High Representative Javier Solana welcomed Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they also agreed that trade turnover will not double to one hundred billion euros in five years.
Since the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this is not an overly ambitious target.
As a sign of this, twenty-six existing bilateral agreements with India on civil aviation have been legally aligned, so that air transport has also been given the green light in the future.
By the end of 2009, India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union.
Mr Sarkozy promised that negotiations would be speeded up.
The aim is to balance the balance, while the EU is India’s first trading partner, New Delhi ranks ninth among EU partners.
The summit also focused on global issues.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, respectively, terrorism - both sides in all its forms condemned and called for an accelerated convening of the UN conference.
They also called for an end to the Doha round of trade talks, although both played a large part in its failure so far.
The European Union has confirmed that it will insist on its energy and climate programme, namely that it would like to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India also agreed with this, as well as with the fact that at the climate conference next year it would be necessary to conclude a global agreement and reduce the production of gases causing the greenhouse effect by 50% by 2050.
Both sides would also like to avoid rising food prices and support the convening of an international conference to discuss the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India is today arriving in the French capital, where he is planning to close a trade deal on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
Paris believes that French companies will receive a commission to build India’s <0xE2><0x82><0xAC>20 billion nuclear reactors.
According to the agency's reports, the agreement would be valid for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
A large participation of Italian publishers at the international book fair in Frankfurt.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will participate in the 60th edition of the Buchmesse, the most important international meeting for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair expects more than seven thousand exhibitors from one hundred and one different countries to take up 171,790 square meters of the fair with more than four hundred and three thousand titles to see, with Turkey as an honored guest.
Deputy Minister of Culture Francesco Maria Giro will represent the Italian government at the inauguration celebrations in the Italian Pavilion: Italy will in fact participate institutionally with the Italian Centre (Punto Italia) – on 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by a press meeting at the Room Struktura Buchmesse in pavilion 5.0: it will be an opportunity to present the numbers, trends and perspectives regarding the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of books by foreign authors is still decreasing in relation to the total Italian production, mainly due to the literature for children and adults.
The plane of Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared a year ago
The rest of the plane was found by Steve Fossett, a millionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007, while flying through the Nevada desert.
The debris was discovered on a single plateau at an altitude of 3,000 meters, in the Mammoth Lakes area of Sierra Nevada, on the California-Nevada border.
There were no human remains inside the plane.
"The aircraft was found, we sent a team there, and now we're sure it's exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," Anderson said at a news conference.
The sheriff said no human remains were found on the plane or in the surrounding area.
A 63-year-old millionaire has been presumed dead since February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Bureau (NTSB) announced that hours after the debris was detected, an investigation team was dispatched that eventually identified the plane: it is exactly the Bellanc 8kcab, missing since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington, Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, near the Nevada border, some of Fossett's personal items were found in a pair near their home in Mammoth Lakes.
These are two documents bearing Fossett's name, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and one jacket.
Fossett's search was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire won a place in history thanks to a long collection of championships.
In 2002, on his sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete a journey around the world in an air balloon: a two-week solo flight.
Three years later, he circled the world in an airplane and without landing.
His many records also include a flight at an altitude of 15,445 meters, over the Andes, albeit with a co-pilot.
Glk, an ad you don't expect
One unusual Suv with an original design and precisely defined definite lines, wide surfaces with precise corners.
This is, in short, the last born Glk from the "compact" Jeeps of the house of the star, with the help of which Mercedes-Benz tried to bring a new twist to this sector.
Thanks to its unconventional processing, the unexpected and unconventional communication that accompanies the launch of the Suv Glk will be available in Mercedes-Benz showrooms from next October 17.
In this way, the advertising campaign, which accompanies the debut of the new vehicle, will also launch an unofficial way of communication thanks to the futuristic poster campaign in 3D, which is used for the first time in Italy for the car brand.
The project of maxi posters, divided into three different phases, will dominate the main Milan business class, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the introduction of the car in stereoscopic vision and with the help of special glasses, which will be distributed near Corsa Como, it will be possible to see the new Suv in almost real dimensions and in three-dimensional format.
Indeed, when you look at the picture, you will have the impression that the car will come out of the poster.
Then, thanks to the use of the innovative technology of Elumina8, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its small details, to then reassemble into a single image.
Mercedes is undoubtedly trying to introduce something new in the stereotypical field of automotive communication with this advertisement.
Will he be able to attract the interest of future customers in this way? We will see.
So we know who the Italian hooligans are
Trivenetians risk Daspo.
Who are the 150-200 boys and girls that Italy is now ashamed of? They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been watching the National Blues for years and which, to tell the truth, has never done too much trouble.
She's never even met her opponent's fans.
The orientation of the group is right-wing.
The founders are from Trivenet.
From Verona, Padua, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia, they were joined by groups (in fact, few groups) from Campania and Puglia.
They have three-colored flags on which the cities of origin of the participants appear: on Saturday evening they were removed so that they were not recognized.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they found real Nazi fans, Levski.
Figc made available to Italian fans 144 tickets to the match: all in name, thus easily controllable.
And Viminale really checked them all: among those who went to Sofia, there was no one with the ongoing Daslem, no one who would be forbidden to visit the stadiums.
Four blue fans, who had previously committed offences from the stadium, were denied a ticket and the match was banned.
Now Viminale is waiting to read the reports coming from the Bulgarian police, then he will take action: In this case, it is possible to give Daspo for five years at least to fans who were arrested or those who were identified during the riots.
International Daspo, which prohibits visiting not only Italian stadiums, but also all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, won't even go to one stadium anymore.
Lucky for you.
But now there is a fear of emulation: this means that more than one hundred and fifty more will be added to them.
"We must put out this fire immediately and not justify those who behave in this way," Viminal said.
So, "well-open eyes, mainly because of the national match on Wednesday in Lecce."
It is in Puglia that there is a small core of supporters.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio will meet, on Tuesday Casms, which can count on even one part of Aise, it is a secret service that takes care of the problems in the stadiums.
"Church Leader-Leader and tight arms during Mameli's anthem? In Bulgaria it is not a crime...".
Such is the idea of Domenico Mazzilli (expressed in a really unlucky way) who is the director of the Viminal Observatory for a few weeks (he got the place that was previously Francesca Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was formerly a quaestor in Trieste, where the core of Ultras Italia supporters, founded in 2002, is located.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to celebrate a leader, but, of course, that the behavior of these 150-200 fans is a disgrace.
“I am not a sociologist,” adds the Observer, “crimes are attributed to the country in which they occurred.
Until now, this group has remained within the limits, now we will take a good look at what has happened and evaluate for the future.
But let us also talk about the whistling at Mameli's hymn: it is not a crime either, but if you will allow it, it is unreasoning...".
